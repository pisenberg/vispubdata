			<abstract>
				<p>Human decisions are prone to biases, and this is no less true for decisions made within data visualizations. Bias mitigation strategies often focus on the person, by educating people about their biases, typically with little success. We focus instead on the system, presenting the first evidence that altering the design of an interactive visualization tool can mitigate a strong bias-the attraction effect. Participants viewed 2D scatterplots where choices between superior alternatives were affected by the placement of other suboptimal points. We found that highlighting the superior alternatives weakened the bias, but did not eliminate it. We then tested an interactive approach where participants completely removed locally dominated points from the view, inspired by the elimination by aspects strategy in the decision-making literature. This approach strongly decreased the bias, leading to a counterintuitive suggestion: tools that allow removing inappropriately salient or distracting data from a view may help lead users to make more rational decisions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>We often misweigh information based on its salience, or how congruent it is with our fears or desires. People often misjudge probabilities, like the odds of having breast cancer after a positive mammography <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Or once we have formed a belief, we tend to overweigh information that confirms that belief <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. These are cognitive biases. According to Pohl's definition <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, cognitive biases are phenomena that involuntarily deviate from a normative model and the normal course of information processing, in a predictable way (as opposed to judgement that is unpredictably inaccurate, for example due to misunderstanding information). Cognitive biases differ from perceptual biases in that they exist even after veridically perceiving information. To measure a cognitive bias, researchers use synthetic tasks in constrained environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. But biases also appear in critical real-world situations such as in the national security <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> or medical <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> domains, even for intelligent and open-minded decision makers <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref> (though see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> for a skeptical view of the ecological validity of many claimed biases).</p><p>Cognitive bias mitigation methods, known also as debiasing, focus primarily on educating the decision maker, (e.g., through statistics training <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>). They have shown limited or only temporary success <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, and are ineffective <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79]</ref> even in critical domains such as medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref> or policy making <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. A more rarely implemented approach is to debias the environment instead of the decision maker <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Previous studies that use this approach altered the design of textual information <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>, but did not consider the use of visualizations.</p><p>The visualization community has explored the idea that cognitive biases may arise during visual analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">98]</ref>. Dimara et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> found that in scatterplots, decisions among optimal choices (points in the 2D space of the scatterplot) were influenced by the presence of suboptimal choices, replicating the attraction effect. But when past research has explored ways of mitigating such biases with visualizations, results have remained inconclusive <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. For example, Micallef et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> explored whether Euler diagrams could improve probabilistic reasoning to mitigate the base rate fallacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and Boy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> tested whether anthropomorphized icons would decrease an impulse to dehumanize statistical data about suffering populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Sur- prisingly, neither study found evidence for the biases in the first place (such replication failures also occur in the primary literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>), and, consequently, if a visualization can alleviate it.</p><p>In this paper we take inspiration from the debiasing method of altering the environment of the decision maker <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> by using interactive visualizations. We focus on mitigating the attraction effect bias which has been reliably detected in visualizations in past work <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. We replicate the setup of that original study, across two studies, and contrast it to interactive displays that alter the decision making environment. In the first visual approach, we explore if highlighting optimal choices could help decision makers focus on the important information while ignoring distracting choices. In the second interactive approach, we explore a stronger manipulation where participants delete suboptimal datapoints from the display, encouraging a decision strategy known as "elimination by aspects" <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BACKGROUND</head><p>We next review methods for debiasing decision makers, and connect these debiasing approaches to visualization research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Debias the judge</head><p>Most techniques that have been employed to mitigate cognitive biases appear so far to be rather ineffective <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79]</ref>. Most of them focus on how to improve decision making by improving a participant's education or by increasing their motivation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Improve education</head><p>"Training in rules" techniques examine the benefits of formal training in economics (e.g., normative theory) <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, social and natural sciences <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, and statistics (e.g., law of small numbers) often by combining abstract rules for normative reasoning with concrete examples <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Unfortunately, these techniques require extensive training, and the improvements that they bring tend to weaken over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Stronger forms of training can be effective. Computer games and simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> provide immediate feedback, structured learning environments, and tailored instructions based on performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>. They have proven useful in reducing the fundamental attribution error, bias blind spot, and confirmation bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>, after the session and even eight weeks later. Computer games appear more effective than videos probably because they provide personalized feedback and hands-on experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>.</p><p>Other debiasing techniques teach thinking strategies. In "consider the opposite" decision makers are asked to consider evidence for alternatives in order to widen their sample of evidence, allowing to reduce biases such as overconfidence, hindsight or anchoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>. This technique, though, can backfire since considering alternatives overwhelms cognitive capacity -when people were asked to list multiple ways in which past events could have turned out, the additional load actually amplifies some biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Increase motivation</head><p>Other debiasing techniques attempt to increase the participant's motivation to solve a task, typically through reward incentives or accountability. Financial incentives can indeed improve performance for tasks that require more effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. For example, for decisions under uncertainty, one study showed that incentives did not affect mean performance, but they did reduce variance in responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, suggesting a more careful and consistent strategy.</p><p>However, these incentives typically fail to improve performance when the skills of the participant underlie the bias rather than their level of effort. For example, Fischhoff et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> showed that asking people to wager actual money based on their confidence levels did not manage to mitigate overconfidence. The automatic nature of most cognitive biases may render people unresponsive to incentives, merely motivating them to perform their "suboptimal behavior with more enthusiasm" <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Making people accountable for their decisions can also motivate them to put more effort. The assumption behind accountability is that people expected to justify their responses to others would anticipate possible flaws in their reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. However, this technique requires the ability to recognize mistakes. Furthermore, accountability can itself bias responses to be more favorable to the audience of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Rely less on the judge</head><p>Another way to reduce cognitive biases is to rely less on individual human judgment, relying instead on computational solutions or by aggregating multiple individual human judgments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Add computation aid</head><p>Actuarial methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> -incorporating statistical models based on past data -can be effective. In some clinical judgments that systematically suffer from judgment inconsistencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, automated decision support systems (DSS) can run consistency checks (e.g., on attribute weights or probabilities) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. They can also incorporate normative algorithms into the decision making process that would be difficult or impossible for human decision makers to compute <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>However, automation can trigger new cognitive biases when experts over-rely on recommendations from automated systems, even when there are clear indications of disconfirming evidence (e.g., pilots accept significantly sub-optimal flight plans from autopilot systems) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Encourage group decisions</head><p>One solution to debias critical decisions is to rely on the "wisdom of crowds", as has been implemented for cancer diagnosis, and financial forecast <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. Each member of a group forms a judgment independently, and a final decision is computed from the aggregated judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, making suboptimal individual strategies less influential <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref>. Moreover, there is evidence that making financial choices within a social network can help older adults to overcome their biases in financial risk taking (e.g., to choose retirement savings plans) <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>. There are also cases where deliberation and discussion can improve collective wisdom for responses to general knowledge questions (e.g., what is the height of the Eiffel Tower) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>.</p><p>In other cases of members forming judgments during a group discussion, individual biases can be amplified within the final decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>, Group interactions often trigger other cognitive biases where individuals shape judgments to be favorable to the group <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>, and group decisions are often biased towards conformity or polarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Debias the environment instead of the judge</head><p>A debiasing approach that has received less attention is to "debias the environment instead of the judge" <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Some of these techniques force a slower, more analytical process. In the medical domain, for instance, checklists, deliberate practice, and immediate feedback are suggested to help clinicians avoid diagnostic biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, though there is little to no empirical data to demonstrate notable improvement in decision making performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</p><p>Slowing people down is also possible by presenting information in a disfluent format, which can reduce confirmation bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. For example, jurors gave fewer confirmatory verdicts when reading a summary of a crime which required processing difficulty <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, though it is not clear that this change led to an objectively better decision.</p><p>Another tactic is to force people to consider information in isolation from its context, versus in the comparison with other information. In one study where participants distinguished fictional diseases described in text format, one group of participants read about each disease separately from each other, while another group saw simultaneously juxtaposed information from both, which allowed them to highlight the distinctive features of each other. The juxtaposed representation led to more accurate judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Summary</head><p>Decision making strategies have been divided into 'fast' processes that rely on automatic associations and tend to carry more biases, vs. 'slow' procedural processes that tend to be less biased <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Debiasing the judge through education in 'slow' processes can be difficult, as training often does not stick, or transfer to new problems. Relying less on the judge, through computational aids or group decisions, can lead to mixed success. Increasing motivation and incentives can decrease variability in responses, but does not decrease biases. This may be because if a judge only has access to 'fast' processes in the first place, more motivation may improve their attention and engagement, but cannot switch them to a less biased process. Thus, we hope to find success with the strategy of debiasing the environment, by altering the design of a visualization display to force the judge to take a slower and more deliberate approach that is constrained by the task environment itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Connection to visualization research</head><p>The visualization community has attempted to design and test visual displays that help viewers avoid misunderstandings and reasoning errors in data displays. Some studies demonstrate that misleading designs can cause viewers to incorrectly perceive visualized data <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. Other studies find that alternative visualization designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>, or the use of visualizations instead of text <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> can improve probability estimations. Improving performance in these domains can be difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, even for animated displays <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Errors in applying probability or logic rules are often associated with many documented cognitive biases.</p><p>Some studies focused explicitly on cognitive bias detection, demonstrating the existence of well known cognitive biases, such as anchoring effects or shifts in decision criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">97]</ref>, the attraction effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, or overconfidence effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, but do not test designs for mitigating these biases. Some studies evaluated promising design interventions, but did not replicate the original biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref>. Others suggest solutions for mitigating cognitive biases by training the viewers to avoid them. For example, we tend to see patterns in noise (e.g., the clustering illusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>), a perceptual bias known as pareidolia or apophenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>. Because this bias might occur in data visualizations as well, it could be useful to contrast datasets containing signal to other datasets constructed from pure noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>. One might envision such training being added to visual analysis systems to mitigate cognitive biases. In summary, previous work within InfoVis shows that cognitive biases affect visualization systems, and while many studies attempt to reveal and improve some reasoning errors, cognitive bias alleviation is challenging.</p><p>To alleviate biases, visualization research might seek inspiration from attempts from other domains. The most effective techniques seem to be the educational interventions of Sect. 2.1, video-game training in particular <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. However, their experimental design did not test multidisciplinary contexts or long-term transfer of knowledge. It is unclear whether a data analyst who successfully solved a confirmation bias puzzle can improve her reasoning during actual visual analysis, as transfer of expertise across examples can be difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Perhaps more importantly, extensive training is not always feasible for visualization users, though short-term prescriptions such as "consider the opposite" might inspire the development of visualization systems that encourage analysts to generate alternative hypotheses.</p><p>The approach of relying less on the judge, where human judgment is aided by computational methods or group decisions, also remains promising. Similarly, visualization systems can incorporate computation support or encourage collaboration among analysts to reduce cognitive biases. For example, collaborative analysis platforms running on shared displays (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>) could promote collective wisdom, and if we enhance them with ways to monitor individual and group decisions they could potentially reduce biases present in collaboration.</p><p>Our experiments focus on the design-based debiasing approach of transforming the environment of the decision maker. The studies of Sect. 2.3 provide evidence that restructuring the way information is presented can mitigate some cognitive biases. Nevertheless, those studies examined only textual representation formats <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>, and, although visualizations have been suggested as promising interventions for improving rational reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>, we know of no empirical evidence that visualization systems can mitigate cognitive biases. The next sections will focus on an empirical investigation of how a visualization system could mitigate a known cognitive bias: the attraction effect. The attraction effect is one of the hundreds of cognitive biases observed in psychology and behavioral economics research <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. We focus on mitigating the attraction effect because it has been observed in many real-world contexts, including purchase decisions or voting. For example, O'Curry and Pitts <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> showed how the attraction effect can influence voters in a "real world" setup, such as the 1992 U.S. Presidential elections. Recently, evidence shows that it also occurs in scatterplot visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">THE ATTRACTION EFFECT</head><p>In this section, we first describe the attraction effect and how it was detected in visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, to motivate the design of the two studies presented in this paper that investigate ways to alleviate this bias using different visualization designs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">What is the attraction effect</head><p>Definition. The attraction effect, or decoy effect, is a cognitive bias known primarily from marketing research, as it can strongly affect consumer choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82]</ref>. If people are deciding between two products ("target" and "competitor"), a third product ("decoy") that is close to the target but objectively suboptimal to both attributes, can make the target look more attractive. Assume two political candidates ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). Bob with a solid education plan but not for crime control. And Alice with a good strategy for crime control but not for education. These candidates are uncomparable as both can be good choices depending on how you weigh each dimension. Adding Eve that is similar to Alice (the target), but slightly worse (her crime control strategy is not as good) attracts the decision maker's choice towards Alice <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</p><p>Terminology. To explain the three alternative choices (target, competitor and decoy) we revisit terminology from Dimara et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>• An alternative dominates another if "it is strictly superior in one attribute and superior or equal in all others". • An alternative is dominated "within a set of alternatives if there is at least one alternative that dominates it". • An alternative is asymmetrically dominated " within a set of alternatives if it is dominated by at least one alternative, but is not dominated by at least one other". In the political candidates example, Eve is asymmetrically dominated by Alice, but not Bob. • We call a set of alternatives formally uncomparable if no one dominates the other (for example, Bob and Alice). • The Pareto front is the set of formally uncomparable alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> (highlighted in orange <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2 B)</ref>. The optimal alternative in a Pareto front is a matter of personal choice. • In a typical attraction effect experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, the decision task involves three alternatives, one that is asymmetrically dominated, the decoy, and two formally uncomparable alternatives: the target that dominates the decoy and the competitor that does not dominate the decoy. In other words, both the target and competitor are optimal choices (thus part of the Pareto front) and lead to the maximal payoff.</p><p>Findings. When the decoy is absent, participants choose between the two formally uncomparable alternatives according to their personal preferences. If the decoy is present, people tend to prefer the target over the competitor. This switch in preference is considered irrational because it violates the principle of regularity, according to which the preference for an alternative cannot be increased by adding a new alternative to the choice set <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Participants in such experiments are not expected to choose the decoy as it is a dominated alternative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The attraction effect in visualizations</head><p>The psychology literature had suggested that the attraction effect would disappear if more than three alternatives are added <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Nevertheless, work in visualization showed that the presence of multiple dominated datapoints in a scatterplot visualization does increase the attractiveness of other datapoints <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. We summarize the experimental design and the main findings of that work, as we adopt a similar design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Experimental Design and Procedure</head><p>Each participant was given 20 different choice tasks like the two seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>. For each task, the stimulus consisted of a scatterplot where the different options are lottery tickets. Each ticket has a probability of winning, and a prize (the amount that can be won). The options consisted of two optimal choices (one target and one competitor), and several decoys and distractors <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . The relative positions of these different elements were counter-balanced among participants. The participants, recruited on a crowdsourcing platform, first completed a tutorial and tests on probabilities and scatterplots. They were also informed that their remuneration depends on their performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Findings</head><p>As we see in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>, the points A and C are formally uncomparable: A is better on the horizontal dimension and C is better on the vertical dimension. Dimara et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> observed that when A was the target, having multiple dominated points close to it <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 3</ref>-left), people were more likely to choose A than C. On the other hand ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3-right)</ref>, when dominated decoys were closer to C (target) people were more likely to select C over A, even though the absolute values of A and C are identical in both cases. The reason for this inconsistency is the presence of the asymmetrically dominated datapoints (decoys).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Is the attraction effect truly irrational?</head><p>The attraction effect seems to be a robust cognitive bias that has been observed in many different contexts besides visualized data, such as when people buy commercial products <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> , choose a meal in a menu <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, choose an employee to hire <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, and vote <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref>. It has also been observed in animals like hummingbirds <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and even brainless amoebae <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> when selecting their food.</p><p>However, as explained by Dimara et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, in the case of visualizations part of the effect may also have perceptual origins. For example, regions with many decoys could be considered visually more salient than the isolated competitor. This does not invalidate the existence of the effect but it may provide additional explanation of why it occurs. Also, there are cases where decoys provide useful information that people can take into account in their decision. For example, a house in a region with many decoys may represent a larger market and therefore can be a more profitable investment <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. In the example of the Bets experiment, though, this did not seem to be the case. Participants were asked after the study to interpret the presence of decoy lottery tickets but they did not appear to provide reasonable justifications, nor to be aware of their preference of the target ticket <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Generally, the concept of cognitive bias is controversial within the field of decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Some researchers argue that cognitive biases illustrate irrationality <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, and others argue that some strategies that lead to biases can be effective in complex problems in the real world <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Therefore, InfoVis researchers are encouraged to verify if an erroneous response to a visualization task truly reflects irrationality, rather than a strategy based on alternative interpretation of the task <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p></div>

When using a scatterplot to make such decisions, even if the data are appropriately visualized and fully understood, user decisions may still be affected by the irrelevant datapoints on the chart.</p><p>The simplest way to alleviate the attraction effect from a visualization would be to hide all dominated options <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 2 A)</ref>. However, hiding the points assumes that the system has full knowledge of the users decision criteria, which may not be the case in practice. Moreover, inferior options can help understand dataset trends, and may provide useful context when making decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. We therefore consider alternative methods for bias mitigation.</p><p>We test two methods that change the environment of the decision maker (Sect. 2.3) in an attempt to mitigate the bias. We suggest two approaches with which visualizations can reframe a decision problem:</p><p>1. Information presentation. A visualization system can alter the way information is presented to the user (e.g., it can change the visual encodings).</p><p>2. Information management A visualization system can alter the way the user manipulates the information (e.g., it can enrich the interactions provided).</p><p>The first experiment presented in this paper, called "PARETO", attempts to mitigate the attraction effect by following the information presentation approach. The second experiment, called "DELETION", follows the information management approach. Both experimental materials are available at http://www.aviz.fr/deletion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">PARETO EXPERIMENT: THE VISUAL APPROACH</head><p>In the PARETO experiment, we investigated whether by altering the visual representation of the data we can help users to be less affected by the attraction effect.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experiment rationale</head><p>We changed the visual representation of the data to help users focus on the formally uncomparable (non-dominated) choices. An attraction effect choice task is divided into two subtasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>: the decision maker is expected to first recognize the dominance relationship among the different choices, consequently rejecting the decoy(s); and then to choose between the target and competitor. It is suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> that the dominance recognition process (first step) causes the bias. It is thus possible that by indicating the non-dominated options, users will not attempt an effort-full dominance recognition task, avoiding the bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Participants</head><p>No schooling completed, or less than 1 year 207 crowdsourcing participants submitted valid responses (107 for the pareto and 100 for the baseline condition 2 ). Participants tended to be educated young men. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref> summarizes their self-reported demographics (map and bar charts). As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, they were paid $0.20 with a bonus of $0.10 and an extra expected lottery bonus of $0.50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . The actual average bonus payout ($0.48) was close to the expected bonus. Participants rated their payment satisfaction with 4.3 out of 5 stars on average (this rating was done before they receive their extra bonus payment). The task portion of the experiment lasted on average 8'41" for the baseline and 2'14" for the pareto condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Experimental design 4.3.1 Stimuli and Task</head><p>The stimulus of the baseline condition was identical to the original study <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>: scatterplots showing the different lottery tickets options <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 3)</ref>. In the pareto condition, the black dots of the Pareto front were surrounded by an orange outline <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 4</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . In both conditions participants had to select a ticket that they felt maximized their benefit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Procedure</head><p>As in the original Bets experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, we ran the study on a crowdsourcing platform. The experiment procedure started with a tutorial and a test on probabilities and scatterplots. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, to better approximate a real-life decision, we informed participants that a computer will run the lottery, and for every winning ticket they picked, they will be paid a bonus proportional to the tickets prize. Then participants performed 20 choice tasks of lottery tickets presented in a scatterplot where they could select the lottery ticket of their choice. Participants in the pareto condition got additional information before their first trial, explaining that the highlighted (orange outline) choices are optimal and thus indicate all possible correct choices of their previous test. We clarified again that these choices do not have the same probability or prize but that there is no wrong answer among them and their choice depends on their preferences.</p><p>For each trial, participants selected a lottery ticket by clicking on the corresponding point, and validated their answer by pushing a button.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3">Design</head><p>The PARETO experiment had one between-subjects factor the visual representation ( baseline vs. pareto ). As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the positions of the target, competitor and decoys were counter-balanced within participants. In total, each participant completed 20 trials (10 pairs of matched tasks like the AC and CA in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.4">Measure: the attraction score</head><p>To measure the attraction effect, we used the same attraction score formula as Wedell <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref> (and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>), which was calculated on a perparticipant basis. Each of the 20 decision tasks was assigned a score of 1 when the ticket with highest probability was chosen, of 0 when the ticket with highest prize was chosen, and a score of 0.5 when a dominated ticket was chosen. We averaged all scores for the 10 decision tasks where the decoys were on probability (S prob ) and for the 10 tasks where the decoys were on prize (S prize ). The difference S = S prob − S prize is the attraction score. A participant not subject to the attraction effect should exhibit the same preference for high probability irrespective of the position of the decoys (contributing to both S prob and S prize ), thus her attraction score should be close to zero (for more details see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> The planned size was 100 per condition (as slightly larger from the original study <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>), but the exact number is hard to precisely control in on-line platforms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> After the experiment, we run an actual lottery to compute the bonus by i) running Bernoulli random draws to determine the winning status of each chosen ticket, ii) summing up the prizes of winning tickets, and iii) multiplying by a 0.0025 conversion rate from the scatterplot dollars. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Another solution to indicate the Pareto is to connect the non-dominated options with a line. Since here we only had two non-dominated options, we chose to simply highlight them with a colored outline, rather than introducing an additional line encoding that needs to be explained. When more than two Pareto points are involved, both solutions should probably be considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.5">Hypothesis</head><p>The research hypothesis was:</p><p>Hr1 Indicating the non-dominated datapoints in a scatterplot reduces the attraction effect.</p><p>This translates into the following statistical hypothesis:</p><p>H1 The mean attraction score of the pareto condition will be smaller than the mean attraction score of the baseline condition.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Discussion</head><p>We found suggestive evidence that highlighting the Pareto front helped participants to make faster decision and weaken the attraction bias, i.e., it reduced somewhat the influence of decoys. Focusing on the Pareto front may have facilitated a 'fast' mode of reasoning, but it did not eliminate the bias, though different highlighting techniques (e.g., using a stronger visual cue, such as a line) should be tested. Even if such techniques were more successful in mitigating the bias, any form of highlighting optimal datapoints would have other limitations. First, there may not always be a formal definition of optimality that a visualization system could use to highlight points. There are also other biases were highlighting the pareto front is not effective, for example the compromise effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>, where people chose more 'average' values from within the Pareto front; or the phantom effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, where unavailable alternatives influence choices within the Pareto set.</p><p>We previously investigated a visual solution to alleviate a decision bias. In this section, we search for ways to improve the interactions involved in the reasoning process by reviewing recommended strategies from decision theory. We first describe the two main families of these strategies, named compensatory and non-compensatory and explain our choice for the second. We then explain our focus on the noncompensatory strategy named "elimination by aspects" (EBA). We finally discuss how we can implement EBA in a visualization tool.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Compensatory strategies</head><p>Multi-attribute choice models suggest various strategies to support consistency in human decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. One family of strategies is called compensatory, in which the superior value of one attribute compensates for the inferior value of another attribute <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. One compensatory strategy is the "weighted additive" (WADD), in which the decision maker weights all attributes by importance and chooses the one with the highest weighted sum <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. Many visualization tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70]</ref> support the WADD by allowing users to combine attributes into a single aggregate score. They initially show the data as a tabular visualization where columns can be resized to express attribute importance. The entire visualization can then be collapsed into a stacked bar chart and sorted. Many other compensatory strategies exist: the "equal weight" (EQW) which sums alternatives without considering weights of importance <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, or the "additive difference" (ADDIF), which evaluates first each attribute across alternatives, and then weights and sums only their differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Non-compensatory strategies</head><p>Models that do not consider such tradeoffs are called non-compensatory <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. Decision makers can declare a threashold for an attribute, and drop alternatives with bad values, even if they has high values for the other attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>. One of the oldest non-compensatory strategies is the "satisficing" (SAT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>, in which the decision maker first assigns thresholds, evaluates the alternatives by order of appearance, and chooses the first that satisfies these thresholds. If no such alternative exists, the decision maker relaxes the thresholds and repeats the process, or chooses a random alternative <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. Another non-compensatory strategy is the "lexicographic" (LEX) one, where the decision maker identifies the most important attribute, and then chooses the alternative with the best value for this attribute. If more than one alternatives exist, they identify the second most important attribute and repeats <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. Finally, another non-compensatory strategy is the "elimination by aspects" (EBA) proposed by Tversky in 1972 <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref> that is very similar to the LEX, except that instead of choosing the best alternative for the most important attribute, the decision maker rejects all alternatives that do not satisfy a given threshold and repeats until only one alternative is left <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Choosing a strategy to mitigate the attraction effect</head><p>Compensatory strategies require a decision maker to consider attribute trade-offs, which people find uncomfortable to deal with <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. These negative emotions may be driven by the difficulty of calculating how much of one attribute to give up in exchange for another <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, e.g., calculating how much of prize to give up in exchange for the probability to win. In contrast, when a decoy is present near the target, these negative emotions decrease <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, presumably because people can now focus on the decoy vs. the target, a non-compensatory strategy that allows them to avoid considering tradeoffs. But the non-compensatory strategy of focusing only on the decoy and target may be a cause of the attraction effect.</p><p>Because people prefer non-compensatory strategies, we therefore chose to test one taken from the decision making literature, ELIMI-NATION BY ASPECTS (EBA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>. This strategy should allow the decision maker to minimize explicit consideration of trade-offs, in a way that avoids the attraction effect, by promoting a slower, more deliberate form of local decision-making. In EBA, the decision maker first rejects all the alternatives that do not satisfy her choice criteria to end up with the alternative of her choice. Similarly, as we explained in Sect. 3.4, a typical attraction effect choice task is divided into two subtasks: the decision maker is expected to first recognize the dominant points by rejecting the decoy(s), and, second to choose between the two trade-off choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Since the first step is often claimed to cause the bias, in DELETION experiment, we attempt to differentiate these two tasks (dominance recognition and choice) with interaction, so that the dominance recognition task does not affect the final decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Implementing the elimination by aspects (EBA)</head><p>In the EBA, unwanted alternatives are removed from a dataset. We explore how to implement this strategy in a visualization tool.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.1">Deletion in visualization</head><p>As deletion we refer to the task of removing one or more data cases from a visualized dataset. Deletion is a low-level analytic task <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> that is usually omitted from most visualization taxonomies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">95]</ref>. We consider two ways to delete data from a visualization tool:</p><p>• Filter-based deletion: A common task in visualization systems is to perform a filter-based deletion by removing data cases "based on their values concerning specific attributes" <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Filter-based deletion of data cases is a common interaction during visual analysis tasks. Consider a dataset with two data points A and B with values X A &gt; X B for a given attribute X. If a user wants to remove B as an outlier because of its high X value (e.g., to reduce clutter), she will also want to remove outlier A. This is a common filter-based deletion based on a value threshold.</p><p>• Local deletion: As local deletion we define the task of removing data cases that have been explicitly identified by the user. A local deletion of data cases is a less common interaction. In the example above, deleting only the outlier B without a link to other dataset features would likely be a source of confusion.</p><p>Although filter-based deletion and local deletion sound similar, they are not equivalent: For instance, a visualization user who wants affordable houses, can remove data cases based on their price (filter-based deletion). If she does not like the photo of a house (or due to other criteria not included in the dataset) she can also remove the specific house data case (local deletion). The filter-based deletion reflects a rule in which all data-cases that meet it are removed (e.g., all expensive houses). In local deletion, the data cases with similar or even identical house photos will not be removed as the system is not aware of the removal criteria. Most decision-support visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> allow filterbased deletion but do not support local deletion features. For example, in LineUp, the user can not directly remove a row from the table, but she can remove rows by specifying attribute filters <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.2">Deletion for mitigating the attraction effect</head><p>Both filter-based and local deletion might help reduce the attraction effect. The dominated datapoints could be removed once the user indicates a threshold of their attributes based on the target and the competitor. However, our goal is to propose an interaction that can later be used to support real-world decision tasks and help decision makers to remove irrelevant information that cannot be summarized by thresholds for dataset attributes.</p><p>Local deletion can be particularly useful in decision making. First, it is likely that a decision maker will weigh information not included in the dataset, e.g., to rule out failed solutions that she tried in the past. Moreover, even if the decision maker wants to make a decision based on information that exists in the dataset, she may not know a precise rule for the criteria. For example, the house buyer may delete a house she finds too expensive for having only one bathroom and no other particular appealing attribute. This does not imply that she wants all expensive houses with one bathroom to be removed (e.g., she could compromise with a house with other room surplus and appealing big garden). Choice preferences can evolve during exploration and are often formed progressively based on the availability of the alternatives.</p><p>In the next section, we test whether decision makers who can locally "clean up" the decision space from irrelevant information are less vulnerable to the attraction effect. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DELETION EXPERIMENT: THE INTERACTION APPROACH</head><p>In the DELETION experiment, we investigated whether altering the way visualization users interact with the data can be an effective debiasing approach.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Experiment rationale</head><p>Our method consists of an interaction of local deletions to encourage users alter their decision strategy. From decision theory (Sect. 5 ), we adopt a well-known strategy of "elimination by aspects" (EBA) in which the decision maker discards undesired alternatives in early stages of the decision process. In visualizations, this strategy can be translated to an interaction that allows users to directly delete the visualized data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Participants</head><p>203 crowdsourcing participants submitted valid responses (102 for the baseline and 101 for the deletion condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Experimental design</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.1">Stimuli and Task</head><p>In both conditions the task was the same as in the PARETO experiment: twenty choice tasks of lottery tickets each defined by a probability to win, and a prize (amount that can be won). Each choice task consisted, again, of a target, a competitor, decoys and distractors. The stimuli of both baseline and deletion conditions were identical: scatterplots with black dots representing lottery tickets (seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3)</ref>. However, the procedure that a participant had to follow in order to complete the task differed. In the baseline condition, participants directly selected their choice as in the PARETO experiment by clicking on it, and confirming their choice on a button at the bottom of the page. To undo a selection, the user could click again anywhere else apart from the confirmation button. Dots were highlighted when hovered. Hovering a dot also displayed horizontal and vertical projection lines, and the dot's X and Y values were overlaid on the axes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> In the deletion condition, participants had to first delete all the unwanted alternatives to end up with the alternative of their choice. While the mouse was pressed, a red outline was displayed around the scatterplot to indicate that the user is on deletion mode (seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7)</ref>. During deletion mode, dragging over a dot would remove it. The user could also delete dots by instantly clicking on them. The deletion area was substantially smaller than the size of the dot. This made the deletion more tedious, but it was necessary to prevent errors since some decoys were very close to the target and to each other. To undo a deletion, an "undo" button was offered to recover the deleted dots. The hovering feature was the same as in the baseline condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.2">Procedure</head><p>In the baseline condition, participants followed exactly the same procedure as in the baseline of the PARETO experiment clicking on the lottery ticket of their choice (Sect. 4.3.2).</p><p>Each participant of the deletion condition followed the same procedure as in the baseline and saw the same trials, with two differences. First, before their main choice tasks, in order to prevent accidental deletions, participants went through a deletion training and pre-test. They were given the following piece of instructions "During the tutorial 7 , you clicked on a dot to select it. You will not do this anymore. First, you have to delete the dots you do not want. The last dot you will leave will be the one you select.". Then, red and black dots appeared in the screen, instructing them to delete the red and leave only the black dots in order to proceed to the experiment. The position of the dots was carefully arranged so as not to prime users by showing a pattern similar to the attraction effect, and to also require a precise deletion of a red dot being very close to a black one. If the participant deleted by mistake a red dot, she was forced to press the undo button to redo the task from scratch. The second difference was that to choose a lottery ticket in the scatterplot, participants had to delete first all unwanted alternatives in order to select the last one left as we described in Sect. 6.3.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.3">Design</head><p>The DELETION experiment had one between-subjects factor the interaction technique (selection or deletion). As in the PARETO experiment, the positions of the target, competitor and decoys were counter-balanced within participants. In total, each participant completed 20 trials (10 pairs of matched tasks like the AC and CA in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.4">Hypothesis</head><p>The research hypothesis was:</p><p>Hr2 Following the elimination by aspects decision strategy while interacting with a scatterplot, reduces the attraction effect.</p><p>This translates into the following statistical hypothesis:</p><p>H2 The mean attraction score of the deletion condition will be smaller than the mean attraction score of the baseline condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Planned analysis results</head><p>For the baseline condition, the total number of trials were 2040 (102 participants X 20 decision tasks). For the deletion condition, we recorded a total of 2020 (101 participants X 20 decision tasks). We first report how often participants chose a dominated alternative instead of a target or competitor. For the original study <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> this value was 3.3% of the choice pairs, and in the DELETION experiment it was 3.3% for baseline, and 1.39%. for deletion. Thus error trials (choice of decoys) were as low or lower than the original experiment. The attraction score, as explained in the PARETO experiment, was based on the difference in choices made when the decoys were on prize and the choices made when the decoys were on probability. A participant whose preference for high probability or prize is independent from the position of the decoys should have attraction score close to zero.</p><p>For the baseline condition, where participants directly clicked on the ticket of their choice, the mean attraction score S baseline was 8%, with a 95% bootstrap confidence interval of [4%, 12%] (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5">Exploratory analysis of participant behavior</head><p>We performed an exploratory analysis of the interactions of the 101 participants of the deletion condition, in order to better understand if there were consistent patterns or strategies in how participants used this novel way of selecting points that might be relevant for future work. We anticipated that most participants would keep the two best options until the end of the trial, and would thus be less affected by the presence of decoys when making a decision. This behavior could potentially explain the alleviation of the attraction effect.  summarizes when participants deleted the items (target, competitor, decoy and distractor) within trials. The additional bar on the right shows the final selection (implicit selection via deleting all other datapoints). In 35% of the trials, the last point to be deleted was either the target or the competitor (N-bar). Conversely, in 65% of the trials, one or several decoys still remained on the screen when participants deleted the target or the competitor. A closer look at the data reveals that for 49% of trials, the target or the competitor are removed in the 20% last deletions (corresponding to 3-5 deletions depending on number of items in the trial). This indicates that while participants did not wait for the very last deletion to remove the target or the competitor, they still had a tendency to remove them late in the trial (i.e., in roughly half the trials 80% of the decoys had already been removed). Surprisingly, we also observed that in some trials (30%), targets and competitors were deleted early (first 20% deletions). This might suggest that in these trials participants first made a decision and then mechanically deleted datapoints, i.e., did not benefit from the technique as all decoys were still visible when they made their decision. Observation 1. In roughly half of the trials target and competitor were kept until the last 20% of a trial.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.2">How did participants use the deletion?</head><p>We anticipated that participants would remove decoys by moving closer to the target, i.e., keeping the best options last. To investigate participant spatial strategies when deleting decoys, we displayed the distance of the deleted decoys from the target as a function of trial progress (%) for each participant. Two annotators independently observed the data and both identified three strategies (DECREASE; INCREASE; OTHER) illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 10</ref>. They then independently assigned each participant to one strategy with an agreement of 0.75 (Cohen's Kappa) before resolving disagreements. As anticipated, the first strategy, DECREASE (30 occurrences), illustrated with the first participant consists of deleting decoys by moving closer to the target. In contrast, the second strategy, INCREASE (22 occurrences), is illustrated with the second participant and consists of deleting decoys by moving away from the target. In these cases users may have tried to reduce the distance between two consecutive decoys in order to decrease the cumulative selection time <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. Nevertheless, for the last group of participants, OTHER (49 occurrences), illustrated with the third participant, no tendency is visible. This OTHER strategy is less optimal from a motor control perspective. In summary, there is no strategy that clearly pops out and the anticipated one (DECREASE) is used by 30% of the participants. The data also showed that the same participant does not seem to follow the same strategy from one trial to another. While it is possible that optimising motor control, or other interaction constraints (e.g., handedness), could influence deletion strategies, the mix of strategies observed in our experiment is not enough to draw such a conclusion. Further research is needed to verify this. While this analysis could be informative, the deletion strategy that participants followed is not necessarily equivalent to their actual decision strategy. That is, we cannot speculate which decision strategy people had in mind while mechanically deleting datapoints. Observation 2. No consistent spatial pattern among participants for removing decoys.</p><p>We also investigated whether the chosen strategy influences when target and competitor are deleted and ultimately their final selection. Results suggest that participants removed target and competitor later in the trial (i.e. last 20% deletions) with DECREASE (65%) than OTHER (46%) and INCREASE (36%). However, the final impact of strategy on target and competitor selection seems not to indicate any difference: DECREASE: 51% vs. 49%; DECREASE: 49% vs. 51%; OTHER: 50% vs. 50%. These numbers are only given as an indication due to small sample size. Future work is necessary to validate these assumptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.3">Was deletion more error prone?</head><p>One possible concern is that some participants accidentally deleted the target or the competitor. Considering (i) the very low error rate of the deletion condition (1.39%, lower than the baseline condition); (ii) participants' tendency to often delete the target/competitor among last items; (iii) the small area of the deletion brush that makes multiple point deletion hard; (iv) the use of the UNDO button (mean=0.2 actions per participant; sd=0.8; max = 7), indicating that, even though they did occasionally make accidental deletions, at least in some cases they were aware of it and did correct them, we believe that accidental deletions of target or competitor were not very common. Nevertheless, another type of experimental design that captures participants' intent is needed to conclusively determine if the technique promotes accidental deletions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6">Discussion</head><p>The DELETION experiment confirms that following the elimination by aspects (EBA) decision strategy while interacting with a scatterplot reduces the attraction effect. It showed that it is possible to provide interactions that simulate well-identified decision strategies to help users make more rational decisions. This finding is especially interesting as most debiasing techniques usually require extensive training (formal courses, tutorials or video game simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, computation aid, etc.) with limited results. Local deletion led to more rational decisions (in the sense of being consistent with axioms of rational choice theory), and we speculate below on how future work might disentangle the potential reasons why.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6.1">Time and effort</head><p>In the DELETION experiment participants were asked to make a good decision rather than a fast one. Even though deleting alternatives seems to yield more rational decisions, participants spent twice as much time as those in the baseline condition. There are at least two potential reasons for the longer response times:</p><p>• Motor. The deletion condition relied on a small brush size, to avoid accidental deletions when the decoys were too close to the target, as explained in Sect. 6.3.1. The option of a larger deletion area could improve the overall task time, but it would still be impossible to compete with a direct click on a single dot or it could also lead to more undo operations.</p><p>• Cognition. There is an inevitable cost of enforcing a structured decision making strategy because decision makers need to explicitly iterate over almost all alternatives. On the other hand, the baseline condition did not enforce any strategy. So, it is possible that participants followed a strategy like (EBA) or select the first option that satisfies their needs (SAT).</p><p>While deletion was more time consuming, it is possible that the additional time, per se, had a positive effect on their reasoning, beyond the effects of deleting irrelevant values. The additional time could have allowed them to consider their choices more thoroughly. Future work might make the baseline condition equally time consuming, for example, by freezing the screen for a few minutes, to test the contribution of additional decision time, per se. On the other hand, extended wait time does not guarantee extra cognitive effort-a delay might merely frustrate or bore the user, and cause her to switch to another task</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6.2">Deletion benefits and deployment</head><p>There are more plausible explanations as to why the deletion condition led to more rational decisions. It is possible that "cleaning up" the decision space from irrelevant information helped participants to focus on the important information (in half the trials 80% of the decoys were removed when the decision was made). The process of deleting decoys may have helped them to consciously strengthen the idea that the deleted information is irrelevant or unimportant. Also, the decision strategy enforced by interactions in the deletion condition reduces the distress of comparing trade-offs between attributes, which may reduce reliance on heuristic comparisons to decoys, which in turn may reduce the attraction effect. Finally, the more tedious interaction may have enforced a more slow procedural process, going back an forth between delete actions and cognitive re-evaluation of alternatives to delete.</p><p>The purpose of enforcing point-by-point deletion was to study its effect on the attraction effect in a controlled experimental setting. How might this method be implemented in real a application? One clear strategy would be to provide flexible local deletion methods (e.g., a larger deletion area, or lasso tool) to save time. Of course, deletion tools should be optional, and not replace direct selection of the desired choice. Another consideration is how to guide users to optimize their decision process by deleting unnecessary information, while maintaining information that is important.</p><p>In the DELETION experiment we asked users to perform an otherwise easy task (only two obvious good alternatives) in a "tedious" way, which would not make sense in a real system. We generally think that wellstructured decision strategies like EBA would be practically useful for decision-support visualization systems that are meant to support more complex tasks with multiple alternatives and attributes. Such systems are encouraged to enrich their interaction palette to implement various decision strategies and help users to better manage and likely reduce the visual clutter. An example of using interactions to support a strategy is illustrated by systems such as Value Charts <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> which encourage the weighted additive strategy by allowing weight manipulations of importance and aggregation through stacked bar visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>Debiasing is often associated with educating people with extensive training or video game simulations, typically with little success. We focused instead on the system, providing the first empirical evidence that interactive visualizations can be effectively used to mitigate cognitive biases. In our displays, the attraction effect stems from an inappropriate weighting of decoy objects, and a rational decision maker should only consider points within the Pareto front. We found that a non-interactive approach, the highlighted Pareto front, led to weak evidence for a drop in the attraction effect, presumably by helping the participant ignore the biasing information. Forcing the user to interact and progressively delete suboptimal points led to a strong drop, by explicitly removing the biasing information from the display.</p><p>Together, the PARETO and DELETION experiments suggest two methods that may help reduce biases in decision making within data visualizations: computational aids that highlight optimal decisions based on objective criteria, but more counterintuitively, a system where users can systematically delete information as they make comparative decisions at a more local level of analysis.</p><p>At first glance, removing information from a display appears to be an extreme solution, because the power of visualizations is that they allow us to process massive amounts of data at once -why lose information and context? Yet the attraction effect is an example of how this context can mislead. And visualizations already constantly omit information, with lower-dimensional views of complex datasets, parameter slides, and other focusing techniques. Why not allow users to remove information by hand, instead of only with automated processes? Visualizations are tools for information management, and this type of by-hand management might benefit a wider variety of visualizations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Possible techniques to mitigate the attraction effect in scatterplots: remove the dominated points (A), indicate visually the Pareto front (B).</figDesc></figure>
