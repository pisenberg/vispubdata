			<abstract>
				<p>The diverse and vibrant ecosystem of interactive visualizations on the web presents an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to observe and analyze how everyday people interact with data visualizations. However, existing metrics of visualization interaction behavior used in research do not fully reveal the breadth of peoples&apos; open-ended explorations with visualizations. One possible way to address this challenge is to determine high-level goals for visualization interaction metrics, and infer corresponding features from user interaction data that characterize different aspects of peoples&apos; explorations of visualizations. In this paper, we identify needs for visualization behavior measurement, and develop corresponding candidate features that can be inferred from users&apos; interaction data. We then propose metrics that capture novel aspects of peoples&apos; open-ended explorations, including exploration uniqueness and exploration pacing. We evaluate these metrics along with four other metrics recently proposed in visualization literature by applying them to interaction data from prior visualization studies. The results of these evaluations suggest that these new metrics 1) reveal new characteristics of peoples&apos; use of visualizations, 2) can be used to evaluate statistical differences between visualization designs, and 3) are statistically independent of prior metrics used in visualization research. We discuss implications of these results for future studies, including the potential for applying these metrics in visualization interaction analysis, as well as emerging challenges in developing and selecting metrics depicting visualization explorations.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>As interactive visualizations migrate from standalone applications to the web, visualization users have expanded from domain experts to the general population. Alongside this expansion of both visualization creators and consumers comes an expansion in the goals of bothfrom casual exploration to focused analysis. But do the metrics we use to assess visualizations capture this diversity in objectives? In this paper, we explore how the rapid development of expressive and interactive forms on the web has demanded an extension of the metric toolbox in which we equip content creators, and how we can better align assessment with the goals of the designers.</p><p>Consider an example where someone explores an interactive scatterplot visualization showing a company's profit and income. Each point represents a company, and upon mousing over a point the user will uncover the company's income over several years, the employees' age distribution, etc. A person's goals can be diverse here, ranging from specific (gathering information on a possible stock purchase) to broad (getting to know more companies). Two likely metrics to describe their behavior include time spent on exploration and points interacted with. These metrics could be used to answer basic questions about how an audience uses a published visualization, for example "how many points did the average person interact with?" or "how long did the average person explore the visualization?". Yet despite their diversity in goals, it's possible that users interact with a similar number of points and engage with the visualization for a similar amount of time. While simple metrics might not reveal differences between users, in reality, their behavior may not align with what the creator of the visualization had in mind for their audience.</p><p>Although research has made strides in designing and evaluating interaction in visualization, we lack low-barrier, expressive metrics that capture the breadth of user interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Various analysis strategies have been used to answer these questions, including statistical and visual approaches (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>). However, these existing approaches have limitations with characterizing user explorations precisely. Many of the metrics used to summarize activity tend to overaggregate behavior, failing to identify differences between users, or by failing to capture detailed information such as how long has been spent on which visual elements. On the other hand, the visual approaches usually keep the details of users' interaction logs, but visual inspections can hardly lead to reliable inferences.</p><p>One possible way to bridge this gap is to develop metrics, i.e., statistical measures, which take into account more information in peoples' interaction logs, and to better reveal facets of peoples' explorations. Related efforts can be found in the field of HCI. Chi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> quantified the saliency of a user's visit to a website when modeling users' information needs and actions on the web. Heer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> further used this measure to cluster web users. These efforts influence our work of visualization interaction analysis, in that a user's open-ended exploration of a visualization containing visual elements can be considered analogous to the exploration of a website. However, it is impractical to directly adapt these methods developed to analyze website explorations, due to the differences between the website clickstream analysis and visualization interaction analysis, such as different scales (i.e., usually millions of users versus tens to thousands of users) and different complexity of interaction types.</p><p>The aims of this paper are three-fold:</p><p>1. Derive a requirements space to categorize existing and new metrics that quantify facets of users' exploration of data visualization and in doing so identify emerging analysis needs. 2. Derive two new metrics centered around user exploration diversity and pacing that provide new perspectives into users' openended exploration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Evaluate both these new metrics and metrics recently proposed</head><p>in visualization literature across hundreds of interaction traces from previously published visualization experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</p><p>We further discuss how these metrics can help both statistical and visual approaches to analyze interaction logs, such as 1) quantifying the impact of visualization designs on user behavior; 2) organizing the visual representation of interaction logs; and 3) serving as features to machine learning models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BACKGROUND</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Characterizing Website Exploration</head><p>One closely related thread of research is clickstream analysis and visualization for websites or applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>, under a broader research topic of event sequence analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. Clickstream research includes the data processing, analysis and visualization methods to analyze users' website visit logs. For example, Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> developed algorithms to extract sequence patterns from clickstreams. Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> created a visualization called Ma-trixWave to compare two clickstream datasets, and found it to scale better than commonly used Sankey diagrams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Characterizing Visualization Explorations</head><p>Characterizing user behavior through interaction logs has been used for various purposes, such as learning user characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, understanding system usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and the reasoning process <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and evaluating visualization design <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Visual Approaches</head><p>Visual approaches refer to strategies of showing users' interaction logs with visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. The interaction logs can be shown in an aggregated way in order to reveal the behavioral differences of user groups in experiment analyses. For example, Ottley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> used aggregated maps to show different exploration patterns of tree visualizations. Users' interaction logs can also be shown individually. Blascheck et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> introduced a visual analytic approach to study users' interactions with visual analytics. These visual approaches have the advantage of preserving the details of the interaction logs. However, visual examination alone cannot provide robust analyses of user behavior, as they are often better paired statistical approaches. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Statistical Approaches</head><p>Commonly used metrics to depict a user's exploration include total exploration time spent by a user, and number of raw interactions performed by a user during exploration, such as hovering and clicking. Boy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> evaluated the effectiveness of storytelling by comparing users' exploration time and raw interaction counts (hovers and clicks) between the experimental and control groups. Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> measured the effects of latency on users' exploration behavior of visual analytics by using raw interaction counts (drag, brushing and linking, etc). There are many other works using the basic metrics to characterize users' interaction with visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p><p>However, these raw counts have limitations with delivering semantic meanings of user explorations. Interaction coding was thus used to describe interaction behavior. Boy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and Guo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> coded the raw interactions into semantic interactions, such as selecting, filtering and inspecting, according to Yi et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> visualization interaction framework. They counted the coded interactions afterwards.</p><p>Some work went beyond counting individual interactions (including raw and semantic ones), in order to reveal more characteristics of user explorations. Guo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> further extracted the sub-sequences containing specific individual interactions, and then counted the subsequences for each user. Wall et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> proposed six metrics to measure cognitive bias, including data coverage, data distribution and attribute coverage/distribution, etc.</p><p>In this work we create a feature space to categorize the existing metrics, and develop new metrics by filling the gaps in the framework, by fully utilizing the information in interaction sequences, in order to reveal more characteristics of users' visualization explorations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">A REQUIREMENTS SPACE FOR METRIC DEVELOPMENT</head><p>The aim of this work is to explore and evaluate metrics that characterize the diversity of peoples' explorations with interactive visualizations on the web. We therefore situate our metric development activities by deriving a set of requirements (top-down) and examining the possible common data sources (bottom-up) from which new metrics can be derived, which translate into two questions:</p><p>1. What do we need to measure for behavior analysis?</p><p>2. What can we measure given users' interaction logs? These questions drive two dimensions in this requirements space: 1) identifying unfilled measuring needs for visualization behavior analysis, and 2) deriving low-level measurable features from visualization interaction logs (Section 3.1 and 3.2).</p><p>We form the structure of this requirements space based on O'Connell et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> framework for deriving metrics measuring human interaction with interactive visualizations. In their framework, high-level needs include human-interaction heuristics, i.e., measures that assess how well visualizations empower analysis, collaboration, ease of use, etc. O'Connell et al. then derive corresponding metrics for each of the heuristics by utilizing features from users' interaction data such as number of interactions performed by a user.</p><p>One aim of this work is to move beyond system-specific visualization interaction metrics towards metrics that can be applied across a range of visualizations and for a range of creator goals, whether they be visualization practitioners or researchers. Our requirements space therefore expands and generalizes O'Connell et al.'s metric framework in two ways. First, centered on needs of visualization creators, we identify desirable avenues for visualization interaction metric development. Second, by examining commonly available interaction data in web-based visualizations we derive novel features which are intended to enable new means for comparison and reasoning about how audiences interact with visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Visualization Interaction Analysis: Identifying Needs</head><p>What are unfilled needs in visualization interaction analysis?</p><p>Researchers and practitioners often develop metrics to capture various dimensions of user experience. While there is currently no widely used metrics framework targeting visualization activity, we might consider frameworks developed in human-computer interaction as a starting point. Consider the HEART metrics framework for web applications proposed by Rodden et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. In the context of evaluating web applications, Rodden et al. define five categories: happiness, engagement, adoption, retention, and task success. This framework, while not originally intended for visualization, can be used to some extent to categorize existing efforts in developing metrics for interactive visualizations. For example, some existing metrics aim to reveal users' task success. Time spent on exploration has been used as an indicator of how efficiently a task is performed by the user <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. Targeting bias, Wall et al.'s metrics aim to capture the quality of exploration in visual analytics contexts. Other metrics target proxies of engagement with visualizations. For example, interaction coverage metrics have been explored in several recent works, typically targeting numbers of specific types of interaction events (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>).</p><p>The complexity of interactive visualization makes it difficult to develop metrics that fulfill all dimensions of measurement needs, especially by only adapting metrics from web applications. Challenges surrounding metrics development are especially salient given the question of measuring user "engagement" in visualizations, which indicates users' willingness to invest effort to explore further and gain more information from the visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. For example, longer exploration may indicate engagement, but may also be reflective of confusion and difficulties faced by a user learning a new interaction scheme. Similarly, an increase in interaction counts could either reflect users' interest or possibly their random clicks to orient themselves in a new environment. Given these ambiguities, one aim of this paper is to explore new formulations and perspectives on metrics that may serve as useful proxies for capturing part of the user experiences of an interactive visualization.</p><p>In this paper, we seek new metrics to reveal more aspects of user engagement with visualizations. The next section (3.2) deals with how to enumerate these metrics given users' interaction data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Deriving Features from Visualization Interaction Data</head><p>What can we measure from peoples' visualization interaction data?</p><p>Working from the bottom-up, we observe that multiple candidate low-level features can be extracted from peoples' visualization interaction data.

Similarly, Blascheck et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> point out that the time spent for inspecting particular data items is a widely available and useful feature to be considered in evaluating user behavior. Based on the existing literature of visualization interaction analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, visualization interaction frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, and the related topic of website clickstream analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, we list several low-level interaction features that can commonly be obtained from a user's exploration session of visualizations encountered on the web (see <ref type="table">Table  1</ref> for precise descriptions using mathematical notations):</p><p>• type: What type of interaction is it (e.g. selection, hovering, or the types from existing frameworks such as Yi et al. facets of the visualization? We list several metrics characterizing users' visualization explorations and identify the underused features. There are several basic metrics that are commonly used by researchers and practitioners. We simplify the description of the metrics by assuming that there is only one type of interaction in the visualization:</p><p>• number-of-actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>: equals to k, the number of certain type of interactions performed by the user during exploration. • number-of-visited-elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>: equals to |E(u)|, the number of unique visualization elements visited by the user. A visit is defined as a meaningful (i.e. non-accidental) interaction with an element, which lasts for at least a short amount of time (e.g., 500ms) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</p><p>• exploration-time <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>: equals to t end − t start , the time spent by the user on the exploration. A recent study in the visual analytics area from Wall et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> propose metrics to measure bias in visualization exploration, by using multiple features from users' interaction data.</p><p>bias-data-point-coverage measures bias based on the user's coverage of the data points in the visualization. Since one data point is often mapped to one element in the visualization, in this paper, a data point is considered equivalent to a visual element.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">b DC = 1 − min( |E(u)| κ(E(u))<label>, 1)</label></formula><p>where |E(u)| denotes the number of unique visualization elements interacted by the user, andκ(E(u)) denotes the expected value of the number of unique elements visited in k interactions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">κ(E(u)) = N k − (N − 1) k N k−1</formula><p>Another metric Wall et al. propose is bias-data-point-distribution, measuring bias toward repeated interactions with individual data points or subsets of the data.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">b DD = 1 − p</formula><p>where p is the p-value obtained from the χ 2 distribution with N -1 degrees of freedom</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">χ 2 = N ∑ n=1 (C(u, e n ) −Ĉ(u, e n )) 2 C(u, e n ) whereĈ(u, e n ) = [k/N].</formula><p>Among the existing metrics, we observe that the basic metrics (e.g., number-of-visited-elements) reveal the end results of the exploration process, meaning that the details in the process (e.g., elements and duration of each interactions) are not preserved in the metrics. Wall et al.'s bias metrics go beyond traditional methods by distinguishing the element of each interaction in the exploration process. However, we still observe that some other features revealing details are underused by existing metrics, e.g., duration and moment of interaction. Examining the existing metrics such as visits and exploration time in light of these recent studies raise new questions about user exploration in visualizations. For example, instead of how many elements are visited in the visualization, what about the diversity of elements visited? And instead of how much time is spent in exploration, what about the pacing of peoples' exploration inside visualizations?</p><p>Given both the unfilled needs of measurement and underused features in users' interaction data, we propose two additional metrics that take into amount more features, and thus offer new perspectives user engagement, i.e., the diversity and pacing of peoples' open-ended explorations with interactive visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">PROPOSED METRICS 4.1 Exploration Uniqueness</head><p>The exploration-uniqueness (EU) metric aims to capture the diverse engagement of peoples' open-ended explorations, i.e., to quantify how unique a user's exploration pattern is compared to patterns from others. The EU metric is defined as aggregated visit duration over visual elements, weighted by the uniqueness in comparison to the crowd. A low EU value suggests that a user's time distributed visiting the visual elements align with common patterns of exploration in the visualization. A high EU value suggests that a user's exploration strategy differentiates itself from most other users.</p><p>Measurable features: There are many ways to define a unique exploration pattern, e.g., visiting a set of unique elements, or visiting elements in an unique order. This metric characterizes the uniqueness of a user's visited element sets, instead of visit orders. In open-ended explorations, visit orders may carry too much variance, obscuring the trends of unique explorations. We thus compute uniqueness based on the distribution of time spent visiting the data items in the visualization. The features from users' interaction logs (Section 3.2) taken into account are the elements and duration of interaction, i.e., the order of interaction and exploration time are discarded.</p><p>Modeling approach: As we develop the metric, we model the interaction behavior of a group of users as a matrix (Equation (2)), where each row represents a user, and each column represents an element in the visualization. An alternative approach is to model each user's interaction sequence as a Markov chain, which is used in Wall et al.'s bias metrics. Each interaction with a visual element is a state in a state space. A user performing the {element, interaction} combination has transitioned to the associated state in the Markov chain. We adopt matrix to model interactions for the EUmetric mainly for two reasons. First, a user's behavior is represented as a vector, instead of a sequence. This representation aligns with the selection of features, i.e., focus on the data distribution, rather than the visit order. Second, matrix enables comparisons across users, i.e., each user's behavior can be compared to the crowd.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Adapting the Concept of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)</head><p>In order to depict the uniqueness of a users' exploration process, we need to know how unique each of her visit is, compared to other users' visits. From the field of information retrieval, we find one adaptable concept, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), describing how unique a word is in a document collection. The uniqueness of the appearance of a word in a document is the product of TF and IDF. Term frequency (TF) is the frequency of the word in a particular document. Inverse document frequency (IDF) is the inverse proportion of documents the word appears in. IDF acts as a weight to TF, rewarding the words appear in less documents, and penalizing those appear in more documents. For example, a and the tend to have lower IDF than house. Given a document collection D, a word w, and an individual document d ∈ D, we calculate a TF-IDF value for each word in a document:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">T FIDF(w, d) = T F × IDF = f (w, d) |d| × log( |D| f (w, D) )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where f (w, d), equals the number of times w appears in d, |d| is the number of words in d, |D| is the size of the corpus, and f (w, D), equals the number of documents in which w appears in D <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. In several research initiatives, TF-IDF has been extended from characterizing words to modeling user behavior. For example, In the field of HCI, TF-IDF has been used to describe the uniqueness of peoples' visits to a website <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, and peoples' geospatial movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Herein we adapt TF-IDF to calculate the uniqueness of a user's visit to an element in a visualization. Specifically, we map a user's interaction log to a document, each visit of a visual element to a word in the document, and a collection of exploration sessions of multiple users to a corpus. A visual element visited by more users has a higher IDF value than an element visited by fewer users.</p></div>

There are two alternative options, 1) to use the count of visits from a user to an element C(u m , e n ), divided by the total number of visits from the user to all the elements, and 2) to use the binary value {1, 0} to mark a user's visit to an element (1 if visited, 0 if not visited), and then divide it by the total number of elements visited by the user. We choose the time option over the other two to minimize noise, i.e., during openended explorations, a user might accidentally interact with an element, and aggregating the time spent by the user on the element can better indicate the user's intentional visit to the element.</p><p>Step 3: Aggregate the uniqueness scores Uniq for each user u m .</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Uniq(u m ) = N ∑ n=1 T FIDF(u m , e n )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where T FIDF(u m , e n ) is the TF-IDF value calculated for each visit from a user u m to a visual element e n , using Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">3</ref>. By aggregating the TF-IDF values of the visits from one user to all the visual elements, we get a metric depicting the overall uniqueness of the user's exploration. This aggregation process can omit the variation of the TF-IDF distribution, i.e., a user having only one visit with extremely high TF-IDF value may have the same uniqueness metric value as another user having many visits with low TF-IDF values. But the aggregation has at least two advantages. First, it enables the comparison among any users in a group. Before aggregation, each user's interaction behavior is modeled as a vector. A vector supports pairwise comparison between two users, which can be very useful under some circumstances (see Section 6.1). However, it does not support comparison among more than two users. The aggregated metric, instead, supports comparison between subgroups containing any number of users, which is useful for evaluating alternative visualization designs through user interaction. Second, a sum-based aggregation preserves all the unique visits during a user's exploration, i.e., if a user has visited any rarely-visited element, it will be preserved in the final metric. Considering an alternative aggregation approach -averaging the uniqueness of a user's visits by the visited elements, if a user has visited lots of frequently-visited elements and one rarely-visited element, the latter will be averaged out after aggregation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Exploration Pacing</head><p>The pacing metric aims to differentiate temporal strategies by users. Given that the temporal features, e.g., duration and moment of interactions, are underused by existing metrics, we seek metrics that can utilize them and reveal peoples' diverse exploration patterns. The temporal information from a user's exploration process can be viewed as time-series signal, with the moments "visiting any element" marked as non-zero values, and the other moments marked as zeros.</p><p>In fields related to signal processing, e.g., image and audio processing, people extract features not only from the temporal aspect, but also the frequency aspect of the signal, e.g., the high-frequency parts of an audio piece. Similarly, the frequency-related information may also carry users' exploration characteristics. While users may visit the same set of visualization elements and spend same amount of time on exploration, the duration and frequency of those visits may be different, and thus may reflect different exploration strategies. By characterizing these differences with exploration-pacing, we may begin to quantify another aspect of user engagement with a visualization. A time-series sequence representing a user's exploration session: <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>: A user's exploration interactions can be transformed into a time-series signal with {0, 1} representing her visiting status. (Time used to visit an element is marked as gray.) The signal sequence can further be transformed to a 2D wavelet power spectrum through continuous wavelet transform.</p><p>The exploration-pacing (EP) derived in this section is defined as the density of a user's high-frequency visits to the visual elements during exploration. A higher EP value suggests a user that rapidly moves from item to item. A lower value might reflect a user that explore individual elements for more time.</p><p>Measurable features: We compute the pacing metric based on the distribution of a users' interaction frequency. The features related to time from users' interaction logs (Section 3.2) to calculate the metric, i.e., the moments and duration of interaction, and exploration time. We discard the other less relevant features, e.g., elements.</p><p>Transform approach: One essential step to develop the metric is to select a function to transform a user's visit sequence over time to a visit-frequency sequence. One key intuition here is that merely averaging or binning time durations of a user's interaction with visual elements is insufficient for developing a single metric, as in-depth interactions will be dominated by multiple shorter-duration interactions. Instead, we observe that common mathematical techniques, e.g., the wavelet transform, can readily transform duration data from the time domain to the frequency domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Adapting the Concept of Continuous Wavelet Transform</head><p>The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is often used for extracting the frequency information from a time-series signal by conducting a convolution of the signal with a wavelet function <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The CWT of a function x(t) at a scale s (s &gt; 0, s ∈ R + * ) and translational value τ ∈ R is expressed by Equation <ref type="formula">5</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Wave w (s, τ) = 1 √ s ∞ −∞ x (t) ψ( t − τ s )dt (5)</formula><p>where ψ(t) is the mother wavelet, a continuous function in both the time domain and the frequency domain, and the over-line represents operation of complex conjugate. The power of CWT has an interpretation as time-frequency wavelet energy density called the wavelet power spectrum (Equation 6). This coefficient can be used to indicate the energy distribution of every moment in a user's exploration, e.g., a moment with higher power values on high-frequency ranges indicate rapid visits to visual elements.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Power(s, τ) = 1 s |Wave w (s, τ)| 2<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Compared to the traditional short-time Fourier transform (STFT), CWT can also construct a time-frequency representation of a signal that offers reliable time and frequency localization. This property makes it better at extracting frequency features from the non-periodic time-series user interaction sequences. Thus we adapt CWT to automatically detect the frequency distribution of a user's visualization exploration over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Metric Calculation Steps</head><p>The exploration-pacing metric is computed in three steps.</p><p>Step 1: For each user, form a time-series sequence S(t), representing the user's visiting status over time, from a user's exploration interaction sequence Ex(u). S(t) contains a sequence of values of {0, 1} over time, sampled from a user's exploration process. If at moment t, the user is visiting an element, then it is marked as 1; otherwise if the user is not visiting any element, it is marked as 0. We sample the data every 0.1 second. If a user visited an element for one second at the beginning of her exploration, then the sequence S = <ref type="figure">(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0,</ref> ...).</p><p>Step 2: Apply continuous wavelet transform to the sequence S(t) to obtain a 2D time-frequency wavelet power spectrum. We use the R package "WaveletComp" <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, which computes CWT and obtain a wavelet power spectrum <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>) according to Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. The Morlet wavelet is used as the mother wavelet for the convolution.</p><p>Step 3: Obtain the metric value Pacing HF by computing the average power over time and a high-frequency range [ f min , f max ].</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Pacing HF = 1 ( f max − f min )(t end − t start ) f max ∑ f = f min t end ∑ t=t start Power(t, f ) (7)</formula><p>where t start and t end denote the start and end moments of a user's exploration session.</p><p>We use 1/32 Hz and 1/8 Hz as the minimum and maximum bounds for the high-frequency range to compute the metric. Given that the sampling rate we use is once per 0.1 second, the high-frequency range corresponds to a period range of 0.8 and 3.2 seconds. This range aims to generally align with high-frequency (i.e., rapid) visit behavior, and to mitigate possible accidental interactions, but can vary depending on visualization design. Precise modeling and parameters given visualization type and user behavior may be a valuable route for future work. For example, the range parameter can be changed to extract users' power density for other frequencies (e.g., low frequency).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Interaction Data from Two Studies</head><p>We evaluate the two proposed metrics by applying them, together with other four metrics used in visualization literature, to interaction data collected from two previous studies from Feng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. Search-inVis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> studied the effects of adding text-based search functionality to interactive visualizations on the web. Search enables a user to highlight elements in the visualization by typing keywords in a search box. HindSight <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> studied the effects of directly encoding people's personal interaction history in visualizations. During a user's exploration, visual elements the user interacts with are visually augmented to appear distinct from unexplored elements. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows visualizations from these studies whose data was adapted for the present work.</p><p>Participants and Conditions: Both studies include multiple experiments, one for each study-visualization pair, e.g., SearchinVis-255Charts. All experiments had a between-subjects design, conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Every participant was randomly assigned to interact with either the original or augmented version of a visualization. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the participant numbers of the control and experimental groups in each experiment.</p><p>Task and Procedure: Each participant was asked to analyze the visualization for as long as they liked before answering questions. The authors used an open-ended exploration task in order to simulate people's real-world explorations of web visualizations. Each participant went through several phases, including introduction, exploration, and insight/strategy. In the introduction phase, the participant was given instructions to interact with the visualization in any way they saw fit. Afterwards, the participant entered the exploration phase, where they could interact with the visualization without time limit. When the participant finished exploring, they entered the insight/strategy phase, where they answer questions about their findings aimed at highlighting possible differences in the control and experiment conditions.</p><p>Interaction Data: During the exploration phase, each participant's interactions with visual elements were recorded as Ex(u) = The elements interacted by the user appear differently than the rest. <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>: Four experiment datasets from two previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> were used for the metric evaluation: SearchinVis-255Charts, SearchinVis-Boardrooms, HindSight-255Charts and HindSifght-Metafilter. Each dataset includes the interaction data of two groups of participants. Each group interacted with either the original or the augmented visualization.  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Number of participants in 4 experiments in the previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studies</head><p>(t start , I 1 , ..., I k ,t end ), where t start and t end are the start and end time of the exploration phase, and I i (0 ≤ i ≤ k) denotes every interaction <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. Each interaction was recorded as I = (t, a, E i , d), where t is the start moment of the interaction, a is the interaction type (hovering), E i is the set of interacted elements (there is one and only one element affected by each interaction), and d is the duration of the interaction. Specifically, we select from these studies visualizations that were adapted from published visualizations on the web, including 255Charts and Boardrooms from the SearchinVis study, and 255Charts and Meta f ilter from HindSight. We exclude the remaining visualizations in these studies in the present analysis, such as a bubble chart of exoplanet data (i.e., condition 5 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>), because they were designed to test specific hypotheses in the prior studies, such as the effects of dataset familiarity and search behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Applying Interaction Metrics: Case Studies</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Can the proposed metrics reveal new characteristics of people's interaction with visualizations?</head><p>To evaluate the extent to which the proposed metric explorationuniqueness(EU) shows different exploration patterns, we examine several individual exploration sessions in which users visited the same number of visual elements (NVE), but varied on the EU values. Then we visually examine whether an exploration with a higher metric value includes more elements rarely-visited by others.</p><p>In order to distinguish frequently-and rarely-visited elements, we calculate the percentage of visits for each element, and plot it as a baseline map <ref type="figure">(Figure 3)</ref>, where each circle represents a visual element, and its opacity mapped to the percentage of users who visited it. From the baseline maps of both SearchinVis-255Charts and HindSight-255Charts, visual inspection suggests that the elements at the periphery of the visualization are frequently visited, while the elements in the middle are rarely visited.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, user A, B and C from SearchinVis-255Charts visited the same number of elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> during their explorations. However, these explorations vary at EU, i.e., A's is the lower (0.9), B's is the medium (1.4), and C's is the higher (2.0). For each of them, we plot all visited elements on top of the baseline map, where each circle represents a visit, with its size corresponding to how long the user spent visiting this element. Visually comparing the visit maps from the user A, B and C, we find that the elements visited by A (lower EU) are mostly at the periphery of the visualization, which are frequently visited by other users, according to the baseline map. In-stead, user C (higher EU) visited more elements located at the lowermiddle part of the visualization, which are rarely visited by other users in the study. The elements visited by user B (middle EU) include some frequently-visited and some rarely-visited elements.</p><p>Similarly, user G, H and I from HindSight-255Charts visited the same number of elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> with varying EU, i.e., G's is the lower (0.7), H's is the medium (1.2), and I's is the higher (1.7). By visually comparing the visit maps from G, H and I, we see that the elements visited by G (lower EU) are mostly at the periphery of the visualization (i.e., frequently-visited elements). User I (higher EU) visited more elements at the middle part of the visualization, which are rarely visited by other users in the study. The elements visited by user H (middle EU) include both frequently-visited and rarely-visited elements.</p><p>We also find that exploration-pacing (EP) can reveal differences in the pacing of user explorations. Specifically, we examine the individual cases from SearchinVis (user D, E, F) and HindSight (user J, K, L). Each of these users explored the visualization for similar amount of time, but with lower, medium or higher paces. User D, for example, appears to intersperse rapidly-paced interactions with longer interactions. User F, in contrast, spends nearly all of their time performing rapid exploration. These cases illustrate that the pacing metric can aid in distinguishing between the temporal behavior of users, essentially by transforming the temporal observations to the frequency space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Metrics for Experiment Analyses</head><p>Can the metrics provide additional insight in experiment analyses?</p><p>After examining individual cases to check the validity of the proposed metrics, we explore their effectiveness on one of the potential application scenarios, i.e., to show the impact of visualization designs on user interaction behavior. Specifically, we compare the metric values between two user groups (experimental and control) in each study by applying the same statistical tests as in the original studies. We also evaluate four other metrics proposed or used in visualization literature, number-of-visited-elements, exploration-time, bias-data-pointcoverage, and bias-data-point-distribution.</p><p>Following the statistical methods used in the previous studies, we compute 95% confidence intervals using the bootstrap method, and effect sizes using Cohen's d -which is the difference in means of the conditions divided by the pooled standard deviation. We also use the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test to compare different user groups.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Group</head><p>Control Group <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>: We applied the proposed pacing and uniqueness to two previous studies, with results suggesting that they capture different facets of user explorations of visualizations on the web. Importantly, these metrics align with and quantify the findings and intuitions of that study. The addition of search to 255Charts encouraged more diverse spatial patterns of exploration, while also nudging users to look more in-depth at specific visual elements.</p><p>Boardrooms: We filtered out 11 (from 96) users who did not interact with any visual element. We found significant differences on the exploration-time and bias-data-point-distribution between the two user groups. Specifically, the experimental group spent longer time on average (M=405 95% CI [337, 480]) in seconds than the control group <ref type="figure">(M=290 95% CI [234, 368]</ref>). The Mann-Whitney test shows that W = 598, p = 0.007, and the effect size is d = 0.51 [0.05, 0.96]. This difference has been reported in the previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> In summary, by applying the existing and proposed metrics to two experiments in the study, we found that our proposed metrics appear to provide additional insight in experiment analyses that could have appeared in previous published work, i.e., by quantifying the impact of text-based search functionality on the uniqueness or "diversity" of user explorations. At the same time, we find that in Feng et al.'s textbased search study, the presence of the search functionality appears to have a different impact on user behavior when added to the 255Charts and Boardrooms visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">Study 2: HindSight</head><p>We apply existing and proposed metrics to the interaction data from the two experiments of the study HindSight <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, which includes 255Charts, a visualization from The New York Times, and a comparatively simpler Metafilter visualization stimuli. The aim here is to examine the behavioral impact of the direct encoding of personal interaction history, by comparing the two user groups in each experiment.</p><p>255Charts: We filtered out one (from 116) user who did not interact with any visual elements. We found significant differences on the metric number-of-visited-elements and exploration-uniqueness between the two user groups, while the other metrics are similar between groups. Specifically, the experimental group visited more visual elements on average (M=28 95% CI <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>) than the control group (M=21 95% CI <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>). The Mann-Whitney test shows that W = 1392.5, p = 0.11, and the effect size is d = 0.41 [0.07, 0.73]. This difference has been reported in the previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The experimental group has a higher exploration-uniqueness on average (M=1. Metafilter: We found significant differences on the metric number-of-visited-elements, bias-data-point-coverage, bias-datapoint-distribution, exploration-uniqueness between the two user groups, while the other metrics are similar between groups.

The experimental group also has a higher exploration-uniqueness on average (M=0. In summary, by applying the existing and proposed metrics to two experiments in the study HindSight, we found that our proposed metrics can provide additional insight in experiment analyses, i.e., uncover the impact of direct encoding of personal interaction history on the uniqueness of user explorations. We also find that the HindSight technique has a different impact on user behavior, specifically, users' bias levels, when added to the real-world and less complex visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Metric Correlation and Independence</head><p>Are the metrics correlated or independent when applied to real data?</p><p>We compute correlations between each pair of the metrics across all experimental datasets <ref type="figure">(Figure 3)</ref>, SearchinVis-255Charts, SearchinVis-Boardrooms, HindSight-255Charts and HindSight-Metafilter. We expect that the metrics measuring different high-level aspects of user explorations are independent from each other.</p><p>We found strong and moderate correlations, r = [0.5, 1), between the metric bias-data-point-coverage and bias-data-point-distribution. Specifically, they are strongly correlated in SearchinVis-255Charts (r = 0.72, p &lt; 0.001) and HindSight-Metafilter (r = 0.76, p &lt; 0.001), and moderately correlated in HindSight-255Charts (r = 0.67, p &lt; 0.001) and SearchinVis-Boardrooms (r = 0.61, p &lt; 0.001). This indicates that for these cases, the two metrics play similar roles characterizing exploration behavior.</p><p>We also found a moderate correlation, r = [0.5, 0.7), between number-of-visited-elements and exploration-time, in SearchinVis-255Charts (r = 0.57, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Both exploration-uniqueness and exploration-uniqueness have weak correlations or less with the other metrics across all the datasets. These results suggest that the proposed metrics carry different information than the others when applied to user exploration data. However, we note that linear correlation is just one of many possible measures of dependence, and further analyses with larger datasets may be necessary to make definitive claims.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DISCUSSION</head><p>The proposed uniqueness and pacing metrics aim to reveal new facets of how people interact with visualizations. To examine this claim, we applied the proposed metrics, together with metrics from prior work, to interaction data from prior information visualization studies. The results suggest that, first, the proposed metrics do reveal new characteristics of peoples' exploration behavior in visualizations. Second, the proposed metrics can be used as target metrics in comparative experiments, i.e., quantitative analysis comparing control and treatment groups. Third, the proposed metrics are also generally independent of prior metrics used in visualization research, as indicated by the correlation analysis, implying that they may be a source of new information for exploratory visualization design and research.</p><p>In the analysis of the study SearchinVis, we found that the results differ for 255Charts and Boardrooms. The metric values of exploration-uniqueness and exploration-pacing are significantly different between groups in 255Charts while in Boardrooms they are similar. One possible explanation is that the Boardroom visualization is in a storytelling form with multiple types of interaction. Larger interaction sets, then, may pose new challenges and opportunities for measures of interaction behavior.</p><p>We also found that in the experiment HindSight-Metafilter, the experimental user group has higher values in the bias metrics on average than the control group. By further examining the interaction logs, we found that a higher value in the bias metric is contributed by the revisits to previously-visited visual elements. On the other hand, the users in the experimental group visited more charts on average than those in the control group, in the whole exploration process. The proposed metrics thus lead to new questions, such as how much bias measures should weight revisits against the breadth of peoples' exploration?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Potential Applications of Interaction Metrics</head><p>New and newly evaluated metrics for visualization interaction analysis may open several opportunities in visualization research.</p><p>As metrics to quantify the impact of visualization designs. One goal of researchers and practitioners is to examine the comparative impact of competing techniques on user behavior. However, users' openended explorations of visualizations can be complex, as described in Section 3, and cannot be adequately summarized into number of actions taken or total time spent on exploration, which are the basic metrics commonly used in previous evaluations, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. Instead, we have shown that from these low-level user interaction components we can develop metrics that provide new perspectives into users' openended explorations, which may allow us to better assess the impact of a given visualization or interaction technique on user behavior.</p><p>As proxies to infer user characteristics and reasoning processes. Behavioral patterns of exploration can be used to infer users' characteristics (e.g., locus of control <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>), reasoning processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and insight generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. By providing new ways to characterize users' exploration behavior, we could possibly explore new avenues of individual differences in visualization use and preference.</p><p>As attributes to visualize users' interaction logs. One advantage of visualization approaches for analyzing interaction data is that detailed information can be logged during user interaction, as shown in previous works that center on visualizing interaction logs e.g., Blascheck et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. One limitation of this approach is that it relies primarily on expert analysts to visually identify trends across user interaction traces. Fortunately, recent work has begun to explore automatic approaches to assist in navigating interaction traces, such as sequence search and extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. We contend that new metrics can also aid in this direction of research, by serving as relatively lowbarrier features that could be encoded in interaction log visualization, for example ordering or coloring by uniqueness, bias, or pacing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>As features to support machine learning algorithms. Machine learning techniques have also been used to analyze users' interactions with visualizations, e.g., to classify user characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, to extract interaction sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and to cluster users by behavioral patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The proposed metrics in this paper, as well as intermediate variables generated from the computation process of the metrics, may be useful as features for these machine learning approaches. For example, users' explorations can be clustered using the feature vectors containing the time spent on each visual element (Equation 2), the vectors of TF-IDF values (Equation 3), or the highest level exploration uniqueness metric values. Similarly, both the two-dimensional wavelet power spectrum and the corresponding pacing metric can be used as features for machine learning algorithms.</p></div>

However, potential adopters need to be aware of certain properties of these metrics in order to apply them correctly. We now compare the metrics in our evaluations according to a list of criteria focusing on barriers such as interpretability, and derive initial guidelines on when and how to use these metrics.</p><p>The criteria used for metric comparison are adapted from the works in relevant fields evaluating metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, and are listed from lower to higher perspectives (i.e., from metric computation to human perception and cognition):</p><p>Computational cost (computational level): How much does it cost for the metric computation? The computation of some metrics is trivial, such as number-of-visited-elements. However, there is a certain level of complexity required to compute other metrics e.g., exploration-uniqueness. The computation of exploration-pacing requires more resources and its complexity depends on the choice of convergence parameters. The computation of bias-data-pointcoverage includes power operations on the number of interactions performed by the user, i.e., N k where N is the number of all the interactive elements in the visualization, and k is the number of interactions performed by the user. This suggests that extra steps may be needed to avoid the overflow caused by large numbers when dealing with an exploration session where a user interacts with the visualization a lot, e.g., k &gt; 100.</p><p>Computational context (computational level): Does the metric computation require extra context, i.e., out of the single user scope? Among all the metrics in our evaluation, the computation of exploration-uniqueness depends on the interaction logs not only of the current user being considered, but also those of the other users within the same group, while the computations of other metrics, e.g., exploration-pacing are only based on the current user, i.e., no extra context needed. This property influences the practical usage of a metric, e.g., a reasonable number of users should be selected when computing the exploration-uniqueness metric.</p><p>Comparability (application level): (How) can the metric values be compared? All of the evaluated metrics are comparative because they are quantitative measures of scale. The comparability of explorationuniqueness is constrained because the metric values are only comparative within a TF-IDF computation group, i.e., it is not feasible to compare the metric values of two users in different computation groups. The values of the exploration-pacing metric can be compared across user groups if the same set of parameters are used for the computation.</p><p>Interpretability (cognition level): How easily can the metric be understood or interpreted by human? The proposed metrics have different levels of interpretability. Metrics such as exploration-time and number-of-visited-elements could be considered readily interpretable, since people can easily understand the meaning of the values (e.g., 10 elements, 15 seconds). The values of some other metrics may require more cognitive effort to interpret, e.g., exploration-uniqueness, exploration-pacing and bias-data-point-coverage.</p><p>Knowledge coverage (cognition level): How much additional knowledge does the metric cover given other metrics? This dimension evaluates whether proposed metrics can uncover characteristics of users' exploration that other metrics do not capture. By examining correlations between metrics, we found that both proposed metrics, exploration-uniqueness and exploration-pacing may reveal different perspectives from other metrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">FUTURE WORK &amp; CONCLUSION</head><p>Despite their advantages, there are also limitations with the proposed metrics. For example, the uniqueness metric focuses on an interaction set, ignoring ordering effects, which may be another source of exploration diversity. The visualizations tested thus far are also constrained in interaction scope, implying that more complex interaction schemas may require more sophisticated approaches for developing useful metrics. Further, there are currently no established guidelines in the visualization community for evaluating other characteristics of proposed metrics, such as consistency, discriminability, and reliability. Given the changing landscape of visualization in the world, addressing challenges such as these may be fruitful areas for future work.</p><p>Each day, thousands of people interact with thousands of interactive visualizations across the web's vibrant and growing visualization ecosystem. However, our metrics for quantifying facets of peoples' open-ended explorations with these visualizations are lacking, as they are primarily based on low-level metrics such as elements visited or time spent exploring. The aim of this work is to characterize, develop, and evaluate metrics for visualization interaction that can be used in a variety of settings. We introduce two new metrics, uniqueness and pacing, and evaluate these metrics alongside those proposed in earlier and more recent research in visualization. The results of these evaluations suggest that, indeed, new metrics may provide new perspectives on how people interact with the visualizations they come across. We discuss the broad potential applications of new metrics for visualization interaction analysis, and enumerate some of the challenges future work in interaction metrics may face in the future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>)? • element(s): Which element(s) in the visualization are users interacting with? • duration: How long does the user interact with the visualization element(s)? • order: In what order do the interactions take place? • moment: At what moment in exploration does each interaction take place? • exploration time: How long does the user spend exploring</figDesc></figure>
