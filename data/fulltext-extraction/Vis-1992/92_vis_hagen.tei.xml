<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The geometric modeling of free-form curves and surfaces is of central importance for sophisticated CAD/ CAM systems. Apart from the pure construction of these curves and surfaces, the analysis of their quality is equally important in the design and manufacturing process. It is for example very important to test the convexity of a surface, to pinpoint inflection points, to visualize flat points and to visualize technical smoothness of surfaces. The purpose of this paper is to introduce generalized focal surfaces as a new tool for surface interrogation. A critical survey on other surface interrogation methods is given in <ref type="bibr">[</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Focal surfaces</head><p>Focal surfaces are known in the field of line congruences. Line congruences have been introduced in the field of visualization by Hagen and Pottmann (see <ref type="bibr">[Hagen et al,</ref><ref type="bibr">'91]</ref>). They can be used to visualize the pressure and heat distribution on an airplane, temperature, rainfall, ozone over the earth's surface, etc. However, the setting in this paper is different. Here, focal surfaces are used as a surface interrogation tool 0-81 862897-9192 $03.00 Ca 1992 LEER _ _ --to analyse the "quality" of the surface before further processing of the surface, for example in a NC-milling operation.</p><p>We represent surfaces parametrically as vector valued functions X ( u , w ) and N ( u , w ) is the unit normal vector of the surface. Given a set of unit vectors E(u, w ) , a line congruence is defined in parameter form :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C(u, w , 2) = X ( u , w ) + zE(u, w ) . (2.1)</formula><p>For each pair (U, w ) , (2.1) is a line of the congruence, the so called generator of the line congruence C. t is the parameter of its points indicating the signed distance of the corresponding point on X. On each generator of C, there are two special (real, complex, identical) points, called focal points. They are the osculating points of the generators with the so called Gratlinien der Kongruenztorsen. Therefore the focal surface is the locus of the focal points. Generally, there are two parts of the focal surface.</p><p>If E(u, w ) = N ( u , w ) , then C = CN is a normal congruence. The parametric representation of the focal surfaces of CN is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F;(u, w ) = X ( u , w ) + nf'(u, w ) N ( u , w ) ; i = 1,2 (2.2)</formula><p>where n1, I C~ are the principal curvatures. For more details about differential geometry see the appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 1: Focal points</head><p>Considering fundamental facts from differential geometry, it is obvious that the centers of curvature of the normal section curves at a particular point on a surface fill out a certain acgment of the normal vector at this point. The extremitia of there segments are the centers of curvature of two principal directions. These two points are called the focal points of this particular normal. This terminology is justified by the fact that a line congruence can be considered as the set of lines touching two surfaces, the focal surfaces of the line congruence. The points of contact between a line of the congruence and the two focal surfaces are the focal points of this line. It turns out that the focal points of a normal congruence are the centers of curvature of the two principal directiom (see [J. Eomchek,"ll]).</p><p>The sphere is the only surface for which the two sheets of the focal surface degenerate into a point and the Dupin cyclides are the only surfaces whose focal surfaces degenerate into curves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Generalized focal surfaces</head><p>We introduce a generalisatkm of the "classical" focal surface concept to achieve a new curve and surface interrogation tool.  In <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 4</ref> one can see the advantage of thb method versus curvature plots and orthotomics: the VCO pinpoints the unwanted situations. In the care of inflection points, the intersection k the pinpoint; the connecting normal marks the discontinuity.</p><p>The Generaked focal surfaces have the following form:</p><p>where the &amp; function f aor depends om the the</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">principal curvatures ~1 = I E~( U , w), ~2 = n2(u, w ) of X.</formula><p>The real number a k used M a acale factor. If the curvatures are very small you need a very large number a to distinct the two rarfacerr X(u,w) and F(u, w) on the acreen. Variation of thio factor can aL0 improve the visibility of reverd propertia of the focal rurtsce, for ex. one can get intenectwns clearer.</p><p>For different applications n e use different functions f ( 4 , 62) :</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Convexity test</head><formula xml:id="formula_3">f = K' f K z (3.3)</formula><p>It is important to know whether a certain region of the surface is convex, non-convex or whether it contains flat points ( I C~ = ~2 = 0).</p><p>The convexity of a surface is given by its Gaussian</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">curvature K = I C~ . ~2 .</formula><p>If K is positive all over the surface, it is called convex. Therefore, one is interested in the change of sign in the Gaussian curvature, which is the corresponding property to the undesired inflection points of curves. The generalired focal surface can visualise the change of sign in the Gaussian curvature with the factor f = ~1 . K Z : X(U, w ) and F(u, w ) intersect at points of vanishing Gaussian curvature.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> one can see the original surface X(U, w ) in red, which has a line of vanishing Gaussian curvature near the four corners. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Continuity of the surface</head><p>The factor f(u, w ) = K:(u, w ) + K;(u, w ) can also be used to visualize the continuity of the surface. The test surface <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref> consisting of 16 bicubic patches has only C ' continuity between the patches. This is visualised with its generalired focal surface which is not continuous between these patches (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>). In <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>, we see a generalized focal surface of a C2 continuous surface (4 patches), which is only CO there. .</p><p>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">+ f = - K 1 + K 2</formula><p>In the last couple of years, successful algorithms were developed to design and construct technically smooth curves and surfaces (see [Hagen -Santarelli,'92]).</p><p>Technical smoothness means that the data can be immediately transfered to the milling process. In this production chain, one part is still missing, the visualisation of technical smoothness as a quality test before the milling process.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>X(u1 w ) .</head><p>Now at the end we give a focal analysis of an practical example. Industrial data of a part of a hair dryer are used. There are two composed surfaces consisting of several patches, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 10</ref> at the bottom. For each surface you can see the generalized focal surfaces with f = K : + K ;~. It is visible that the twosurfaces (red) are not C2-continuous, because the focal surfaces aren't continuous.</p><p>In addition this focal analysis shows the curvature behaviour of these surfaces. The two-dimensional linear subspace T p X of E3 generated by the span { X I , X Z } is called the tangent space of X at P. The unit normal field N is given by: BW the moving frame ( X I , X Z , N } is the Gaussian frame. The Gaussian frame is in general not an orthogonal frame. Every tangential vector field y along the surface X : U -$ E3 can be represented in the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">~( u , W ) = Au(u, W ) * X i ( u , W) + Aw(u, W ) * X Z ( U , W)</formula><p>The bilinear form on T p X induced by the inner product of E3 by restriction is called the first fundamental form of the surface. The matrix representation of the first fundamental form I p with respect to the basis { X I , X Z ) of T p X is given by:  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">N , Xij &gt; i , j = 1,2 (A.4)</ref> The Weingarten map L is self-adjoint, the eigenvalues kl, k p are therefore real and the corresponding eigen- where e2 is the principal normal vector of the space curve y. The implicit function theorem implies the existence of this normal section curve. To calculate the extreme values of the curvature of a normal section curve (the normal section curvature) we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers because we are looking for the extreme values of the normal section curvature kN with the condition llc(s)ll = 1. As the result of these considerations we obtain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">hij = &lt; -Ni, X j &gt; = &lt;</formula><p>Unless the normal section curvature is the same for all directions there are two perpendicular directions A1 and A2 in which kN attains its absolute maximum and its absolute minimum values. These directions are the principal directions with the corresponding normal section curvatures kl and kz.</p><p>For A = A1 cos 'p + A2 sin 'p we get Euler's formula:</p><p>If the principal directions are taken as coordinate axes, Euler's formula implies the so-called Dupin indicatrk</p><p>We use the Dupin indicatrices as a tool to visualige curvature situations on surfaces. The Dupin indicatrices at elliptk points (k &gt; 0) are ellipses, at hyperbolic points ( k &lt; 0) pairs of hyperbolas, and at parabolic points (k = 0) pairs of parallel lines. Planar points (kl = kz = 0) are degenerated parabolic cases.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Hagen et d,'90].</figDesc></figure>
