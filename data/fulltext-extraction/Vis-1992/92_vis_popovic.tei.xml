				<p>This case study is a result of a six weeks feasibility exercise, the aim of which was to explore the extent to which the existing visualisation software can be used for visualising ISIS Neutron Scattering Data. ISIS, situated at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, is a world class experimental facility devoted to the use of pulsed neutrons and muons to investigate the microscopic structure and dynamics of all classes of condensed matter. The result of the feasibiliry srudy demonstrated the benefits of using visualisation in exploring material science data and it also proved that it is possible to satisfy most of the requirements ISIS researchers place on a software environment by using AVS and without writing any new code. The paper lists the problems encountered and where possible suggests solutions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1: Introduction</head><p>It is frequently the case that scientists tend to invest in expensive instrumental facilities rather than in computing hardware and software. So, it is not unusual to have a situation where data acquired by an instrument worth a million pounds is analysed by a PC running public domain software. Scientists dedicated to their work are reluctant to spend time evaluating and leaning to use the latest computer software. They tend to believe that visualisation is just a form of computer graphics which produces fancier pictures but on much more expensive equipment. Here lies the problem for justifying the use of visualisation.</p><p>This case study was carried out to demonstrate to scientists that the new tools now available for scientific visualisation can offer a significant step forward in helping them to understand and gain insight from their data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2: About ISIS</head><p>Rutherford Appleton Laboratory's ISIS facility is the world's most powerful pulsed neutron source. Neutrons are one of the key microscopic probes of condensed matter. Along with X-rays, electrons and light scattering, it provides the necessary techniques for understanding matter at an atomic level. As such, the technique underpins ' virtually all areas of condensed matter science from engineering and materials on one side, to macromolecular chemistry and biology on the other.</p><p>ISIS offers research facilities to more than 500 scientists each year from the UK, Europe and the rest of the world for their studies of the fundamend properties of solids and liquids. More than 15 instruments are laid out for capturing measurements (in various data formats) continuously during the experiment.</p><p>All instruments are controlled by minicomputers (VAX-113, VAXstations or transputer networks) and a significant amount of data processing is performed directly on the front end computer. In-house software is mainly used for the data analysis. Graphical representation of the data and analysis results is displayed using the Uniras graphical package. ISIS scientists saw the need for improved facilities to analyse the large amount of data that was being collected and wanted to find out whether modem visualisation systems such as AVS were suitable.At the time of this feasibility study ISIS staff were looking into the suitability for their work of the PV-WAVE and Physics Analysis Workstation (PAW, a procedure library developed by CERN) software packages as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3: About Our Research Group</head><p>Rutherford Appleton Laboratory is the largest of the four laboratories operated by the UK Science and Engineering Research Council with a staff of 1200. Its Informatics Department provides support for, and itself participates in, research and development activities in many areas of Information Technology. The Visualisation Group provides expertise to engineers and scientists throughout the UK academic community.</p><p>Our visualisation environment is based on Sun Sparc-Stations, IBM RS6000, Silicon Graphics Indigo and Stardent ST2000 and ST750 systems. Visualisation software used in the group includes AVS, Explorer, apE and KhOl-OS.</p><p>The Stardent ST2000 and AVS 3.0 were used for this exercise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4: Description of Data</head><p>There were two kinds of data used in this feasibility study: two and three dimensional arrays (or fields in AVS terminology) of a single floating point value. The sizes of the two dimensional arrays were 64x64 and 80x80 and the three dimensional array was 60x80~32; molecular data in the format which can be processed by the Schakal program (a program for graphics representation of molecular and crystallography models). All files were in ASCII format. Locally, ISIS researchers represent files in binary format, but because of the incompatibility of the two hardware systems used, binary to ASCII and then ASCII to binary conversion had to be ISIS experimental data comes in many other formats.</p><p>These two simple examples were chosen for the feasibility study as being representative. PerfOrmed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5: ISIS Requirements</head><p>Generally speaking, ISIS researchers are interested in a visualisation system that has a wide range of functionality, is widely available on all platforms (preferably on PC's as well), does not cost a lot and is easy to use. They want the system to be available to all scientists using ISIS facilities, many of whom do not work at the Laboratory or even in the same country.</p><p>' In particular, they were interested to see whether a visualisation system can offer all the functionality their current graphics software has and how much more the system could give.</p><p>In terms of graphics, they wanted their two dimensional arrays to be represented as images, line contours or meshes. They wanted an isosurface technique for three dimensional arrays and three dimensional geometrical (i.e. "ball and stick") representation of their molecular data.</p><p>In addition to this, they also required the following capabilities:</p><p>display an analysed dataset from SXD (one of the ISIS instruments) emphasizing the positions and shapes of the diffuse weak peaks in the presence of the many higher intensity sharp peaks which are not of interest to this experiment: perform algebraic operations on two arrays producing a third array: display a subset of an array: display a set of one dimensional arrays on a single plot (around 50 a m y s with roughly 2000 elements each); perform interpolation between points of a one dimensional array; have a colour legend displayed together with an image; visualise molecular data represented in formats other than Schakal or Protein Data Bank PDB (e.g. Cssr and STUPLO); offer an animation technique;</p><p>handle an may of known errors associated with a rectangular array of raw data; offer non-linear colour mapping and special colour maps (i.e. heat colour coding); use the given coordinate system description to display axes and their labels automatically: offer CGM output; offer production quality output on paper and film. Many of the requirements were specified in the form of illustrations of what was wanted from which detailed specifications had to be inferred.</p><p>An interesting aspect of the work was the way in which early demonstrations of the capability of a visualisation system inspired the scientists to conceive new ways of looking at their data. This was one of the most exciting benefits of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6: AVS Solutions</head><p>The aim of the study was to try to fully satisfy the list of requirements put forward by the ISIS scientists. It also attempted to apply visualisation techniques not originally specified but available in AVS 3.0.</p><p>Satisfying many of the requirements was straightforward using standard features of AVS. These will not be treated in this section. Instead, this section will concentrate on requirements that needed more work in order to be met, requirements only partially met and also list techniques not specified but offered as possibly useful.</p><p>Since it was not precisely explained how the position and shapes of the diffuse weak peaks should be emphasized in the presence of many higher intensity sharp peaks, at least two methods were identified as appropriate in AVS. One method thresholds data values by setting data values out of range to zero, and the other sets (clamps) data values out of range to the minimum (or maximum) value. The changed dataset can be sent to all subsequent modules in AVS network for processing and displaying. Alternatively, the chosen technique can be applied to a dataset only before it enters a particular module. For example, a dataset can be clamped just before colourising so that the whole dataset will be displayed but the colourmap will be stretched to cover only the interesting range. It is up to the user to decide which technique is most suitable and the scope of the changed dataset. An example is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>It is possible to draw a graph representation of a onedimensional array, but AVS 3.0 could not easily display more than one graph in the same window. As only limited data for testing was available it was not possible to predict whether the picture would look too busy with 50 graphs over 2000 points. It was also desired to smooth the plotted data for which additional interpolation methods would need to be implemented.</p><p>We also demonstrated to ISIS scientists what other visualisation techniques AVS 3.0 could offer for their data. These are as follows: since there are more than a dozen instruments and since even datasets from the same instrument can have different ranges of values (depending on material used in the experiment) it cannot be known in advance where in the dataset to look for useful information.</p><p>There are modules in AVS for calculating the statistics of a dataset. These could be an appropriate tool for the problem; AVS offers a set of image processing techniques that can be applied to image representations of ISIS datasets (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> for examples of median and Laplacian filters and histogram stretch image processing techniques): a series of orthogonal or arbitrary slices can be taken through a three dimensional dataset (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 3 and   4)</ref>; data elements within a volume can be represented by spheres of various radii and colour depending on their values (see left half of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5)</ref>; a three dimensional array can be treated as a volume and displayed by one of a number of rendering techniques, such as ray tracing or alpha blending; vector gradients can be calculated for each volume element and represented as lines. It is also possible to treat the vector gradient field as a velocity vector field and to use the particle advector technique, stream lines or any other appropriate representation method; if a three dimensional array is displayed in a three dimensional space, it is possible to move through that space and to probe data values at any location (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>).</p><p>An obvious advantage in using AVS (or any other visualisation application builder) is that all these tools are available during one session and parameters can be changed interactively in a single run. There is no need for reprdgramming and recompiling to change settings. Three dimensional manipulation of the data in real time is possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7: What is Missing in AVS 3.0</head><p>Although many of the initial requirements could be satisfied by AVS 3.0, others could not. It is possible that some of the deficiencies would be easy to overcome by adding new moduIes/converters/colourmaps to those existing in AVS, or indeed that someone from the visualisation community has already solved them. It could be that some of the problems are not general enough to be solved directly in AVS but are rather needed by ISIS scientists only. Some of these functions may be added in future releases.</p><p>Because of the limited time available for this study, we made a decision not to write any new modules for these functions at this time, but rather to identify where we could see a requirement. In some cases. new functionality would have to be added to AVS. These shortcomings are indicated below with an indication how the problem could be overcome: apart from PDB and Schakal (converter obtained from the Earth Science Department of Oxford University), no other molecular data format converters are available for AVS. Some popular ones are Cssr and STUPLO. It is possible to overcome this problem by writing the necessary converters; there are more popular methods for representing silicate structures than "ball and stick". One is to represent these structures as a set of linked tetrahedra. None of the previously mentioned molecular data formats contains enough information for the building of this molecular model. An AVS converter for an alternative data format could be written to solve the problem:</p><p>there is no general appmach in AVS or any other visualisation application builder to representing errors associated with a set of measured data. Any available visualisation technique can be used for error data in combination with techniques applied to measured data. However, it is felt that a tighter connection and handling of the two datasets is needed. This matter may need more investigation and development in AVS if the system is to find greater use in analysing scientific data;</p><p>generally, there is an impression that the AVS colour editor (as well as colour editors implemented by other visualisation packages) are incomplete and not easy to use. The possible improvements among others could include having colour models other than RGB or HSV (CIE colour model and colour coordinates are particularly desirable), having better control over the value to colour mapping and non-linear interpolation in colour space using standard or user written functions: there are only a limited number of non-linear (e.g. exponential, logarithmic) or customised (e.g. heat colour coding, geographical maps coding) colourmaps available. However in AVS it is easy to generate additional ones if required by the user;</p><p>use of interpolation in "arbitrary slicer" module can lead to undesired "out of focus" effects: scientists and engineers in their work will need to know the precise scale used for data values and parameters. They also need to know the exact value represented by, say, colour on the visualisation graphical output. Unfortunately, in AVS this is difficult or impossible in some cases. For example, although the Field Legend module gives a good representation for linear, smooth ramps, stepped colourmaps will be smoothed out. Anew module could be written. Also Graph Viewer does not give an easy way to show colours associated with contour levels. This problem would be better solved directly in AVS;</p><p>there is no way of producing CGM output files from AVS. A project to implement AVS output in CGM format has been started by our group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>8: General Problems</head><p>Not all of the problems we came across during this feasibility study are due to imperfections of today's visualisation software packages. One of the most annoying problems was production of adequate hardcopy output illustrating hours of visualisation work done on some data- We did not try to produce output on film far this study. The techniques used in generating informative animations for film and video production are not widely known, especially among scientists. Unless considerable specialist skill is used, the result of animating scientific data can be disappointing or even misleading.</p><p>It is sometimes also difficult for scientists to adapt to interactive three dimensional presentation of their data when they are trained to think in two dimensions. This is especially true when using a three dimensional input device. They find it entertaining, but not precise enough to control. A lack of immediate response because data processing delays does not help.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>9: Benefits and Conclusions</head><p>This was one in a series of visualisation feasibility studies done by our group in various scientific and engineering areas [2], [ 5 ] . We found the exercise extremely useful for the following reasons: the study gave us an indication of what scientists expect from visualisation and how they define their requirements; the study taught us how to make scientists interested in visualisation: we gained further insight into methods and techniques used in modem scientific research; we understood better what was missing in AVS which helped us determine our directions of future visualilisation developments. One of the most important outcomes of the study, however, was that the scientists became much more aware of the potential of visualisation tools to help them understand their data better. For example, they recognised that the 3D structure of the crystallographic data closely resembles that of the corresponding ball and stick molecular structure, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>. In cases such      as this where the data was obtained from different sources, visualisation was able to offer genuine insight which would have been difficult or even impossible to achieve by other means.</p><p>An important factor in increasing the use of visualisation tools by scientists and engineers will be to make them more approachable and affordable but perhaps especially, to build into them the quantitative facilities for measurement and comparison which practising scientists need, as well as the ability to produce impressive gmphics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>10:Acknowledgement</head><p>I wish to thank the staff of ISIS Division for providing me with their data for testing and especially to Mrs K M Crennell for pviding detailed guidance on the scientists' requirements and for cooperation and support given during the study.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>set [l], [3], [4]. When the user, having got to the stage where the output on the screen has all important features of the dataset distinguishable and properly represented, sends this output to a printer or a hardcopy device the final result is almost always disappointing. The greys on the monitor tend to appear brown (or at least not grey) on the print. Bright blues come out dull and dark. Other colours appear desaturated, and most of the hues on the print can be different from those on the screen. While some degradation in quality is only to be expected, the above shortcomings are quite another matter. What is more, a quick solution to the problem does not exist. The group is currently studying solutions to this problem, based on determining a transform from colour values used in representing an image created on a monitor into values suitable for driving the printer [I].</figDesc></figure>
