				<p>We describe a new way to reconstruct human fossils from fragmentary fossil material. Unlike the traditional method of making physical models using clay, this new approach is based on geometrical modeling and visualization of digitized fossil data. It can provide anthropologists with both quantifiable, computer-based geometric (CAD) models and physical plastic reconstructions of fossils. &apos;The taxonomic family that includes: human beings, their direct ancestors, and close relatives, all of whom descendedfrom a common ancestor which split from the great apes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Paleoanthropological Reconstruction of Fossils</head><p>Paleoanthropologists study the fossilized anatomical remains of forebears of our species, Homo sapiens sapiens, and its closest relatives amongst the primates. Hominid' fossils and the archeological context in which they are found often provide tests of models of natural history and the circumstances in which humanity evolved. However, because the fossil record has improved, much more attention is now being paid to theories of relationships between these extinct forms and ourselves.</p><p>Morphology and morphometrics are the dual bases from which anthropologists begin this discourse. The first step is to recognize anatomical characteristics shared by groups of fossils. If these shared characters can be reasonably assumed to be heritable (due more to genes than habitus) they are used to infer membership in a species, that is, an interbreeding population. Character variation observed between such proposed extinct groupings is used to propose a phylogeny, that is, a theory on the relationship of species though time. Two species are interpreted to be sisters when they share a novel character, presumably "derived" from a shared common ancestor. Of course their next closest relative, the comparison "outgroup" , will not exhibit this novel character, but all will share "conservative" characters inherited from their last common ancestor.</p><p>It is often necessary to undertake the physical reconstruction of a fossil specimen in order to fruitfully study its morphology. Few vertebrate fossils are complete and undamaged when found (although teeth often do survive intact, and therefore have been studied extensively). Most often an organism's remains will be fragmentary pieces that have been broken and or deformed by the burial process, if not by carnivores just prior to interment. In many cases only small portions of the anatomy are preserved. Unlike most dental characters, the elucidation of many characters in other regions of the anatomy requires positional adjacency of much, if not all, of a bone or regional set of bones (e.g. the skull, the rib cage, the pelvis, or a limb segment). If the remains of no single organism preserve much of the region of interest it is often useful to combine portions of different individuals into a composite.</p><p>Anthropological reconstruction is a process akin to solving a three-dimensional (3D) jigsaw puzzle, in which many of the pieces are missing or deformed. Traditionally, composite reconstructions, as well as those of extremely fragmentary or damaged individuals, have been done by gluing together either the pieces of one individual or casts of fragments made from multiple specimens. For specimens that have been highly warped by the burial process, casts can be sectioned and repositioned to minimize obvious geological deformities (although there are obvious pitfalls in this "constructive morphology"). When there are gaps between pieces, sticks can be inserted or a clay model of the same anatomical region of a closely related species can be used as a substrate.</p><p>Computerized digitization and visualization techniques now offer the opportunity to make reconstructions on-screen, quantify alterations (such as sizing, mirroring, or warping), as well as statistical comparisons with digitizations of other forms. Quantification of the reconstruction process brings the obvious advantage of metrically describing the assumptions behind any unwarping or repositioning. The ability to resize landmark data sets effectively allows composite reconstructions of pieces from individuals who vary in size due to age, sex, health, etc. Hypothesized allometric relationships may also be tested.</p><p>Biomedical technological advances in statistics, cephalometrics, and more recently computer-aided data-capture and Visualization, have found a ready audience among paleoanthropologists. However, morphometrics, the combination of biology, geometry, and statistics <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>, has only recently begun to take advantage of 3D data capture and visualization advances In terms of digitization there are many modalities available. Techniques such as laser-light scanners <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[8]</ref> or electromagnetic stylus devices [12] can be used to digitize external surfaces. However, to capture the entire volumetric solid of a fossil fragment (including internal features) other techniques such as CT or MR must be employed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>12, 121.</head><p>Upon visual inspection fossil remains can appear quite fresh but have invariably been mineralized to some degree by the surrounding ground water. If found within a stony matrix, delicate specimens are not always easily removed. If a relatively complete fossil skull can be removed and its outer surfaces cleaned, in most cases the internal anatomy must remain filled or obscured by matrix. Protocols have been developed to use clinical as well as industrial CT-scanners as a non-destructive means of viewing this anatomy. In a clinical setting this means resetting the scanner to produce and record higher levels of radiation (Hounsfield units) than that used for patients 13, 141.</p><p>It is only very recently, however, that the data from 3D CT studies have been used for quantitative analyses [4, 10, 131. Coordinate data obtained from 3D CT images, can be used to extract quantities such as landmark locations, linear and angular measurements, line tracings, surface patches, and ROI volumes. Typical error terms have been discussed in <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>.</p><p>The collaboration between the Robotics and Augmentation Group at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, the New York University Medical Center's Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery, the MusCe de 1'Homme Anthropology Laboratory, and the Nancy University Department of Anatomy has been aimed at acquiring a 3D CT database of normal, pathological, and fossil human crania for use in the development of morphometric techniques to visualize, measure, construct averages, and make statistical comparisons of these data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Homo erectus/Homo sapiens Transition in Northwest Africa</head><p>The Middle Pleistocene (780,000-28,000 years BP) is the time period during which most paleoanthropologists would agree on the dual presence of late surviving H o m o eTectus populations, especially in China at Zhoukoudian and in Indonesia at Solo, and earliest Homo sapiens in Africa and Europe. It is possible that both species co-existed toward the end of this period in eastern Asia <ref type="bibr">[ll]</ref>.</p><p>This paper describes the application of new visualization and analytic tools towards the reconstruction of a composite northwest African human from the remains of two individuals from two different Moroccan fossil sites: a braincase (apparently a small female) from Salk and two facial fragments (apparently a male or a larger female) from Thomas Quarry. Both sites have been dated to approximately 400,000 years [5].</p><p>The reason for reconstructing this composite skull is that no complete skull is known from northwest Africa prior to 120,000 years. (Two partial skulls of this age, one nearly complete, are known from the Djebel Irhoud site, also in Morocco.) It is a topic for debate, and for another paper, whether the Sal6 and Thomas Quarry specimens represent members of Homo erectus, "archaic" Homo supiens, or neither.</p><p>The Salk vault is the majority of a brain case which begins at the rear of the face just behind the brow and palate. Although it consists of two unjoined superior and inferior fragments (respectively, the red and green pieces in figures 1-S), it is otherwise largely complete. When found there was a natural endocast of the brain within these two fragments. It has since been molded and dissolved to obtain additional pieces of the vault which were discovered to be floating inside of it. While mandibular remains from the Thomas Quarry site are well known, the two facial fragments are currently undescribed. This face consists of two pieces, a left frontonasolacrimal fragment (shown as the white piece in the figures) and a left maxillary fragment (the magenta piece in the figures) containing the postcanine dentition. Our goal was to combine the remains of the Salk vault and the Thomas Quarry face into a single model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Building Fossil Reconstruction Tools</head><p>The visualization and manipulation tools for solving the reconstruction problem were created using the IBM Data Explorer scientific visualization environment. The system has a user interface called the "Visual Program Editor" which is an on-screen visual programming language for creating visualizations of multidimensional data sets. The user creates visual programs by connecting boxes (representing basic visualization modules) into a logical network. Once a visualization has been created, various parameters can be interactively varied using mouse-operated inteructors, i.e. sliders, steppers, dials, buttons, and probes (3D cursors).</p><p>The anthropological reconstructions were built running Data Explorer on a IBM POWER Visualization System consisting of a 32-processor parallel computer with 512MB of RAM, a high-speed parallel disk array, and a high-speed frame buffer. This system provided the power required to achieve real-time interactive manipulation of the large data sets produced from the CT scans of the Sal6 and Thomas Quarry fossils. (This work can also be done by running Data Explorer on a standard RS/SOOO workstation, although of course, it will run much more slowly).</p><p>A major reason for developing our fossil reconstruction system with a visual programming interface like Data Explorer is that, compared with a regular programming language, the design cycle for creating the required visualization and manipulation tools is very short, and existing tools are easily modifiable and extensible. We found that a number of iterations of the design cycle were required to come up with a satisfactory set of tools. This iterative approach would have been prohibitively expensive in terms of manpower if a conventional programming language were used. Perhaps even more important is the fact that visual programming allows the final end-users of the system (be they anthropologists, physicians, or whoever) to be actively involved in the actual design cycle itself, rather than to be presented with a finished system that is often (a) not properly tailored to their needs, and (b) difficult to modify after the fact. At the risk of belaboring the point, we feel that the importance of including the end-users in the design of the tools that they are going to use is one of the most important points to emerge from this case-study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>All the fossil specimens were CT-scanned in Paris by J-JH and MB on a GE 9800 scanner. The scanned data were converted from the manufacturer-specific file format to a standard one (AAPM) at the NYU Medical Center, using the QSH image processing toolkit <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[9]</ref>.</p><p>The ALLIGATOR surface construction algorithm [6, 71 was used to extract the surfaces of the fossils from the image data. These surfaces were converted into Data Explorer format. Although Data Explorer has an isosurface module that can be used to create surfaces, ALLIGATOR was used since it produces topologically-connected surfaces which made it easy to distinguish and choose between disjoint bodies with iso-surfaces sharing a common iso-value.</p><p>In the case of this fossil data, the C T scanner headholder produced iso-surfaces with the same iso-value as the fossils themselves. Each of the 4 fossil pieces was scanned separately, and so there were 4 head-holder bodies that needed to be removed from the data before we could begin the reconstruction process, since these extraneous pieces obscured our view of the fossil pieces from many angles.</p><p>Another advantage of using ALLIGATOR is that it produces significantly more concise representations of isosurfaces than the Data Explorer isosurface moduleon average it produces only 40% of the triangles produced by the Data Explorer isosurface module to represent the same surface. This, together with the elimination of the head-holders, resulted in a 3:l reduction in the amount of data passed on to Data Explorer, significantly reducing memory requirements and speeding up the processing.</p><p>The main manipulation tools that were created for the reconstruction were translation, rotation, scaling modules to position and size the fossil fragments relative to one another, and a mirror-imaging module to fill in missing pieces based on right-left bilateral symmetry. The Visualization tools used were the standard ones provided by Data Explorer.</p><p>The user interface to the manipulation tools is through interactors. Of great value is the fact that these interactors can be used to manipulate the data both quantitatively (by typing in the numerical values of interactor parameters) and qualitatively (by manip ulation of the interactors with the mouse, and visual inspection of the results). Furthermore, the qualitative manipulations can be quantified, since the parameter values are accessible. For example, the relative d i n g of the fossil pieces was done by qualitative "eye-balling", but once the final result was obtained, we could record the scaling constant.</p><p>We experimented with a number of approaches to moving the individual pieces and found the most useful approach was to provide the capability for decoupling all 6 degrees of freedom. This allows the user to constrain motion to 1 degree of freedom at a time, although more general constraints can also be chosen. Translation is controlled with a 3D cursor (with o p tional decoupling constraints), and rotation is specified using a vector interactor that contains 3 independent stepper controls.</p><p>The reconstruction of the composite individual was done as follows. First a midsagittal plane (the plane that separates the left and right halves of the skull) was created (shown as the blue, translucent plane in the figures). The Sal6 basicranial piece was positioned, aligning the anterior and posterior (front and back) notches of the foramen magnum (the largest hole in the base of the skull) with this midsagittal plane <ref type="figure">(figure 1)</ref>. The Sal6 skullcap (shown in green) was then positioned using the midline of the superior sagittal sinus for midsagittal alignment. Since the two Salk fragments have no points in common, the superior/interior (vertical) positioning was done visually using a 3D cursor.</p><p>The Thomas Quarry pieces were then added. First the left upper facial fragment (shown in white) was scaled, and positioned on the Salk vault (green) by overlapping both frontal squamae (the flat portion just behind the brow) so that the temporal lines on the two pieces formed a continuous line, and the edges of the bone interdigitated. Since there was no right upper facial fragment, the mirror-imaging tool was used to create one (cyan) by reflecting the left piece about the mideagittal plane.</p><p>The mirror-imaging tool was also applied to the Thomas Quarry left maxillary segment (magenta) to create the matching right segment (yellow). Furthermore, in thia case mirror-imaging also proved critical in the actual positioning of the original (left) piece. The Sal6 basicranium (red) has a small remnant of the posterior-most portion (the "maxillary buttress") of the right maxillary segment, including the posterior half of the third molar. The Thomas Quarry left facial fragment preserves the entire left third molar. Therefore the "phantom" right facial fragment (yellow) was positioned by aligning its maxillary buttress and third molar with those of maxillary segment of the the Salk basicranium. Finally, the original (left) Thomas Quarry facial fragment was positioned using bilateral symmetry.</p><p>The resulting reconstruction should give anthropologists a much better idea of the cranial morphology and architecture of this extinct hominid population. However, there is still a large gap in the mid-facial region and no mandible in the reconstruction shown here. This gap is especially apparent in figure 4 where fragments of the basicranium are seen to fill the area between the roof of the orbits and the two maxillary arches. There is another mid-facial fragment belonging to the same Thomas Quarry face not shown here. This fragment will fill much of the midline area. Once it is scanned it will be added to the reconstruction. The Thomas I mandible or one of the three Middle Pleistocene mandibles from the Ternifine site in Algeria could be added at a later date.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Future Work</head><p>The data set from the final reconstruction of the composite skull will soon be used to create a plastic 3D model with a Stratasys (TM) rapid prototyping device at the NYU Robotics Laboratory. Plastic models are invaluable study aids for researchers and students of human evolution who have no interest in or no access to a visualization workstation.</p><p>For those who do have access to such hardware and software we are as yet unable to make the data set available because of copyright constraints held by the Moroccan authorities and their relationship with the MusCe de 1'Homme in Paris. This is commonly the case with human fossils. All the authors would like to see these and other fossil and modern human CT-data sets available without restrictions. Unfortunately the structure for such exchanges does not yet exist.</p><p>We plan comparisons with more complete specimens of similar appearance and age, for example, the skull from the Broken Hill mine in Zambia (near Lusaka). The reconstruction will also be compared to complete cranial data sets of Homo erectus and averaged Homo sapiens sapiens.</p><p>These comparisons will be both qualitative and quantitative. Warping one specimen onto the other will give residual values. It will also be useful to compute residuals between features of individual fossils and normative data sets. We believe that future advances in paleoanthropological imaging depends on </p></div>
