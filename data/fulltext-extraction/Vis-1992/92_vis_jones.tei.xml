				<p>The U.S. Army corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station is currently participating in an investigation of the effects of deepening the ship channel in Galveston Bay. WES researchers have constructed a three-dimensional finite element hydrodynamic model of the bay as part of the investigation. They are employing the model to simulate tidal cycles in the bay over a one-year period in order to view changes in water velocities and salinity. This case study documents a project undertaken cooperatively b y the WES Hydraulics Laboratory and the Information Technology Laboratory Scientific Visualization Center to visualize the simulation results. The project comprised three overall stages, 1) analyzing model requirements and determining suitable visualization techniques, 2) visualizing a preliminary, smaller scale model to verify the techniques chosen in the first stage, and 3) visualizing the full-scale model. The first two stages are completed. The third stage is ongoing. Problems encountered and resolutions of problems at each stage are described. Validation as well as insights revealed about the model through the preliminary and final visualization are discussed. Current application of visualization techniques to the model is reported. Conclusions and benefits of the cooperative project to both the hydraulics researchers and the visualization team are presented.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>and widening the Houston and Galveston ship channels in Galveston Bay, associated with the Houston-Galveston Navigation Channels, Texas Project. ' The research seeks to minimize potential impacts to existing marine life in the bay. Researchers in the WES Hydraulics Laboratory have constructed a three dimensional finite element hydrodynamic model of the bay as part of the investigation. They are employing the model to simulate tidal cycles in the bay over a oneyear period. The simulation enables the researchers to observe changes in water velocities and salinity, particularly the impact of these changes on oyster production in the bay. The velocity and salinity results from the simulation will be used to drive an oyster production model developed by researchers at Texas A&amp;M University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Project Requirements</head><p>The hydraulics researchers required some means of visualizing the simulation results during the investigation. The Scientific Visualization Center (SVC), an interdisciplinary group of engineers and computer scientists within the Information Technology Laboratory at WES, worked cooperatively with the Hydraulics Laboratory to determine a method for visualizing the model results. Certain minimum requirements for the visualization were apparent at the outset. First, the engineers desired a visual product which could serve 'The proposed channel project, scheduled to be constructed in two phases, includes plana to deepen the Houston ship channel from the existing 40-feet depth to 45 feet in depth, and widen it from 400 to 530 feet in the first phase. A 450-foot wide section of the 1,125-foot wide Galveston Channel will be opened from the existing 40-ft depth to 45 feet. There are two plans for both channels to be deepened to 50 feet and the Houston ship channel to be widened to 600 feet.</p><p>as an effective workroom tool as well as provide presentation quality graphics. In addition, the project clearly demanded some type of finite element postprocessing program capable of displaying vector and scalar information and handling time-dependent data.</p><p>The complexity and scope of the project, however, posed additional requirements for the visualization technique chosen. The total volume of data generated by the simulation, estimated at 40 gigabytes, made a distributed computing environment desirable if not essential. Further, the horizontal and vertical extents of the numerical model, 40 miles and 50 miles, respectively, far exceeded the depth, 40 feet, of the existing ship channel. This disparity between the dimensions of the data necessitated some facility for scaling data along the z axis. Remaining criteria included the capability to process unstructured grids.</p><p>The visualization team considered two alternatives in order to satisfy the project requirements, developing an in-house solution or selecting from existing tools. Given the time constraints and scope of the project, the team explored existing solutions as a first alternative. The Flow Analysis Software Toolkit (FAST) <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>, a visualization program developed by NASA and available at the center, met the minimum project requirements. FAST displays both vector and scalar data and provides time-dependent data support. It also produces both on-screen and presentation quality animations. However, the program requires a structured grid, and was therefore precluded as a first choice. Other tools evaluated included I-DEAS [2] and NISA <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>. Both of these programs process unstructured grids as well as time-dependent data, but lack adequate support for producing animations. Another candidate considered, MovieBYU <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, met all of the above-mentioned requirements, support for unstructured grids, time-dependent data, and animation. However, similar to each of the previous tools considered, the software required the data sets to reside on the workstation, thus minimizing its practicality.</p><p>Multi-Purpose Graphics System (MPGS) [5], a distributed visualization software package produced by Cray Research Inc., emerged as the candidate addressing the largest number of the project's requirements. In addition to meeting the minimum requirements of finite element post-processing, time-dependent data support, and capability to display vector and scalar data, MPGS accepts both structured and unstructured grids. Also, residing on both the Cray supercomputer and a local high performance graphics workstation, the software provides the distributed computing environment considered desirable for the project.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Preliminary Visualization</head><p>Prior to initiating the Galveston Bay visualization, preliminary investigations were performed on a smaller model in cooperation with the hydraulics engineers. These investigations would verify the appropriateness of MPGS for the larger model. During this investigative phase, the visualization team utilized numerical data from the Rip Rap test facility, a physical model employed to examine effects of differing rock sizes in bank stabilization studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Visualizing Rip Rap Test Facility Model</head><p>Simpler than the Galveston model in both scale and complexity, the Rip Rap test facility model proved a suitable choice for investigative purposes. The model covered a much smaller area, contained only two element types, and calculated only water velocities and depth after reaching steady state. Nevertheless, the Rip Rap model contained many essential properties of the full-scale problem, including vector data, an unstructured grid, and large output files residing on the supercomputer. Though smaller in scale than Galveston, a similar disparity existed in the dimensions of the Rip Rap test facility (800 ft in length and 25 ft in width versus 3 ft in depth).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Translation Issues</head><p>The hydraulic researchers utilized the computer program RMA-10 [3] to construct numerical models of the Rip Rap test facility and Galveston Bay. The program produces one large binary output file, containing model geometry and vector and scalar results. In the case of the Rip Rap model, only model geometry and water velocity vectors comprised the pertinent data in the file. Recall also that the Rip Rap simulation modelled steady state conditions; the output file, therefore, contained only a single time step of data.</p><p>Obtaining the nodal ordering of the element types required by MPGS presented an initial problem in the translation process. The number of nodes employed by RMA-10 to define element types posed another problem: RMA-10 uses both midside and corner nodes, whereas MPGS uses only corner nodes. To assist in data translation, MPGS furnishes a program, FEMMPGS, which accepts a generic finite element format and converts this generic data format to that required by MPGS. FEMMPGS accepts four classes of input files, a materials file containing material types and associated elements, a geometry file containing nodal coordinates and connectivities, a vector data file, and a scalar data file. The program then outputs three files in MPGS format, a file describing the initial geometry of the model, an optional scalar output file, and an optional vector output file. The RMA-10 data files were translated to the generic, intermediate format and input to FEMMPGS, which then produced the requisite geometry file and a vector output file in MPGS format. (Refer to </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4">Results of Preliminary Investigation</head><p>The preliminary visualization of Rip Rap demonstrated MPGS to be an appropriate tool for visualizing the Galveston Bay model. In addition to postprocessing the data, the software allowed verification of the model geometry and afforded numerous techniques for viewing vector data, including vector plots, shaded contours, velocity profiles, and particle tracing. Further, MPGS effectively distributed the graphics and data management tasks between the local graphics workstation and the supercomputer. as an unanticipated benefit, MPGS permitted substituting empirical data for simulation data at selected cross-sections, thereby enabling researchers to compare measured data with computed results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Visualizing Galveston Bay Model</head><p>To restate, the Galveston Bay model far exceeded the preliminary model in both complexity and scope. The bay presented a more complex geometry requiring additional 2D and 3D element types to model such factors as inflow and outflow of water and wind effects on the bay. Much larger in scale than Rip Rap, the length of the Galveston model spanned 26 miles versus 800 ft for Rip Rap. Beyond studying only water velocities as in the preliminary model, researchers wished to observe projected changes in salinity concentrations which resulted from deepening and widening the ship channels. Lastly, the one-year simulation, generating data at every hour, produced a much higher volume of data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Translation Issues</head><p>The added complexity of the Galveston Bay model demanded modificatioqs to the original translator to support the additional element types. FEMMPGS did not support 13-node pyramid elements; hence, a modification to the first-phase translator entailed treating this element type as a degenerate case of a 15-node pentagonal element. Also, due to the much higher volume of data generated, researchers wished to selectively translate and view particular data subsets of interest. The structured binary format of the data files prevented direct access to specific subsets of the data. Modifications to the first-phase translator addressed this limitation and allowed the researchers to specify ranges of time steps from which to convert data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Viewing Galveston Bay in MPGS</head><p>Once translation issues were resolved, efforts focused on obtaining the model geometry. As expected, the disparity between the z dimension and the x-y dimensions caused the initial geometry to appear twodimensional with no evidence of three-dimensional elements. A scaling factor of approximately 150 in the z dimension adequately exhibited the threedimensionality of the model. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows the scaled grid.</p><p>Initial viewing of the scalar results in MPGS showed salinity concentrations to be higher in the ship channel. This conformed to fundamental knowledge re-  <ref type="figure">6</ref> . ) Academicians and industry experts familiar with the bay provided further validation of the scalar results. These bay area specialists agreed that the behavior of salinities in the visualization corresponded with direct observations of the bay. For example, as physically observed, water surrounding the east side of an island in the bay, Atkinson Island, appeared fresher in the visualization than water surrounding the west side. Beyond simply verifying model behavior, the visualization yielded information difficult , if not impossible, to discern through static images. By viewing changes in salinity over time, the researchers recognized the need for more 3D elements in the model and a finer mesh in certain areas. In particular, the initial model ignored the Galveston jetties located around the southern end of the bay, smoothing them to a constant level. The animation of changing salinities revealed that smoothing the jetties had pushed salinities downstream and decreased them to levels below those of collected field data. Subsequent refinements to the model eliminated this irregularity.</p><p>Visualization of velocity data corroborated expected results fairly early in the investigation. Emphasis of the investigation then shifted to viewing scalar data. Researchers are currently returning focus to observing velocity data with particular emphasis on net tidal drift.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Conclusions</head><p>Working cooperatively with the visualization center, the hydraulics engineers discovered a tool for visualizing numerical models which met and in some instances, exceeded their requirements. First, MPGS proved effective for daily analysis; offering diverse techniques for viewing the data, the software could both verify existing knowledge and reveal irregularities in the model which could not be detected by previous means. Further, the gains afforded by such a versatile analytical tool greatly offset efforts required to input data to the model. Of final significance, the software furnished a useful tool for presentations to sponsors via animated videos.</p><p>The visualization center benefitted from the cooperative endeavor as well. Specifically, the project enabled the center to cultivate expertise in visualization software widely applicable to WES research. It also presented an opportunity to extend and refine the set of tools accompanying the software. More generally, the project increased the center's exposure to the visualization requirements of research conducted at WES.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Initial efforts to view Rip Rap within MPGS indicated the need for scaling data along the z axis of the model. Once the geometry was obtained, emphasis shifted to viewing water velocities, a task for which MPGS afforded numerous techniques. The first technique applied, vector plots, exhibited the magnitude and direction of the water velocities. (Refer toFigure 3.) Next, shaded contour surfaces over the entire grid displayed the behavior of the velocities in an overall sense. (Refer to Figure 4.) Subsequently, more advanced techniques applied to velocities included profiles constructed at crosssections throughout the model from various combinations of the x, y, and z velocity components. The velocity profiles enabled researchers to actually observe the helical flow of the water as it moved around the bends of the test facility. (Refer to Figure 5 . ) An additional technique provided by MPGS for viewing vector data, particle tracing, permits the user to trace the path of a particle moving in the flow field. The static particle path trace shows velocities in ideal circumstances, neglecting resistance due to gravity and friction. The technique proved useful to the investigation by highlighting differing flow regimes: particles in faster flow regimes near the center and top surface could be observed surpassing particles in slower flow regimes near the boundaries.
