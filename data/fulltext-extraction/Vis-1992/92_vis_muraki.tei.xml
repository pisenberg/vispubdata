				<p>A method is presented to obtain a unique shape description of an object b y using wavelet transforms. Wavelet transform is a new signal analysis technique which decomposes a signal using a family of functions having a local property in both time and frequency domains. A multiresolution expression of 3D volume data was first obtained by applying 3D orthogonal wavelet transforms, with the shape then being approximated with a relatively small number of 3D orthogonal functions using only the significant functions. I n addition, the resolution of the approximation can be varied point by point using the local property of the wavelets. The method is applied t o real volume data, i.e., facial range data and M R images of a human head, and typical results are shown.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>To realize computer object recognition, threedimensional (3D) object information must be obtained, with conventional computer vision techniques, such as stereo matching and laser range scanning, providing this information in the form of range images. To analyze the context of a range image, it is necessary to transform it into some kind of symbolic shape description. <ref type="bibr">[l,</ref> 2, 3, 4, 51 However, in order t o handle a range image using symbolic processing, the range data must be significantly compressed or converted into a hierarchical expression since it is constructed from a multitude of numeric values.</p><p>In previous work 61, a range image approximation (Blobby model) 6, 7, 8 , 91 was used t o feasibly apnumber of primitives. However, the nonlinear problem of fitting a Blobby model to the range data required immense calculation time and only provided a local solution, and therefore we corId not obtain a unique shape description of the give.1 range data. Even though a unique shape description of a 3D object was previously accomplished usin,; an orthogonal series such as a Fourier series <ref type="bibr">[lO]</ref> or by spherical liarmonics <ref type="bibr">[ll]</ref>, these expressions were iccomprehensible to human perception; thus not being suitable as a shape description method for a 3D object. Furthermore, these shape description methods were not able to approximate volume data containing inside in-by a hierarchical vo I umetric shape description model proximate an o b ject's shape with a relatively small formation of the object. Because of the wide use of computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance MR) techniques, volume data has recently been han-6 led usin a common 3D expression method (polygons or boxel$, however, the enormous size of this data makes it difficult to computer process. An efficient method to compress volume data without losing the object's fundamental shape is therefore desired. This led t o the present paper which proposes a method t o approximate volume data with 3D functions using wavelet transforms.[l2, 13, 141 Wavelet transforms constitute a new technique for signal analysis, i.e., decomposing a signal on a family of functions having a local property in both time and frequency domains. By applying 3D orthogonal wavelet transforms to a volume data, we can express any 3D object as a summation of orthogonal functions (scaling functions and wavelets); thereby enabling a multiresolution expression[l4] of the object to be made. Hence if we use only the significant fuiictions, we can smoothly approximate the object's shape using a relatively small number of functions without spoiling the fundamental shape. The multiresolution expression in conjunction with the local property of the wavelets provides comprehensible images for human perception and is suitable for use as an object shape description method. In addition, the resolution of the approximation can be varied point by point using the local property of the wavelets.</p><p>In the presented shape description method, surface patches and voxels, which were previously the main elements used in computer graphics to express a complex object, are not utilized. Instead, we apply 3D wavelet transforms t o real volume data, and then show the method's efficiency to describe 3D shapes.</p></div>

The notation of A will subsequently denote the lcurier transform. Here A2, is the operator which approximates a signal a t a resolution 21, where A$ f and D2, f are respectively as called the dzscrete approximalion and discrete detazl szgnal of f(z) a t the resolution 23. By successively applying the same operation to Ai,f, we can obtain a nzullzresolutzoii expression of f ( x ) . Although we can also reconstruct the discrete approximation A$+1 f from Ai,f and 0 2 , f by using a similar filtering operation, the purpose of this paper is to approximate a 3D object by smooth functions; hence we use the inverse transform of continuous form as   <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>(e) is the continuous approximation A; f which is reconstrccted from the first term of (7), and figure 3(f is the continuous apterm of (7) to A t f . It is clearly seen that the detail of the signal Aff, which is lost after it degrades into Ad f , is conserved in the detail signal D+ f , To obtain figures 3(e) and 3(f), we need the continuous functions + ( r ) and $(z), however, these functions are only defined in the frequency domain as (3) and (4). Consequently, we approximate the smooth functions by cubic spline interpolations of discrete va!cles which are calculated from numeric inverse Fouiim transforms. Since the present paper's objective is to use an orthonormal wavelet basis as a primitive of a 3D shape description method, the 1D wavelet theory which was explained in section 2 must be extended into three dimensions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Application to MR Images</head><p>Another application example used a series of 115 slices of magnetic resonance (MR) images (figure 10).

Since it is very important to show the inside structure of volume data in cases of MR imaging volume data, an image showing the cross sections with two planar surfaces was made as shown in figure ll(b). When the volume value of a point, a t which the ray intersected with the planer surface, exceeded the threshold value T, a color corresponding to the volume value was given to the point. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure ll</ref>(c-f) shows subsequent changes in image quality as the number of the functions increase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>We have shown that one can approximate an object's shape with a relatively small number of 3D functions by applying wavelet transforms to the volume data. In this shape description method, a complicated object can be expressed without using the concepts of surface patches and voxels; previously indispensable elements for conventional volume visualization methods. A multiresolution expression of the object was also obtained; thereby enabling future analysis of the object's structure. By sorting the functions in order of their significance, a good approximation in proportion t o the number of functions is obtained. The local property of the wavelets was useful to change the resolution of the expression point by point. By using these properties, it is expected that an efficient method can be developed to transport volume data via computer networks, i.e., a rough approximation can be initially sent, followed by obtaining enhanced to the functions of figure 8 a). As expected, only t 6 e area around the left ear is 8 nely approximated.  details a t selected places. A psychological volume data compression method which emphasizes t specific place on an image, e.g., the eyes on a face, may also be possible.</p><p>It is realized our presented hlR imag-; (isosurfaces and cross sections) do not adequately sliow the inside information of the volume; hence research is being focused on developing a better expression method. In the presented method, the volume value of the object is expressed as a 3D function; thus the gradient of the volume value can easily be analytically obtained and will be useful in various future rendering methods. Further, reconstruction of discrete voxel data from the presented description is very systematically performed by the inverse filtering operation of figure 4. This subsequently allows conventional voxel based volume visualization techniques[l7] to be applied to our shape descriptions.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>2 , ) 3 E~</head><label>23</label><figDesc>be a multiresolution approximation of L2(R).
