				<p>W e describe a project in the field of computational electrocardiology which requires visualization of complex, three-dimensional geometry and electric potential and current fields. Starting from magnetic resonance images from a healthy subject, we constructed a multisurfaced model of the human thorax, which we used as the basis for computational studies relating potential distributions measured from the surface of the heart to potentials and currents throughout the volume of the thoraz (a f o r m of the forward problem in electrocardiography). Driven by the lack of adequate visualization software, we developed both interactive and batch-mode graphics programs to view, manipulate, and interactively edit the model geometry and present our results.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>At rest, each cell of the heart maintains a potential difference (60-90 mV) between its interior and the surrounding space. To initiate the heartbeat, each cell in turn is stimulated, the membrane suddenly becomes permeable to charge-carrying ions, and the potential difference momentarily breaks down (depolarization). Since different regions of the heart are depolarized at different times, there are moments when bulk potential differences arise between regions, resulting in currents which flow outside the cells, and even outside the heart into the surrounding tissues. The reflection of this electrical activity on the surface of the body is the electrocardiogram, or ECG. One of the goals of basic and applied research in cardiology is to analyze this electrical activity, and to model the relationships between the heart, as current source, and the resulting distribution of electric potential on the surface of the thorax.</p><p>One obstacle to investigating cardiac electrical activity is evaluating the immense amounts of data that are produced from both actual measurements and computer simulations. If we take the example of displaying the distribution of voltages on the surface of the thorax, called "body surface potential mapping", or BSPM, data are collected from 32-400 sites at rates of 500-2000 samples/sec for at least a single heartbeat, about 1 s, In the first reported study of BSPM in humans <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>, recording sites were scanned sequentially, the individual ECG tracings photographed from an oscilloscope, and the voltage values measured by hand from enlargements. For each of 10-50 instants in the heartbeat, the voltage was written on a twodimensional projection of the thorax geometry, and equipotential contours drawn by hand. The advent of modern computers has promoted a drastic improvement in our ability to deal with large amounts of data, and to produce graphical output from our experiments and calculations. In step with this, the duration of the recordings and complexity of the data has also increased so that the almost permanent state of affairs is that our ability to process and view the results of ezperiments or computations lags behind our ability to conceive of ever larger and more complex projects.</p><p>In this paper, we describe two systems that we have developed to visualize both experimental and computer simulation data from electrical activity in the human thorax originating from the heart. One of these systems is an interactive program, written with the aim of viewing large amounts of data as rapidly, and with as much flexibility, as possible. The second system represents a batch-mode approach to visualization, in which the goal was to produce high quality images of selected sets of data for use in presentation and publication of our results. The application of these systems has extended beyond our original purpose of viewing measured data from BSPM st,udies The major factors driving the design of the interactive visualization tools included maximizing interactive performance in order to manipulate large finite element meshes and multiple, multichannel data sets, while sacrificing elaborate shading and lighting features. The batch mode graphics were developed to generate the high quality rendered images for subsequent animation and publication of results. This combination of visualization programs has allowed us to generate and manage some of the most complex and elaborate models of the human thorax used in this field, and to produce uniquely revealing images of our results. Although the costs of developing the code ourselves were significant, this has allowed us to maintain full control over the visualization process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The software Problem description</head><p>To outline the design and functionality of the visualization software, we take as our example the construction of a multi-component, three-dimensional model of the human thorax, and its use in studies in computational electrocardiography. The goal of this research was to solve what are known as the forward and inverse problems of electrocardiography. In its most useful formulation, the forward solution seeks to predict potential and current distributions in the t h e rax and on the body surface, given the voltages on the outer, or epicardial, surface of the heart; the inverse solutions starts with measured body surface potentials and predicts heart and thorax potential (and current) distributions. Mathematically, this means solving Laplace's equation in an inhomogeneous, irregular volume, which can be achieved numerically, using either a boundary element or finite element approach. The boundary element method requires a description of just the surfaces that make up the geometry, but it cannot realistically include anisotropic tissue conductivities; the finite element method provides direct computation of volume potentials, allows the inclusion of anisotropy, but requires discretization of the entire volume.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Constructing the model</head><p>The basis of our model geometry was a set of nuclear magnetic resonance images, recorded at 5-mm spacing from a healthy subject, which were transferred to a Macintosh I1 for display and manual digitization of the surfaces that separated different organs <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The digitized points from one image formed what we called a "layer" and were interpolated by surface USing a parametric bicubic spline approximation. We then joined points from neighboring pairs of layers into three-dimensional "slices" and connected points from the same surface into triangular elements. After concatenating and sorting all the points by surface, we constructed complete triangularized descriptions of each surface in the thorax. The automated triangularization, which often represents a significant stumbling block when constructing meshes of this sort, was simplified immensely by taking advantage of the fact that the nodes were stratified in separate planes (layers). As long as points in each layer were properly ordered, joining them to form triangles was reduced to "lacing", a task which consists of comparing the lengths of the diagonals of the triangles formed when each of two possible unattached points are joined with the last linked pair. With some modifications to account for initial point alignment and situations in which there was a jump in the number of points in neighboring layers, this algorithm produced acceptable, but not always complete, triangularizations.</p><p>The task in terms of visualization was then to be able to view and interactively edit the results of the automatic triangularization, both on a slice-by-slice basis, and once the entire surface was generated. This required that the user be able to rotate and translate the image of the object interactively, and more importantly, that it be possible to remove and reconstruct individual triangles, and move points within the confines of their layer. The original software for these tasks was written in FORTRAN either for the Evans and Sutherland PS-390, or using the Tektronix Plot-10 library. We have since ported these programs to C, and expanded their features using the Graphics Language (GL) library from Silicon Graphics. Hardware platforms include both Silicon Graphics 4D and IBM RS/SOOO workstations.</p><p>In order to complete the model for the FEM computations, we went back to the planar layers. After filling the space between surface outlines with a regular grid of points, we again paired adjacent layers to form three-dimensional slices, and tessellated the complete point set into tetrahedral volume elements which are optimal in the sense of Delaunay tessellation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The geometry viewing program described above was capable of visualizing the tetrahedral connectivity, although the result was only really useful for single slices, simply due to the number of line segments created during tetrahedraliiation. To more rigorously evaluate the tetrahedralization, we checked each tetrahedral element against minimum and maximum volume criteria, and removed any elements whose centroid, or any segmental midpoint, lay outside the volume defined by the bounding surface points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Viewing surface data</head><p>The measured input data for the forward and inverse solutions, as well as many of the results, take the form of potential distributions on fixed surfaces. One way to visualize data of this sort in.an easily interpreted form is to superimpose either contours or colorcoded surfaces over the (three-dimensional) model geometry itself <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. Additional requirements of the display programs included the ability to quickly manipulate the geometry and data, to step through series of several thousand individual data sets, and to offer flexible scaling possibilities. We incorporated all of this functionality into one program, which allowed us to view both geometry and data from multiple surfaces, each surface placed in its own window, or sharing a window with as many other surfaces as memory allowed.</p><p>We simplified many of the complex and timeconsuming issues of the user interface development, by choosing to use a rather long list of UNIX-style command line arguments to specify much of the data needed to start the program (file names, color configurations, window locations, etc.). While this made manual initiation of the program somewhat cumbersome, we felt that through the use of shell scripts, or even separate programs that would interrogate the user and then either construct the script or invoke the graphics program itself, any level of user comfort could be achieved. Once the program was running, program control occurred via single-keystroke commands, or mousedriven menus. The GL pop-up menu facilities are well suited to this simple interface design and allowed the quick addition of sub-menus or new commands as the code evolved. Manipulation of the geometry, clipping planes, and scaling occurred via a dial box, with the mouse serving as a second, and much less precise, means of rotating, translating, and scaling. The keyboard arrow keys controlled which surfaces and data sets were displayed.</p><p>Flexible and robust scaling methods are crucial for viewing data from biological sources. The scientist-user must be able to experiment with a wide assortment of scale models and modes, including whatever 'standard' ones already exist for the particular field. In our applications we divided scaling into several facets:</p><p>Shading or contouring We implemented only simple shading models (Gourard and flat shading) in order to maximize interactive performance. The controlling parameters were the number of separate colors and contour levels desired.</p><p>Color M a p The desire to conform with existing standards for viewing potential distributions in cardiology, resulted in the following color maps:</p><p>Red to Green Largest negative values were coloured bright green, grays were used for the region near zero, and positive values appeared red.</p><p>Red to Blue Colours ranged from dark blue (for negative extrema) through greens (near zero) to red (positive extrema).</p><p>Red and Green Red was positive and green negative, with no gradation with value (useful only for contour maps).</p><p>Gray scales : From black to white (or white to black) with increasing data values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scale Scope</head><p>The scope of the scaling determined which values were used to derive the scale factors.</p><p>In global scope, all values in the entire data set were used, even those not presently visible in the display, with the same scaling applied to each.</p><p>In local scaling, only the data presently visible were scanned for extrema, and the scale factors could be different for each data set. The user scaling scope used the current user-selected values for maximum and minimum for the scaling of all data sets.</p><p>Scale Model The scale model describes the way in which data are mapped to colors. The basic models mapped the data to a range of colours in a linear, logarithmic, or exponential fashion. Two additional schemes employed fixed numbers of contours, log/7-levels and log/lPlevels, to map the upper decade ( q 5 , , , to 4ma,/10.) of the data range into a fixed set of logarithmically spaced values. These values were composed of a mantissa from the standard E6 (1.0, 1. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">5, 2.2, 3.3, 4.7,   6</ref>.8, and 10.) and E12 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8, 2.2,</ref> 2.7, 3.3, 3.9, 4.7, 5.6, 6.8, 8.2, and 10.) number series, and an base-ten exponent such that the largest mantissa fell into the range 1.0 to 10. The principle behind schemes such as this it to allow quantitative evaluation of contour lines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scale Mapping This parameter reflected different</head><p>ways to manage the way positive and negative values were treated in the scaling transformations. The symmetric scale mapping set the positive and negative extrema symmetrically; the larger (in the absolute value sense) determined both maximum and minimum data values (and hence, the scale factor), In the separate scale mapping, on the other hand, the positive and negative extrema were treated completely separately: 'half' the colours (and contours) were used for the positive values, half for the negative values. The third scale mapping was the simplest, straight mapping, in which half the colours were used for data below the mean, half for data above the mean. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows an example of the interactive display of the torso model, with potential distributions overlaid as a set of equipotential contour lines. The points which define the torso surface are included to supply a visual reference to the shape, the contour lines are color-coded (in Red to Blue mode). Two copies of the same geometry are used, rotated such that both anterior (right-hand side) and posterior (left-hand side) views are provided, and clipping planes have been applied to hide the 'far' side of each torso. In normal operation, a single copy would be displayed, which the user could then rotate, translate and otherwise manipulate to view the distribution. The orthogonal axis system shows the 'standard' body coordinates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Window layout</head><p>The high resolution monitors of current graphics workstations are excellent for photographic production of hard copy. We routinely generate slides and prints for presentations and publications with nothing more than a 35-mm camera and a tripod in a darkened room. The ability to easily create composite images was a feature we wished to realize with our software. While most windowing systems allow relocation and resizing of windows, they also display some sort of frame around each window, which is distracting when viewed out of the context of the computer screen. The GL software allows windows to be drawn without borders, but once laid out, they cannot be altered. We defined command line arguments which specified windows with or without borders, and further allowed the size and location of each window to be pre-set. With a minimum of experimentation, we had little problem composing displays with multiple, separate windows which met exactly and photographed well. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows an example of such a composite image, actually the result of two separate invocations of the program and three separate windows. The lower panel contain anterior (right-hand side) and posterior (left-hand side) views of the surface of the ventricles of the heart. The shading of the surfaces represents the potential distribution, using Gouraud shading and the Red to Green mode, while the (only partially visible) numbers indicate measurement electrode locations from the data recording. The potential distribution shown in this figure was used to compute the data shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> via the forward solution, with the particular instant in time indicated in the by the vertical line in the electrocardiogram shown in the upper panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Viewing currents</head><p>A novel feature of our modeling work is the computation of current density throughout the human thorax, originating either from the heart, or from defibrillation electrodes. The visualization of vector fields is, therefore, also new to our field, and consequently completely without a standard form of display. Within the context of the interactive software, our visualization scheme displayed vector fields as arrows of unit length which were oriented along the local vector direction, and whose shafts were color-coded according to the local vector magnitude. With scaling transformations applied to the vector amplitude (shaft color), this permitted qualitative evaluation of amplitude and direction of the field, at least as long as we could smoothly rotate the display to view it from different angles. In cases in which the density of vectors was high enough to slow the interactive motion, or individual vectors became difficult to resolve, we applied averaging and drew only a single vector for each region. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> shows a display of the current distribution in a single slice of the torso model, with the epicardial surface, shaded according to potential distribution, inserted for reference. Vectors are indicated by the normalized arrows inside the slice, with the leading edge of the arrow colored white, and the shaft coded according to current density amplitude.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Batch-mode graphics</head><p>The limits of interactive visualization usually represent a trade off between response time and complex-ity of the image, especially when features like hidden surface removal, lighting, and surface texturing are concerned. While we used state of the art graphics hardware to view our data (Silicon Graphics 4D/210 VGX), we elected to stay with as simple a rendering model as possible in order to maximize interactive performance. Once the geometrical model was constructed, calculations run, and simulation data had been scanned for best results, we wanted to produce high quality images for animation, reproduction, and publication. To this end, we utilized elements from the "IBM visualization system", which was developed by one of the authors (M.M.). This software also uses the GL programming interface, although some display routines also work under the "Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System" (PHIGS), and its X-windows implementation, PEX. The complete system included a database manager for the consistent handling of a variety of input data types and computers, an interface manager which controlled feedback to programs, a visualization manager which was responsible for the creation of all images, and an animation manager used to create animated sequences. In order to make efficient use of decentralized computational resources, the IBM system was designed to function using shared memory and distributed systems.</p><p>Individual images were created by either a high performance polygon renderer, named 'HiPPR', or an integrated ray tracer/volume renderer, which we named 'RaySpray'. Common illumination models such as flat, Gouraud, and Phong were supported as well as numerous features for texture and environmental mapping, and motion blur. Typical image generation times for the model of the human torso ranged from on the order of a minute of CPU for HiPPR, to just under an hour for RaySpray, on an IBM RS/6000-530 Workstation. Rendering of isosurfaces and current loops was performed by constructing the polygons of the desired surfaces and then passing them to the visualization manager of the IBM visualization system.</p><p>The disadvantage of ray tracing is the high p r e cessing cost that is incurred. In an attempt to minimize computer time in this application, we distributed the rendering engine among workstations using a custom socket library interface. A "voxe1"-based method, which maintained information concerning the spatial positions of objects within the scene, further reduced the time spent on computing ray and object intersections. The greatest advantage of ray tracing is that this single methodology solves the problems of removing hidden surfaces, computing the shading due to direct and global illumination, and calculating the shad-ows.</p><p>We used the IBM visualization system to generate multiple lighted, surface textured views of the torso geometry for production of a computer animation describing the model construction. From the results of simulations of the forward solution, surfaces of constant potential were extracted and rendered using similar color models to those used in the interactive graphics software, and current loops were computed by integrating from seed points along the local vector directions and displayed as shaded cylinders. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 5-6</ref> are all examples of batch-mode graphics, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref> showing the same slice as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>, but with the epicardial surface shaded red and currents extending in continuous loops through the whole torso. The tetrahedral mesh and the current loops have been drawn as sets of cylinders, and the image has been rendered using light sources and ray tracing. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> is the rendered analog of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> and the upper panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>, showing the same potential distribution on the anterior and posterior views of the torso surface. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> suggests some of the varied possibilities that exist for displaying results under the batch-mode, image based paradigm. The figure is a composite of a view of the torso surface (top panel of the cube), a combination of torso surface and lungs and epicardium (lower, left-hand panel), and the current distribution for a single instant in time throughout the entire torso (lower, right-hand panel).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D is cuss ion</head><p>At some point in the development of visualization software, one is inevitably asked whether the result was worth the effort, and why existing packages did not meet the needs of (in our case) the biomedical researcher. Without digressing into a review of the graphics software that was available at the time this project began, we have found that only by writing and maintaining our own visualization programs have we been able to fulfill all our needs adequately. While there are inevitably features of new packages that appear more elegant and simpler to use, there rarely exists a program that contains all of the desirable features simultaneously. Another important characteristic of the scientific software user is that if the program provides fast, useful views of a researcher's data, then almost any user interface will be tolerated and learned. The third factor that supports at least a partial do-it-yourself approach is the requirement that scientific software be extensible and adaptable. While the cost of developing original code is significant, programs that are rigid and completely sealed from the user, even if they do as much as 80% of what is required, may prove nearly useless in real applications The issues of flexibility and expandibility become especially apparent in the area of data scaling and display format. The scientist/user is often accustomed to certain 'standard' arrangements and scaling schemes and can be overwhelmed by a complex (and infinitely variable) scaling system that allows, for example, each color component to be altered in completely nonlinear, and usually irreproducible, ways. We have chosen an approach which starts with accepted presentation paradigms in our field, but allows modest interactive tuning and adjusting of parameters. Important also is some form of calibration of the scaling parameters to allow a quantitative evaluation of the data. Schemes for interactive display and control of data scaling models, and techniques for probing the data by incorporating "picking" to report absolute data values, are areas of our ongoing investigation and development.</p><p>The newest generation of data-flow paradigm programs offer a structure that may prove very useful in scientific visualization. While our experience to date is still limited, we are optimistic that by combining existing modules with those we can write ourselves, we will be able to create useful and flexible visualization applications with elegant user interface support. Questions still to be answered include whether adequate levels of interactive performance can be maintained for the large data sets that scientists currently generate and whether the level of programming skills required to write custom modules remains manageable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The suite of programs described here has considerably enhanced our ability to construct threedimensional, geometric models and visualize the results of simulations of cardiac electrical activity in the human thorax. In retrospect, it is difficult to imagine how one would manage models of this size and complexity without the assistance of sophisticated graphics tools. Such advanced visualization has also allowed us to reveal details of our data that were previously hidden. For example, to our knowledge, the displays of the closed current loops in the torso model are the first such images to appear in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The fact that we have developed the code ourselves also ensures that further development can, and no doubt will, occur as needs dictate. Although the design and implementation reflect our specific needs, many problems of this type exist in our field and related areas in which threedimensional mesh construction and display of potential and current fields are required.     </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>[ 2 ]</head><label>2</label><figDesc>to in-clude the display and editing of complex geometrical models of the human thorax [3, 41, and most recently, to visualization of results from three-dimensional simulations of voltage and current distributions [5, 6, 71.</figDesc></figure>
