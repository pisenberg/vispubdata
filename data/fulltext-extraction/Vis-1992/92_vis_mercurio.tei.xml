				<p>ZXs case study looks at the issues involved in operating a sophisticated scientifi instrument as a computer peripheral accessible over a high-speed network. A custom intcractive visualization application was constructed to support investigation using a unique computer-controlled high voltage electron microscope. The researcher&apos;s workstation forms the visible third of a triumvirate, with the instrument and the compute resource comprising the other two parts. The somare was designed to support not only image acquisition, but also many of the tasb that microscope researchers perfbrm in analyzing images. The result of this case study is the identification of some of the issues regarding interacting with scientijic instrumentation over high-speed networh and the construction of custom applications to support many of the tasks within a laboratory&apos;s research metMlogy.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In scientific investigations, visualization is often performed as a separate process following data acquisition. Even when interactive tools are employed, they are usually applied as a separate process after the experiments have been completed and the data has been manipulated in a farm suitable for tbe visualization programs. FIcCo871 <ref type="bibr">[Banc891 [phi1891 [Habe901 DvBO]</ref>. In this case study we describe the Microscopist's Workstation (MWS) project, whicb we have prototVped for presentation as part of the SIGGRAPH '92 Showcase. The SDMIR microsoope is a unique resource. By building an application around it, we hope to achieve two ends. Our primary result' will be to extend the capabilities of the microscope. In studying researchers using the microscope, we have found that electron microscopes are subsequent analysis. Although the SDMIR microscope is equipped for digital image acquisition, the images are still analyzed off-line, away from the miaoscope. We hope to mate a synergy between interactive visualization techniques and a sophisticated scientific instrument by providing tools for image compositing, comparison, and morpbometria, and by enhancing, via s t e q s i s and computed tomography, the microscopist's perception of three-dimensional structures during the data collection process at the microscope. The result is a more powerful investigative tool.</p><p>Our secondary goal is to extend access to the microscope. The Microscopist's Workstation software is designed to be used either in the same m m as the microscope or at a remote site, via a high-speed network. 'Ibe software is also designed to be used e i t k with the microscope on-line, or independent of the microscope, when the m i m m p e is not available or necessaty for a particular task. 2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Distributed Laboratory</head><p>The Mimmpist's Workstation project is a collaborative effort between seveml research sites in San Diego: the San Diego Supercomputer Center, the UCSD Computer Science department and Medical School, and the ScripPS Research Institute. Each institution is supplying hardware, networking, software development, and design expertise towards the project. One of the immediate spin-offs of this c o l " * has been the installation of higher-speed network connections between all of the sites.</p><p>The on-going collaboratim and discussions among the sites have lead us to begin to conceptualize a Distributed used as cameras, to colleu data photographically for Laboratory, one that employs high-speed networks to integrate data acquisition, computational resources, v i s u a l i n , and communication into a seamless, geographically distributed investigative environment. "he concept of a Distributed Laboratory leads to many areas of possible investigation, three of which are addressed by the Miaoscpist's Workstation project: integrating a scientific insaument into the computing environment, seamless management of supercomputing resource, and multi-user collaboration.</p><p>Constructing an environment that accesses an insuument as a computer peripheral allows the device to be used by a researchef at a remote site with nearly the same efficiency as is available to an on-site researcher, distributing the facility spaially. If the investigative software also operates both with the instrument on-lii and with it off-line, either independent of the instrument or with the instrument available for OccaSional "batch" processing, the facility is also distributed temporally. The result is the multiplication of single resources.</p><p>In order to present to the researcher a unified investigative environment, the management of computing resources must be automatic. Our experience with the NetV software [Elvi91], which transparently distributes volume rendering tasks to high-end rendering resources, is a first step towards hiding the computing power behind the interface. In the M W S project, the workstation interface is the visible third of a triumvirate, the computer-conmlled microscope and the supercomputing fesou~ces comprising the remaining, hidden, portions (See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1)</ref>.</p><p>Focusing on bringing distributed data acquisition and computational resources to the workstation user interface allows that interface to be replicated among multiple researchers. This czeates a collaborative research environment wherein two or more researchers can interact with each other and the instrument</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3</head><p>The SDMIR Electron Microscope SDMIR was developed to support scientific research focused on relating biological function to structure using state of the art computer imaging and electron microscopy. 'his instrument, a JEOL 4O0OEX, can employ a higher acceleration voltage (up to 4OOKV) than a conventional TEM (100KV). The higher accelerating voltage makes possible penetration and imaging of thicker specimens, up to 3 microns, compared to 0.1-0.25 microns in the conventional TEM. One focus of research at SDMIR is on the development of computer-assisted metbods for deriving and exploring the three-dimensional structure residing in these thick Sections [Hess921[Ca1~911. Because the HVEM has a very large depth of field, the image it forms is an orthogonal projection of the section. The depth dimension is lost. However, it is possible to regain this dimension by obtaining images from different angles of view either by tilting the electron beam relative to the specimen or by mechanically tilting the specimen. In the simplest use of this principle, a stereo pair of images m a y be derived. Io amoresophisEicatedapproarhequivalent to tbat used in computet-assisted tomography (CAT), a three dimensional volume of densities is derived froan a wries of images cdected by successively tilting the specimen in small inaementS about an axis. This axial tomography procedure requires image processing to achieve p p e r alignment of the tilt series, and computationally intensive interad via Rs232 lines with the CAPKON, a Sun Microsystems SPARcstatioo 2 with several special purpose periphetals. CAPKON also interbces to an image processor which can acquire microscope images from both a real rime 512x512 8-bit video camera and a high resoIutioll1024x1024 14-bit slow scan amled CCD camera. Processed images may be viewed on a monitor at the micmcope. In addition to providing views with better contrast than t h e seen by direct viewing at the mimscupe* the image pmcesor may be used to display capabilities make possible the design of the Miaoscopist's WorksMtion.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">M W S Network Nodes</head><p>Tbe primary application running on the M W S is GridBmwser, which supports the display, measurement, and analysis of a large mosaic bitmap of the specimen (grid) loaded into themiaompe. Fora 2" grid, a 5K x 5K mosaic is conshucted, comprised of 0.w square pixels. To facilitate interactive browsing of the data, reduced versions of tbe mosaic are also computed, at several different resolutions, the smallest being a 512 x 5 12 pixel image.</p><p>GridBrowser communicates with a number of other applications (nodes on tbe M W S network) via remote procedure calls W s ) . There are two levels of M W S nodes supporting GridBrowser. The application at the lowest level is Capcon, the microscope control and image caphue process running on the dedicated CAP/CDN worksration. Also running on CAPKON are two nodes which invoke capcon's services to capture sets of images and process them far display.</p><p>Survey is responsible for aligning multiple raw images gatbered from Capcon to construct a mosaic. The initial 5K x 5K recopding of a specimen is gathered in advance by Survey, which is also running while the user is on-line with the microscope. The M W S user can request a higher-magni6cation mosaic of an a m being viewed using GridBrowser. To service this request, Survey skuis by capturing and transmitting the central tile of the mosaic, then captures and aligns tiles srnrounding the center in a roughly spiral pattan, transmitting eacb to GridBrowser as it is completed. The process may be intempted by the user at any time.</p><p>TheMWSalsointegratesthemicroscope'stomography capability into the microscope environment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">MWS Sof'tware Architecture</head><p>Tbe RFCs for all of the MWS nodes are assembled into the NetMan (network management) libary, to facilitate the d o n of new nodes and the propagation of changes in the NetMan protocol to all of the nodes. We made a small modification to the RPC code gene"</p><p>to enable the NetMan library to contain both the client and server functions for each node. 'Ibis allows each node to act as a client employing the services of another instance of itself.</p><p>For example, this is used by multiple GridBrowsers running on different workstations to interoperate in support of collaborative work.</p><p>AU of the MWS applications were built using the XView toolkit, and were designed using Sun's DevGUIDE user interface development tool. GridBrowser uses Sun's Sunvision image processing library to manipulate and display images. It also uses Sun's Slingshot extensions to tbe XView toolkit to handle the drawing of graphics overlays. As a result, GridBrowser was implemented without any coding at the X Windows library level. We have found that relying on higher-level toolkits like W i w and Sunvision has sped our development time significantly. lTvkn.9 11 User interface events in an XView application are disjmtched via a portion of XView called the Notifier. Event handling is implemented via callback functions that are associated with user interface widgets. A function is provided within the Notilier to enable the handling of</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RFCS.</head><p>All of the dispatch functions, client functions, and dummy versions of the service functions for the applications are compiled into the NetMan library, so a programmer working on an MWS node need only implement the code for each of the service functions. However, the dynamics of Rpcs and the needs of our application require that the service functions return as quickly as possible. For example, GridBrowser shouldn't be suspended waiting for CapCon to capture an image. To achieve the appearance of being multi-thteaded, each of the MWS nodes contains a polling timer set to be activated as often as possible. Tbe function attached to the rimer consists of a simple state machine (a C switch statement) with its state stored as a globally-accessible variable. If an RFC service function needs to perform a task which may take an appreciable amount of rime, it sets an appropriate timer state and returns. The timer function will then perform the operation the next rime it is invoked. If the client node needs to know when the service task is cmplete, a follow-up RFC is issued from the setvice node back to the client. Nodes on the MWS network are thus decoupled. The XMew Notifier guarantees that user interface events, RFCs, and the polling timer are all smoothly integrated, making possible an easily extensible event-based program structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">MWS Implementation</head><p>All of the mimscope beam parameters need to be adjusted to align and focus the image correctly, not only at the start of each session, but also continually, as the microscope is being operated. In order to operate the microscope remotely, a real-time video image of the microscope stage would need to be available to the remote microscopist, in addition to facile control over all of the beam parameters. Any perceivable lags or discontinuities in the video signal or in the transmission of the beam control information would make tuning the parameters extremely difficult [Can921 <ref type="bibr">[Keilgl]</ref>. Since we presently cannot assume the availability of real-time video, the MWS software design is dependent on the presence of an operator at the microscope site, and includes support for interaction between the on-site operator and the remote researcher. Tbe Capcon node, which is responsible for other applications on the network, may fulfill a request by prompting the on-site operator and awaiting acknowledgment that the request has been satisfied. In this way, all responsibility for controlling the microscope and </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>It is a new biology research facility established by the National Center for Researcb Res~lrces of the National Institutes of Health and is located in the Medical School at the University of California, San Diego. The facilities of the laboratory are available to researchers throughout the United States. The central instrument in the lab is a specially designed and equipped transmission electron microscope ('IEM). The TEM has about one thousand times more resolution than a light microscope. A light microscope provides a valuable panoramic view of the paths of nerve fibers from one area of the brain to another and of the jungle of nerve fibers arriving from different Microscopist's Workstation Triumvirate sources in the vicinity of the input sites of a particular nerve cell. However, the resolution of a TEM is requiredto establish which fibers actually fonn contacts or synapses on the neuron as well as the particular farm of the contact.
