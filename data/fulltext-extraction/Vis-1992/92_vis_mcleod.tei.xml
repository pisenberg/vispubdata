			<abstract>
				<p>In recent years, the development of satellite altimetry has opened previously unexplored regions of the world&apos;s oceans to exploration by marine geoscienfists. By correlating sea sutface gravity with seafloor depth, researchers gain insight into the kinematics of seafloor spreading and the physical mechanism by which the seafloor is formed and deformed. Given that the ocean comprises two thirds of the earth&apos;s surjiace, under which lies a vastly unexplored domain, visualization holds the key in isolating regions of exploration and providing an encompassing perspective that can not be achieved in nature. This case study describes the process of seafloor spreading and discusses some of the concerns with visualizing gravitatwnal acceleratwn</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">History</head><p>Although man has studied the earth throughout history, it is only in the past 40 years that we have developed a coherent understanding of the formation and evolution of the planet. The development of sonar during World War I1 made it possible to map the topography of the seafloor and subsequently revealed that it is not the vast, featureless plain that it had been imagined to be. It was the intensive study of the ocean basins in the 1950's and 1960's that provided the crucial pieces of information necessary to develop the hypothesis of plate tectonics thereby explaining workings of the earth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Seafloor Spreading</head><p>One of the fundamental tenets of plate tectonics is the process of seafloor spreading. It is now known that two thirds of the earth's surface is formed by a continuous chain of submarine volcanoes that make up the global </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Problem</head><p>Although the kinematics of seafloor spreading ale very well understood, the dynamics are the subject of a great deal of current research in marine geophysics. The physical mechanism by which the seafloor is formed, deformed and carried away from the ridge axis is not understood. In particular, we do not know why slow spnxdhg ridges have disamtinuous axial valleys and fast spreading ridges have more continuous axial highs.</p><p>Because ridges which spread at intesmediate rates are located in the largely unexplored swthem oceans, the nature of the transition from an axial valley to an axial ridge structure has not been thoroughly studied.</p><p>These studies can be greatly enhanced through the support of the Advanced Scientific Visualization Laboratory, a small facility within the San Diego Supercomputer Center, that specializes in Scientific Visualhation. The San Diego Supercomputer Center not only provides computational power, from a CRAY Y-MP and the Intel iPSU860 and nCUBE 2 parallel a " , but also supports visualization efforts within many scientific, industrial, and commercial fields. aaditional aoalysis of problems, such as tbe dynamics of seafloor spreading, can be extended through more informative and revealing visual simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Satellite Altimetry</head><p>In recent years, the development of satellite altimetry has opened previously unexplored regions of the world's oceans to explaration by marine geoscientists. Satellite altimeters use microwave radar to make extremely detailed maps of the height of the sea surface. In addition to aceanographic effects, such as waves, tides and currents, the shape of the sea surface is determined by the gravitational attraction of structures on and beneath the seafloor. For example, the added mass of a seamount causes water to accumulate around it and form a "bump" on the sea surface above. Because oceanographic effects have longer wavelengths than most topographic features, these effects may be removed by filtering. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Motivation</head><p>Early satellite altimeter missions were limited by a wide track spwing. This imposed a resolution limit on the data ge"tists could obtain far study. However, m</p><p>1985, the U. S. Navy launched the Geosat satellite altimem which collected very high resolution data with a very dense track spacing.</p><p>The Geosat mission accosnplished a complete mapping of the marine gravity field with an approximate resolution of 10 kilometers. Unfortunately, only data south of 60' has been declassied. We are warking with a sub&amp; of this data bcatedbetwe"ewZealandandAntarctica. 'Ihisisone of the previously unexplored segments of the midocean ridge system where an abrupt transition from an axial ridge toan axial Valley structurehasbeendiscovered. This oceanfloor model was designed by first mmfoaming the gravity data into extrusion levels. Next, acolor library ofmaterials was generated by sampling the ambient. diffuse, and spectral elements of the color table from the two dimensional pixelmap. The extrusion data values were then applied to a gridded plane, and by utilizing custom software from the San Diego Supercomputer Center, the three dimensional defdtion of the topology was written to the Wavefront object fonnat with each vertex assigned a height dependent color from the material library. Smootb shading of the topology was generated fran surface IKxmals at each vertex, and blended coloring was achieved through color interpolation algorithms within Wavefront.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Visualization</head><p>The images shown <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 1 and 2 )</ref> are part of a simulae animated "swim through" of the portion of the Geosat data and were generated on a Silcon Graphics 4D/320 VGX using Wavefront Technology's Image renderer. This area is one of the previously unexplored segments of the midocean ridge system where an abrupt transition from an axial ridge to an axial valley structure zones, and a seamount is visible on the right side ( see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 1</ref> ). Also depicted is a closer look down one of the has been discovered. Tbe long, IineaT features are fracture li-acme zones ( see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2)</ref>.</p><p>The motion for the "swim through" was initially scripted from the two dimensional aerial view of the region. Utilizing Wavefront's Preview animation capabilities, critical regions were isolated by specifying "key frames" or preferred camera positions. The motionwas obtained by performing a spline interpolation between the translational and rotational information stored 111. FUTURE</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Limitations</head><p>The integration of advanced visualization techniques with marine geoscience, such as the one outlined h, has only recently developed and given tbe scale of global research performed by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and other facilities, the reliance on technology will only increase. Therefore, the limiting factors of technology in terms of total resources and acc111;1cy must always be considered.</p><p>For example, one of the limitations of this visualization technique involved the s k r size and high resolution of tbe data set. Due to memory considerations and rendering amsrraints, programs needed to be developed to selectively import filtered, low resolution data sections or subsets of the data in order to achieve a tolerable level of user interaction. Although these limitations were conquered, potentially, the management techniques will need to accommodate much more information should furtherdatabecomeavailable.</p><p>Also, in terms of accuracy, it is important to clarify that the surface shown in the generated images is not actually the seafloor but rather a surface of equal gravitatiooal acceleration. The topogtapby of this surface is approximately equivalent to the topography of the seafloor with one hportant difference. The gravity data also contains information about the subsurface structure in this area. The longer Wavelength components of this image are related not only to the seafloor topography but also to density cuntrasts from s m m several kilometem below the seafloor. 'his image appears snoother than the actual seafloor because the signal from the short wavelength features on the seafloor is attenuated by the water depthapproximately tbtee kil-in this area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Conclusion</head><p>The relationship between gravity and topography has been used to study subseafloor strucms in many parts of the world's oceans and is an important area of marine geophysical research. Although scientists need to be aware <ref type="figure">(See color plates, p. CP-43.)</ref> of the limitations of technology, the integration of visualization into this field has great potential. From an utilized in this project can be used for planniig expeditions to remote oceanographic areas. Furthermore, the new perspective this visualization provides to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography reveals the broader relationship of midocean ridges. This helps the world understand how oceanic crust is mated, as well as why spreading ridges have such different structures, thereby eliminating some of life's mysteries.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>midocean ridge system. The oceanic crust, which comprises most of the seafloor andis f m e d from magma at the midocean ridge, subsides as it moves away from the ridge and eventually sinks back into the eartb at deep trenches. The rate the seafloor spreads away from the ridge axis varies geographically from 10 to 180 kilometers per million years. The structure of the ridge axis is determined primarily by the spreading rate. Slow spreading ridges, such as those in the Atlantic and western Indian oceans, are usually marked by rugged flanking topogmphy and a one to three kilometer deep, 20 to 40 kilometer wide, axial valley. Fast spfeading ridges, such as those in the Paciic and eastern Indian oceans, are characterized by smoother flanking topography and a continuous axial ridge which is usually less than one kilometer high. The ridge system is composed of ridge segments, 10 to 500 kilometers long, which are offset by peapeadicular features called transform faults. Transform faults create deep valleys on the seafloor called fracture m e s which preserve a recofd of the offset of the ridge and the motions of continents as they move about the earth's surface. The presence of these transform offsets also seems to be related to spreading rate. Slow spreading ridges usually have shorter ridge segments with more transform offsets while fast spreading ridges are more continuous.</figDesc></figure>
