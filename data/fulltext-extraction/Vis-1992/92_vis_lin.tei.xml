				<p>Visualization for the document space is an important issue for future information retrieval systems. This article describes an information retrieval framework that promotes graphical displays which will make documents in the computer visualirable to the searcher. As examples of such graphical displays, two simulation results of using Kohonen&apos;s feature map to generate map displays for information retrieval are presented and discussed. The map displays are a mapping from a highdimensional document space to a two-dimensional space. They show document relationships by various visual cues such as dots, links, clusters and areas as well as their measurement and spatial arrangement. Using the map displays as an interface for document rerrieval systems, we will provide the user with richer visual information to support browsing and searching.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Visual information plays an important role in human communication and recognition. In their day-to-day life, people are used to information on tangible media stored in visible locations. They employ a whole set of perception and association techniques, in addition to verbal communication techniques, to get information from the environment. However, when information is stored in a computer, it becomes invisible to people. All the clues for visual perception and associations disappear. Access to information in the computer relies on one's ability to generate a good query and the computer's capability to match the user's query to information stored in the database. At best, when interaction is involved, one can modify the query based on the retrieved results of the query. This is like searching for a book in a library without light. One can walk around from stack to stack. He can get a few books each time and walk out of the library to see if the book he is searching for is among them. If not, he has to walk in again to a location where he thinks the book would likely be, based on his knowledge about the library and the experience he has the last time. In this situation, success in finding the book greatly depends on user's ability to walk to the right place (generating a good query), and to adjust his locations until he gets to the right place (interactive query generation).</p><p>Could we tum the light on? Could we make information in the computer visualizable to the user? These are questions that researchers have been seeking for answers since early 1960s when the computer was first used for information retrieval. Doyle once proposed a semantic road map that could serve as "a view of the entire library at a glance" <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>. The view would help the searcher to "narrow his focus by recognition", and then to bring out more and more detail about relevant documents by "microscopes". However, the technology at that time prevented him from implementing and testing his idea further. Today, using advanced computer technology to revive Doyle's idea, we are in a much better position to build a map display that will make both document contents and relationships visualizable to the searcher.</p><p>This article proposes a map display for information retrieval based on Kohonen's feature map, a neural network's self-organizing learning algorithm. The map display is a mapping from a high-dimensional document space to a two-dimensional space. It shows document relationships by various visual cues such as dots, links, clusters and areas as well as their measurement and spatial arrangement. It 'abstracts" the underlying structure of a document space and displays it in a map form. Using the map display as an interface for document retrieval systems, we will provide the user with richer visual information to support browsing and searching. In the following sections, we first describe a framework that promotes graphical displays for information retrieval. Kohonen's feature map is then discussed, and two of its simulated results on visualizing document collections are presented. The final section discusses various types of graphical displays for information retrieval and different types of underlying engines for different types of graphical displays. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> shows two frameworks of information retrieval. The one on the left-hand side describes general characteristics of current retrieval systems. Given a query, typically a Boolean logic expression, the retrieval system searches through the whole database and returns those items that literally match the query. Then the retrieval system displays the search result to the user, usually in a linear form, such as a list of authors or a list of document titles. Within this framework, the "exact match" may be improved by some techniques, like "truncation match", "wild card match", or "proximity match", etc. In any of these cases, the retrieval system generally considers matching documents individually; no use is made of relationships among documents. The relationships of documents are sometimes reflected in the display. Even in such cases, because of its linearity, the display simplifies all relationships to a one-dimensional, linear order, either chronologically, alphabetically, or some kind of relevant <ref type="bibr">(weighted)</ref> order between documents and the query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">A framework of information retrieval</head><p>To get around the framework of "exact match" and "linear display", we have the second framework. In this framework, the "exact match" is expanded to "fuzzy match"', and the "linear display" is replaced by "graphical</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I Fuzzy Match I</head><p>Flg.1 Two frameworks for information retrieval. The left hand side Is the traditional "exact matchlinear display" framework. The right hand side is the "fuzzy matchgraphical display" framework. See text for discussions of the frameworks.</p><p>' "Fuzzy" should really be read as "not exact''. 8s we use "fuzzy match" to refer all those that do notfall in the "exact match" category.</p><p>display". "Fuzzy match" loosely covers retrieval methods using advanced statistics and probability theory, fuzzy logic, computational linguistics and various aspects of artificial intelligence.</p><p>In these methods, measures ofdocument closeness are adopted and association of documents is considered at the time of matching and retrieving. To make these more effective, the framework emphasizes that the relationships of documents should also be considered during display. The display should be more than one dimensional in order to capture the complexity of document relationships. It should take advantage of graphical features to make information in the document set visible to the user; it should be constructed so that the capability of human perception can be utilized; and it should be able to intrigue the user to discover or recognize patterns that emerge from underlying data.</p><p>The frameworks simplify information retrieval into two steps: retrieval and display. For many years, research on information retrieval in fact was centered around these two steps. Traditional research focused more on retrieval than on display <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Current research has been making a great progress in terms of expanding "exact match" to "fuzzy match" <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. It is unfortunate that results of "fuzzy match" are still most often displayed in linear forms. One may argue that the linear form could eventually be improved, such as displaying documents in orders relevant to the query.</p><p>We strongly believe that, rather than improving the linear display, a two-dimensional display should couple better with the "fuzzy match". With appropriate construction, the two-dimensional graphical display will allow the screen to accommodate more documents, show relationships of documents, and reveal underlying structures and patterns. Combining these with human perception capabilities, the user will likely find it easier to do the most intelligent and subjective job in retrieval: making relevant judgments and selecting documents that satisfy his information needs.</p><p>Introducing two-dimensional graphical displays for information retrieval may provoke new thought on the matter of information retrieval. While the linear display seems to be a natural counterpart of the "exact match", we will show that the two-dimensional graphical display will serve better for results of "fuzzy match". As the "exact match" is expanded to "fuzzy match", the display is at least as important as retrieval. It is important to realize that query matching is inherently inaccurate <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. While it is generally desirable to have high precision and high recall retrieval mechanisms, it is perhaps more practical to provide browsing aids so that the user can easily identify relevant information in a low precisionhigh recall situation. Graphical displays that let the user visualize document relationships and browse large amount of search results will likely relax the demands on matching mechanisms. Thus, our research is to construct and study graphical displays that can be integrated into various information retrieval systems to improve the functionality of the systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Kohonen's feature map algorithm</head><p>Kohonen's feature map algorithm is based on the understanding that "the representation of knowledge in a particular category of things in general might assume the form of a feature map that is geometrically organized over the corresponding piece of the brain" <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The algorithm takes a set of N-dimensional objects as input and maps them onto nodes of a two-dimensional grid, resulting an orderly feature map. Two main properties of such a feature map are: the feature map preserves the distance relationships between the input data as faithfully as possible. While some distortion is unavoidable, the mapping preserves the most important neighboring relationships between the input data, and makes such relationships geographically explicit. the feature map allocates different numbers of nodes to inputs based on their occurrence frequencies. The more frequent input patterns are mapped to larger domains at the expense of the less frequent ones 161.</p><p>Kohonen's feature map has been applied to many practical problems in various areas such as statistical pattern recognition, speech recognition, robot arms control, industrial process control, image compression, optimization problems and analysis of semantic information <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Early examples and applications of feature maps mostly demonstrated that the feature map could preserve metric relationships and the topology of input patterns. The application of the feature map to cognitive information processing particularly offers the possibility "to create in an unsupervised process topographical representations of semantic, nonmetric relationships implicit in linguistic data" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[ 6 ]</ref> , p. 243). In the following two sections, we present two simulation results of using Kohonen's feature map to generate map displays for the document space. The first is an example of how a set of documents retrieved by a query can be mapped to reveal major concepts and clusters of the document set. The second demonstrates how a personal collection can be mapped into a personal knowledge space to allow easy inspection of one's own personal collection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">A Map Display for documents on multilingual information retrieval</head><p>After conducting an extensive search on multilingual information revieval on INSPEC database in DIALOG, we obtained a set consisting of 3 1 1 documents. From this set, we produced an inverted index of the 31 1 titles. After excluding some stop words, the most frequently occurring words and the least frequently occurring words (those appearing no more than 4 times), 40 words were retained.</p><p>These words were used as the set of indexing words for this collection. These 40 words and 311 titles form a 40*311 matrix of documents vs. indexing words, where each row is a document vector and each column corresponds to a word. A document vector contains a "1" in a given column if the corresponding word occurs in the document title and a "0" otherwise. The document vectors are used as input to train a feature map of 40 features and 140 nodes (140 nodes are chosen because the 10 by 14 rectangle seems to fit the screen best). Following the Kohonen's algorithm:</p><p>each feature corresponds to a selected word, each document is an input vector;</p><p>each node on the map is associated with a vector of weights which are assigned small random values at beginning of the training; during the training process, a document is randomly selected, the node closest to it in N-dimensional vector distance is chosen; and the weight of the node and weights of its neighboring nodes are adjusted accordingly;</p><p>The training process proceeds iteratively for a certain number of training cycles. It stops when the map converges.</p><p>document is mapped to a grid node.</p><p>When the training process is completed, each <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref> is the semantic map of the documents obtained after 2500 training iterations. The map contains very rich information:</p><p>The areas on the map can be seen as concept areas (more precisely, word areas). These areas, determined by mapping of unit vectors after the training is completed, visualize the general content of this collection. As we can see, multilingual information retrieval is represented by the map in roughly three parts, the languages such Chinese, Japanese, Arab and EUROTRA (the left part), the technologies such as software, interface, networks, speech (understanding), and expert (systems), (the middle part), and the tools such as (multilingual) dictionaries, thesaurus, bibliographies and libraries (the right part). The size of the areas corresponds to the frequencies of occurrence of the words appeared in the titles. Thus, that the area "Chinese" is larger than the area "Japanese" indicates that there are more documents on</p><p>Chinese retrieval than documents on Japanese retrieval in this collection. Similarly, there are likely more discussions on distributed networks than on interface.</p><p>frequencies of the co-occurrmce of words represented by the areas. Areas of "character coding" is next to areas of "Japanese" and "Chinese" because they often cooccur in the documents. Thus, we may get the impression that a major issue for Asian languages retrieval is character coding. On the other hand, "EUROTRA" is next to "grammar", "distributed networks" and "training", so we know that EUROTRA (a major project on cross-retrieval on European languages) deals with more on grammars and distributed networks than on character coding. Without reading any documents, we have already seen a difference between Asian languages retrieval and European languages retrieval.</p><p>The neighboring relationships of areas indicate</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.A map display for a personal collection</head><p>The second simulation was to apply Kohonen's feature map to a personal collection. A researcher's personal collection was collected in a Hypercard stack. The collection contained 660 documents, which were accumulated over many years as a by-product of the person's research activities. Each document in this collection contains a citation (author, title, source, etc.), an abstract and sometimes the first page of the article. We first did a preprocess that included the following four steps: 1) identification of unique words in the collection after necessary truncations, 2) exclusion of the stop words, 3) frequency counts of all the words identified, and 4) exclusion of the most and the least frequently occurring words. The preprocessing resulted in 1472 unique words which was then used to index the collection, creating 660 vectors of 1472 dimensions. After a normalization process, these vectors were used as input to train a 10 by 14 Kohonen's feature map. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> shows the result after 2500 learning iterations. The whole learning process took about 202 seconds in a Cray super-computer.</p><p>As we see, the mapping of such a personal collection creates a personal knowledge space. The space shows the mearcher's major research areas and the relationships of these areas. The size of areas, corresponding to the frequencies of the words, indicates relative importance of the areas to the researcher (the more often a word appears in the personal collection, the more likely the word will correspond to a large area in the space). The neighboring relationships, corresponding to the frequencies of cooccurring words, reflect associations of the areas resulting from the activities of the researcher. Some of these associations, such as the association of "query" with "retrieval", are clear to anyone in the field of research, other associations may need the interpretation of the researher. For example, without knowing that the researcher was interested in animation for story-telling to students, we would not understand why "story" and "student" were represented as two major areas nearby the area marked "animation".</p><p>The space is organized in a hierarchical form. The colors (or the gray scales) indicate the four top levels of the hierarchy. Within each level there are subject areas organized by their inter-relationships. For example, within the first hierarchical level on the left, "traditional AI" and "neural networks" are located on different side of the area "AI". This indicates two different but associated approaches to artificial intelligence; while "parallel" is close to "neural networks", "expert (systems)" is close to "Knowledge (base)", and so on. When we looked further into the "neural networks" area (by analysis of mapping results not shown on the map), we could see that words mapped to this area were: connectionist, model, learning, process, unsupervised, net, error, and principle component analysis. (Evidently, the researcher is interested in comparing neural networks to principle component analysis.) Similarly, words mapped onto "hypertext" area included link, text, color, structure, browsing, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (whcre the first hypertext conference was held).</p><p>Each document in the collection also has a unique position in the personal knowledge space. The document positions show the distribution of the personal collection over the personal knowledge space. This distribution may remind the researcher which areas he has more documents and in which areas he may need to have more documents. The distribution can also be used to show migration of the rcseucher's interest over time. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> gives the distributions of the first 100 documents and the last 100 documents in the collection. Since the documents are collected sequentially over time, we can see a clear migration of the researcher's interest from early more broad distribution over several areas, such as CD-ROMs, programming languages, and interfaces, to a more current concentration on neural networks, matrix (operations) and retrieval. The interpretation, of course, will make more sense to the researcher than to others. When the map was presented to the researcher, he confirmed that those areas and relationships shown on the map were "basically correct". He found that what we interpreted by the map sometimes even revealed interesting relationships he did not think about before. He thought that the map could be seen as a picture or a summary of his past six years research activities. There are many other potentials for the personal knowledge space. One of the most important ones will be to incorporate such a space in a personal information system. A personal information system in the future will no longer limit to physical collection in his office or his ... . home. It will include those documents in many online fulltext databases that are reachable any time and that are constantly being added with more documents. Thus, a more important component of future personal information systems is a personal indexing and personal monitor. The indexing maintains an indexing to documents, both inhouse and online, that he is interested in. A map of his personal interest will be drawn and undated as the indexing is updated. Based on the map, or the personal knowledge space, the monitor will routinely keep track of new documents in the online databases. Any documents that fall into the personal space will be shown on the space.</p><p>All the indexing, updating, and monitoring may take place during the night. Thus, every morning, when a researcher come to his office, he will notice new documents by scanning through the map. Then he can decide if the new documents should be kept with his personal indexing or discarded. When documents are kept with the indexing, they will eventually change the map later through updating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussions</head><p>Visualization for the document space is an important issue for future information retrieval systems. There are two fundamental questions related to this issue. The first is what kind of graphical displays that will better visualize the document space, and the second is which underlying engine will derive the graphical display that we select.</p><p>We would like to have the graphical display that will convey a great deal of information to the user so that effective use of the human visual capabilities can be made. The graphical display should help to reveal useful structure of the document space to assist the user in searching and browsing this space. It should eventually help the user to acquire new knowledge and understanding about the document space.</p><p>In the literature, there have been several types of graphical displays for information retrieval, mainly icon displays imposes a rigid structure to obtain clusters and hierarchies from the underlying data. The network display explicitly makes links among items in order to support associations and visual inference. The scatter display emphasizes overall layout of a document space in an attempt to reveal the underlying structure as faithfully as possible. While the icon display is more individualized, the hierarchical display and the network display are more structuralized, and the scatter display is more spatialized <ref type="figure">(See [16]</ref>) for more discussion on these different forms of graphical displays).</p><p>In this paper, we proposed a map display that shows overall layout of a document space in a structuralized form. We argued that the map display may provide the right granularity and richer visual information, compared to other forms of graphical displays. The map display has a minimum-error mapping feature as does the scatter display. It shows implicit links through its neighboring relationships in order to avoid overly complex link structures as often found in many network displays. The map display lets the underlying structure "emerge" from the input data, rather than be "imposed" by programs or other artificial means, so it does not limit itself to a structure as rigid as the hierarchy, and clusters and groups can still come out naturally from the mapping. Spatial arrangement of visual cues on the map display also improves the association between documents and their major concepts.</p><p>The map display has many other potentials as well. It allows some naturally occurring ambiguities and lets each individual viewer impose his interpretations of the display, depending on his interests at the time of observation.</p><p>With good implementation, the map display will be able to present multiple views of the same underlying structure, and let the user zoom in to display the views at a level of different details <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>. Furthermore, the map display can be generated automatically by its underlying engine, Kohonen's self-organizing feature map. As a dimensional reduction technique, the feature map has the properties of economic representation of underlying data and their interrelationships. As a visualization tool, the feature map produces rich geographic features for visual inferences.</p><p>Other engines that have been used to generate graphical displays often include hierarchical clusters, multidimensional scaling, principal component analysis, and various mathematical models such as graph theories, Lattices, PFnets, etc. It would be interesting to compare Kohonen's feature map with those of others within the context of generating graphical displays for information retrieval. When we used a data set, containing 900 patterns of 150 dimensions, to test several of these engines, we found that the hierarchical cluster program took more than 20 times longer than the Kohonen's feature map to produce a result. The principal component analysis just took about twice as much time as the feature map, and the multidimensional scaling was completely out of the race. While these comparisons need to be read with caution as they may be bias because of our particular implementations of these engines, our experience seems to suggest that Kohonen's feature map would be more feasible to implement on information systems than the other engines that we mentioned.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>The map display for a document collection on multilingual information retrieval.
