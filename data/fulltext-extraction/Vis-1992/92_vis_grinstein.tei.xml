<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Shear flows such as present in mixing layers, jets and wakes, occur when a fluid stream moves past another with a different velocity, or when it moves past a rigid surface. The role of shear flows is crucial in many practical applications for both external flows and internal flows. Experimental investigations in idealized geometries have shown that organized, largescale vortical structuresknown as coherent structures (CS)</p><p>dominate the entrainment and mixing processes [l] .</p><p>The study of the physical properties of the CS requires accurate flow data to identify and characterize their main features in order to develop both a conceptual model and an analytic framework for their description. Computer simulations and laboratory experiments offer two complementary approaches in this research.</p><p>Flow visualization plays a fundamental role in the investigation of the dynamics and topology of the three dimensional CS controlling the development of reactive shear flows. From the data generated in numerical simulations, computer graphics is used to d i s play the flow features in terms of appropriately chc+ sen representations of scalar and vector characteristic flow quantities. Instantaneous visualizations provide basic information on the topological features of the flow, while animation of these visualizations gives an insight into the detailed dynamics of formation, development and interaction of CS and how they affect the entrainment and mixing processes.</p><p>In the present work we address relevant issues and difficulties involved in the practical implementation of flow visualization techniques based on the database of simulations, and show how visualization can be used to investigate the structure and dynamics of unsteady, initially laminar jets. Simulations of free jets at NRL have included, 1) spatially-evolving simulations of twcdimensional axisymmetric jets [2] focusing on the dynamics of transitional laminar jets based on vortex-ring models, 2) temporal 3D round-jet simulations using the NRL Connection Machine [3], where the focus has been on the effects of helical excitation on the flow development, and 3) spatially-evolving 3D simulations of square jets [4]. Objectives of the square jet simulations are to a) examine the role of vortex reconnection processes in the breakdown of vortex-rings; b) investigate the role of axis-switching on entrainment, mixing and combustion; c) investigate how the jet development is affected by the energy release due to chemical reactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Square Jets</head><p>In recent years, there have been many efforts d e voted to investigating the properties of non-circular jets [5][6][7]. Because these jets have enhanced characteristic entrainment properties relative to those of circular jets with comparable dimensions, the use of non-circular nozzles is of considerable interest for the passivecontrol of jet combustion and jet noise. Noncircular nozzles having corners, in particular, are capable of enhancing entrainment through less coherent large-scale CS, while also enhancing small-scale mixing near the corners. Rectangular jets are of great importance in the aerospace community due to the use of vectored thrust on aircraft, and the increased mixing of the jet plume with the surroundings which decreases jet detection.</p><p>Studies of laboratory reactive square jets have been reported [7] using planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) techniques, to visualize the combustion regions at cross-stream planes at fixed streamwise locations. The experiments show enhanced mixing in the neighborhood of the corner regions, near the jet outlet, and then as the visualization progresses downstream, first a thicker, more rounded combustion region, and then a much thicker, square-shaped region with characteristic axis rotated 45" relative to the nozzle, suggesting the occurrence of the (so-called) axisswitching of "square" vortex rings. Depending on the initial conditions (e.g., the turbulence level and the ratio jetdiameter /shear-layer-thickness ) this axis-switching in square jets, is found to either occur only once or to not occur at all. Numerical simulations have been used to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms leading to these experimental observations of square jets, and to examine the development of the jet further on downstream, including the occurrence of pairing of vortex rings [4].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Numerical Model</head><p>The numerical simulation of transitional free jets is limited in practice by serious challenges, namely dealing with: 1) the threedimensionality of the large-scale structures, 2) the inherently spatially evolving nature of the flows, 3) and the very demanding resolution requirements near the end of the potential core where vortex-ring breakdown takes place.</p><p>The numerical model used in the present work solves the 3D, timedependent, compressible conservation equations for mass, momentum and energy for ideal gases. computational cells. The grid spacing is chosen to pr+ vide a resolution adequate enough to ensure an initial linear growth of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in agreement with theory for the natural mode of the shear layer and its subharmonics.</p><p>Integrations are performed using a 2D FCT module for the cross-stream directions and a 1D FCT module for the streamwise direction, which are then cou- </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results and Discussion</head><p>An inviscid, non-reactive, initially laminar jetregime was investigated, to simulate the large scale features of the transitional flow dynamics. In this flow regime, the FCT high-frequency filtering combined with the conservative, causal and monotonic properties of the algorithm, effectively provide a minimal subgrid model for turbulence, maintaining the large scale structures without aliasing while numerically smoothing the scales with wavelengths smaller than a few computational cells <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>.</p><p>The basic flow configuration studied involves a cold jet of air at uniform standard temperature and pres sure emerging from a square nozzle into quiescent background air with a square tophat velocity profile The simulation examines the flow downstream of the nozzle, detailed boundary-layer effects are neglected and are only effectively included in the very thin initial shear layers. The main objective of this work is to examine the effects of the azimuthal curvature changes due to the nozzle corners, on the (essential1y.inviscid) vortex dynamics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Visualization</head><p>The largescale features of the development of CS in the jet are investigated by examining the properties of the timedependent organization of the vorticity field, in terms of surface and volume renderings of the vorticity magnitude, and vortex lines.</p><p>A typical instantaneous visualization of the developed jet is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 1</ref>, where the jet emerges from a square nozzle at the bottom of the figure and evolves towards the top, in terms of a volume visualization of vorticity magnitude using a ray-tracing technique. <ref type="figure">Figures 2a and 2b</ref> are visualizations based on the same data, but in terms of isasurfaces of vorticity magnitude corresponding to n/npe&amp; = 0.25, and Q/npeak = 0.10, respectively. These visualizations were generated using the Application Visualization System (AVS) software from Advanced Visual S y s tems, Inc. The figure depicts the outstanding topological features of the flow, including the square vortexsheet near the inflow (at the bottom) rolled-up into a vortex-ring structure, the presence of longitudinal (streamwise) structures, and further on downstream, a (more disorganized) region of the flow depicting the late stage of a pairing process. Comparison of Figs. 1 and 2 shows that a volume visualization technique used in conjuction with an adequate choice of color transparencies ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 1</ref>) can give a richer, more informative picture of the flow, than that obtained with (the more frequently used) isosurfaces <ref type="figure">(Figs. 2)</ref>. ISG surfaces are associated to specified values of the phys ical quantity considered and, as shown in Figs. 2, can be quite sensitive to changes on the (inherently subjective) choice of the "significant" values used for their specification.</p><p>The development in space and time of a single vortex-ring structure is viewed from two different perspectives in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> in terms of vortex lines, which trace the direction of the vorticity field. The loops in the figure were generated at consecutive times by vortex lines through the core of a vortex ring as it is convected downstream. The NASA/NAS FAST software was used to generate these flow visualizations. The figure shows the evolution of a vortex loop in the initial square vortex sheet as it deforms under the effects of self-induced velocity <ref type="bibr">[ll]</ref> in the neighborhood of the corners, showing that the latter portions of the vortex loop first move ahead, and thendue to the self-induced velocity in the new configuration, move towards the jet axis <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3a)</ref>.</p><p>Streamwise vorticity of both signs introduced in the neighborhood of the corners a s a consequence of the self-induced distortion of the loops, is crucial in deter-mining the larger entrainment and mixing properties of the square jet relative to its circular counterpart. Observing an evolving vortex-ring from a point in the jebaxis at the inflow boundary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 3b</ref>), first shows a rounder loop and then the occurrence of 45"-axis switching of the ring, with respect to the initial section, suggested by the experimental visualizations <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. However, it is clear from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figs. 1-3</ref> that much more than just axis-switching is involved in this process, since the rings become quite distorted from their original square shape and are far from being planar. More over, as in the experiments, further axisswitching of the vortex-rings due to these mechanisms was not observed. This is probably so, because new vortex-ring deformations are effectively lesssignificant due to the much larger cross-section of the vortex-rings, and thus smaller self-induced velocities in the large curvature regions.</p><p>The initial evolution of a square vortex ring in the jet can be essentially understood in terms of the selfinduced deformations of an isolated ring. However, the later development of these rings is determined by the strong and complicated interaction between themselves and the longitudinal vortices resulting from the stretching of the streamwise vorticity generated at the corners of the nozzle. The animation of visualizations showing this dynamics in detail in terms of volume imaging of vorticity magnitude has been recorded in a NTSC video. Technical issues that we have found relevant to the actual preparation of the animations are discussed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Animation</head><p>In dealing with the animation of the visualizations simulating the spatial and temporal development of the jet flow, one has to address a number of practical issues. The animation involves generating a series of frames at suitable regularly spaced times, and organizing them in a video segment, with a convenient rep&amp; tition frequency in order to achieve a desired playback speed. A major difficulty encountered in this process is the relatively large amount of data which needs to be handled. For example, if the grid size of the jet is 120x60~60 grid points and each grid point holds one floating-point data item, the size of a dataset is about 1.7 Mega bytes. This is typically true if one uses a single variable such as vorticity magnitude at each grid point, but the requirements are much more demanding when other variables associated with the 3D flow have to be stored in order to allow for additional studies.</p><p>In order for the animation segment to be long enough to allow a detailed analysis, large amounts of data need to be readily available on disk, unless the visualization is performed simultaneously with the simulation. Although the latter approach is very promis ing, it is not very practical at present because it is currently limited by factors such as slow-rates in network data-transfer, lack of built-in software capability for parallel execution, and difficulties in controlling the visualization process interactively (in order to choose suitable visualization parameters). An additional important factor to consider is that relating to the portability of the data through different hardware architectures, since the simulations are performed in a supercomputer and the visualization is performed on a works tation.</p><p>Choosing an appropriate visualization package is also a challenging task in creating the animation. Important features we have considered in producing the animation are 1) built-in animation capabilities, 2) ability to handle large amounts of time-dependent data, 3) direct interface to the recording devices, and 4) expandability of visualization techniques.</p><p>Initially, Wavefront Technologies' Data Visualizer was used on a SGI's IRIS 4D/25GT to produce the animation. Since there was no convenient way available to control the recording process directly from the visualization software, individually rendered frames were saved to disk and subsequently recorded at a suitable speed. Performing interpolation between frames is possible with this software package. The built-in capability would take datasets that are subsampled in time and generate intermediate datasets by linear inteqm lation. Although as shown below, this method may generate excessively diffused intermediate data, one can use it as a compromise solution when insufficient disk space and/or difficulties handling large amounts of data dictate the constraints on what can be practically done. Due to insufficient central memory and CPU graphics power on the SGI workstation where the Data Visualizer was installed, a considerable amount of time was actually involved in producing animations with this software package.</p><p>As an alternative, we had the AVS software installed on the more powerful, Stardent's Vistra 8000EX workstation. An attractive feature of the AVS software is its capability of using "user written modules" to expand the available visualization techniques . This capability was used, in particular, to write a module that performed interpolation between datasets. We took advantage of using a portable data format in the module, and using binary instead of ASCII data determined considerable savings of disk space. NCSA's HDF format turned out to be the best possible choice since it was available on both the supercomputer and the workstations. In practice, this module would read a series of HDF datasets, use a toggle button to control the interpolation with a specified number of intermediate steps, and yield one output dataset at a time to be used by other modules such as "isosurface" or "orthogonal slice" . Another advantage of using AVS was that the recording was much easier using a built-in VCR control module that had the capability of recording during the animation, in contrast with the need to save on disk the individualy rendered frames with Data visualizer.</p><p>As pointed out above, interpolating data to create intermediate temporal frames between frames corresponding to different physical times for which actual data is available, can result in a considerable reduction in the number of datasets required to create an animation. However, the tri-linear interpolation used can give rise to spurious and unphysical effects during the animation. A feature which moves with the flow appears to fade out at its old location and simultane ously begins to appear at its new location at the next timestep. This results in an unphysical pulsating effect in the animation, an effect which is reduced if the two datasets used for the interpolation are chosen to be more closely spaced in time.</p><p>In order to examine this effect further, we can look at the effects of interpolation by focusing our attention on a two-dimensional slice through the jet axis. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows color contours of the vorticity magnitude on such a slice. <ref type="figure">Figure 4a</ref> and 4d correspond to the two datasets used for interpolation. <ref type="figure">Figure 4b</ref> is made from actual data at a time halfway between those of Figs. 4a and 4d. <ref type="figure">Figure 4b</ref> should be compared to <ref type="figure">Fig. 4c</ref>, which is obtained by interpolation between <ref type="figure">Figs. 4a and 4d</ref>. In addition to errors in the value of the data, the shape of the structures is clearly distorted. This unphysical result can be highly mi* leading and can lead to erroneous conclusions being drawn. The magnitude of the error in the interpolation was as high as 100% in certain locations.</p><p>The unphysical results from tri-linear interpolation arise from the fact that the structures in the jet flow evolve both in time and space. Interpolation would be adequate for structures that do not move spatially: it is this motion that is not properly represented. An improved interpolation scheme which would also take the motion of the flow into account is required. However, it appears that this would require a much larger amount of data than is currently being handled. The difficulties faced by the interpolation method can be alleviated by using more datasets, more closely spaced together in time. If enough datasets are available, the resulting animation will be smooth enough even without additional frames being inserted by interpolation. However, the amount of data which must be trans ferred from the supercomputer, stored on the workstation, and then displayed by the visualization software can become impossible to handle.</p><p>A close examination of the data associated with two consecutive datasets reveals that there is very little change between the two. We have taken advantage of this fact to develop a simple, but highly effective compression scheme. Compression from 50 to 300 times has been observed, depending on the data and on how different subsequent datasets are. First, the floating point data is discretized into 8-bit data. The differences between two subsequent sets of discretized data is calculated. Most of the differences are zero, and long runs of a constant difference are present. These non-zero differences are compressed by a simple runlength-encoding scheme and written to a file. This process takes place on-the-fly while the fluid dynamic simulations are taking place. This much smaller file is then transferred to the workstation. The original data can be reconstructed if necessary, but this is avoided if the visualization software can directly uncompress the data. We have written a suitable AVS module which reconstructs the data one dataset at a time. Thus, only the memory for one dataset at a time is required. At the present time, we have successfully made smooth animations from two-dimensional calculations, and we are currently implementing this procedure for threedimensional data.</p></div>
