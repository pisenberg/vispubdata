<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction and Overview of the</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Domain</head><p>Fluid dynamics is the quintessential nonlinear space-time domain of great fundamental and practical interest which describes the mathematics of fluid flow (liquids and gases). It is the essence of such diverse fields as aeronautics, meteorology, oceanography, and combustion, and thereby encompasses a large range of experimental platforms. These include, laboratories (e.g. wind tunnels), observations (satellite imagery), and computations (supercomputer simulations).</p><p>One is most familiar with pictures and visualizations of flow about aircraft and missiles. The work of the various NASA laboratories (particularly NASA Ames [6, 71) in representing fluid environments about aircraft is well known to students and researchers. Also, visualizations of the fluid environments of planets associated with climate and weather (ocean and atmospheric flows) have been made widely available to workers by NCAR.</p><p>Our work focuses on harnessing these algorithms, where possible, and concentrating on the quantification and juxtaposition of intrinsic processes associated with the evolution of scalar, vector and tensor fields in two and three dimensions, in particular the underlying interactions which occur in vortex dominated flows and turbulence. embedded in a nearly passive -incoherent background (or sea) of intermixed and distributed vorticity. Only a deep understanding of coherent and uncorrelated (or weakly correlated) processes and phenomena associated with vortex dominated flows will allow an appreciation for observed atmospheric and oceanographic phenomena and technological problems associated with aircraft wake control, chemical species mixing, atmospheric/oceanographic species dispersal, (hurricanes, tornadoes, polar vortex and ozone holes), combustion, process control, etc.</p><p>The applications of vortex dynamics studies are to 2D multilayer and 3D flows in the presence of fixed and moving solid and porous boundaries, free surfaces, stratification and rotation. In 2D and multilayer-2D, high resolutions have been obtained with pseudospectral, piecewise-parabolic method (ppm), and particularly the lagrangian contour dynamical/surgery codes. In laboratory experiments, laser sheets, particle image velocimetry and multi-element probes have enhanced our quantitative understanding of processes and phenomena.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Coherent Vortex Structure Processes</head><p>In the last decade, we have begun to appreciate the processes associated with coherent manifestations of vorticity. For example, in 2D and multilayer 2D, we now appreciate the role of merger (or pairing) of like signed vorticity, binding or entrainment of opposite signed vorticity and axisymmetrization and stripping of isolated regions in strain fields. In 3D, the diverse space-time configurations associated with breakdown of isolated tubes through the occurrence of stagna---</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Vortex Dynamics</head><p>The generation, interaction and dispersal or mixing of vorticity plays a profound role in a wide class of practical and fundamental fluid flows. By "vortex dynamics" we mean the motion of fluids at high Reynolds number that are dominated by localized concentrations of vorticity (or coherent vortex structures) tion points and reconnection of tube-like regions has been viewed as a scattering process. It would be valuable to associate these physical-space processes with the wave-number cascade processes and non-gaussian turbulent statistics.</p><p>The ideas of low degree-of-freedom chaotic nonlinear systems has enriched the understanding of mixing and predictability phenomena. In the future these processes should be quantified and linked through a hierarchy of asymptotically verifiable mathematical models (see Section 3). This will help us interpret experiments and large scale simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Results</head><p>As with any field which produces massive amounts of data, visualization plays an important role for the analysis and interpretation of these results. (The data sets that we generate are typically regular, e.g. 96+ cubed, vector and scalar time series.) However, to gain an understanding, one must be able to quantify and mathematize the interaction among localized vortex entities. This goal is similar to many other scientific disciplines i.e. to study the evolution and essential dynamics and interactions of noted effects (connected regions of high/low intensity) and describe them for a modified time period, thus obtaining a partial solution to the original problem. In this step, quantitative measurements, based upon mathematical-physical-visual properties, are used to reduce the amount of data and highlight the areas of interest. Researchers have found that a coherent structure (or object) approach to nonlinear dynamical systems is often more rewarding than a statistical approach, as it focuses on the nature of the space-time interactions of the structure which can be associated with intensification and "intermittency".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Early Model</head><p>The computational discovery of the soliton by Zabusky and Kruskal in 1965 and the subsequent discovery of the mathematically exact linearization techniques provide an early paradigm of the entire range of the model-building process in which visualization played an important part <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. In the early sixties, computer simulations were made of the KdV equation (a then intractable nonlinear partial differential equation) and the results visualized (the first movie of such a solution). This showed the appearance of new coherent and persistent structures which were called "solitons", because they were related to the solitary wave solutions of this equation, known since 1895. The existence of a small set of exact mathematical invariants provided a handle on this problem and a transformation was found to linearize this equation exactly (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> for a complete discussion).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Recent W o r k</head><p>In our laboratory, we have been studying both 2D and 3D problems in vortex dynamics with a concentration on quantifying the evolution of observed coherent regions. In 2D, we present results form the 2D shock-interface problem, in which a shock wave (M=2) hits an interface between fluids of different density (p2/p1 = 3.0) and is accompanied by cascade to small-scale vortex structure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1)</ref>. In 3D, we show numerical simulations of evolving vortex tubes initially offset and perpendicular (see above section) and compare results from different experimental platforms. When the tubes are of equal magnitude, they are observed to "collapse" toward each other as they rotate in space and become locally antiparallel. "Bridges" grow and the tubes reconnect, creating two horizontal tubes and the vertical remnants quickly disappear. This is known as reconnection <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref> represent isosurfaces of 30% of magnitude, the data is 96 cubed). When the tube are not of equal strengths, the weaker tube is wound about the stronger one [2]. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Visiometrics and Model Building</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">quantification: measurements to determine how</head><p>the regions have changed, where they have moved, and how they interact with other regions (this also includes identifying the interactions, i.e. mergers, windings, bursting, bifurcations, etc.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">unders t andmg /mat hemat izat ion:</head><p>based upon the metrics from above, the scientist attempts to formulate low degree-of-freedom mathematical models describe the interactions of observed phenomena (this may involve juztaposition: comparisons with other simulations/ experiments).</p><p>We call this process, visiometrics [l], i.e. the visualization and quantification of evolving amorphous phenomena. One of our aims is to develop sophisticated algorithms to aid in the automatic identification and tracking of these multidimensional observed phenomena. Many of the ideas are analogous to 2D computer vision which strives to automatically analyze, recognize, and track objects in motion [3].</p><p>To isolate objects in a scalar field, thresholding can be performed in conjunction with connectivity information (in addition rules on splitting/merging must be incorporated, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">41)</ref>. However, because evolving objects undergo large deformations during the simulations, classifying them can be difficult (a table of interacting structures is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>). However, steps can be taken to ease this task by abstracting: using a low degree-of-freedom quantification of geometric and topological features of space filling objects. These shapes are elementary and generic to various disciplines, examples include: line-like structures found in images of 2D projections of jet streams, storm fronts, and galaxy formations; tube-like (in 3D) such as a tornado or a typhoon, contrails of fiying aircraft; sheet-like and ellipsoid-like structures such as distorted bubbles or regions near extrema of any function. These abstractions can also help in simplifying procedures for tracking objects <ref type="figure">(in [ll]</ref>, line-like regions were used to abstract vortex tubes and track their movements) and in quantifying regions (see be-</p><p>In the following section we present two examples of quantification techniques which have aided in understanding our simulations. low).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Examples</head><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>, we show an example of ellipse fitting to the 2D shock bubble interaction. The instability of the shear layer causes the objects (initially there are only three) to break-up (disassemble). However, the merger process associated with the inverse cascade phenomenon of 2D turbulence is manifest and the number of objects decrease. The variation of the number of objects and their content provides an alternate physical-space topological manifestation of instability [SI. The use of ellipses is important because elliptical boundaries are exact solutions for a class of 2D incompressible flows. We have applied this technique to our 3D data sets as well [13].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Data Juxtaposition</head><p>Model building can also be aided by data juztaposition, the comparison of different data sets and the resulting features. This procedure will quickly reveal consistencies and differences in fluid models between numerical models and in comparison to laboratory environments because the same phenomena is represented with other parameter ranges. An excellent candidate that will test concepts, methods and algorithms is the scattering paradigm for vortex reconnection in three dimensions. Since this is a localized and intense space-time event, details of boundary condition and environmental parameters will play a minor and controllable role in the outcome.</p><p>We have begun this process by comparing a lowdegree of freedom mathematical model to the more complex (continuum) simulation in this problem. The Biot-Savart integral represents the velocity field of the Euler equations by an integral of a Greens function over the vorticity distribution with the assumption that the vorticity is confined to an unchanging small-cross section (filament, curve). This greatly reduces the computational burden. Recent results have shown a remarkable consistency in qualitative topological features between the two simulations. For example, the pre-reconnection configuration of vorticity and rate-of-strain matrix show similar featuresi.e. the everpresent anti-parallel collapse and large intensification of off-vortex axis strain rates is common to both models (see torus like pattern in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). (The qualitative details are different and will require an enhanced reduced model.) Because the Biot-Savart code runs more quickly it can readily provide insightful guidance for the choice of parameters in the continuum evolutions. Furthermore, skeletal representations for tube-like regions should allow a ready quantification/compaction mode. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> also represents a juxtaposition of two related vector fields: vorticity and the stretching term. (This data set is of frame three of <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.) The regions of high magnitude are represented using ellipsoids (light for vorticity, dark for normalized stretching term) and the field lines are displayed emanating from these regions (black is vorticity). Here the coherent field pattern is a 'torus'-like object whose upper and lower transversals are in the place of the bridges of vorticity which will soon emerge. Note that the longer sides of the torus are on the outside of the light ellipsoids, indicating that there will be a "stretching" (reduction) of vorticity in these locations. The torus pattern is a signature of reconnection and was found using our quantification tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>.</p><p>In the last example, we show an instance of isolating objects for quantification (or abstraction). This figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 6</ref>) is the last frame of the winding runin which the two tubes are of unequal magnitude and the weaker is wrapped around the stronger one. Although the tubes appear distinct, the isosurfaces are connected at this threshold value. It is sometimes advantageous to disconnect these large regions as was done in this instance (using maxima information and previous history [9]).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Future</head><p>We have presented a brief example of the visualization and quantification of a complex fluid interaction to give one a feeling for the difficulty of dealing with geometrical and topological questions in three dimensions and time. To obtain a quantitative understanding we have employed visiometric techniques including: thresholding, object isolation, ellipsoid fitting, abstraction, vector field line generation, and data juxtaposition. There is still much work to be done in developing algorithms and tools to automatically extract and quantify these (and other) features. Some examples include:</p><p>1. automatically isolating distinct features (see also ~91) , 2. parameterizing objects for classification, 3. detecting interactions and topological changes, and 4. quantifying the "background" area.</p><p>These techniques will become especially important in the processing and analysis of massive data series being produced by sophisticated new parallel supercomputers and observation equipment.     </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>involves the following steps [lo, 91: Our approach to visualization and quantification 1. identification: visualizationrendering an image, feature extractionisolating coherent noted regions and feature classificationidentifying this region as either a known or a possibly new phenomena (ezamples include: eddies, blast waves, rings, tubes, spikes, etc..</figDesc></figure>
