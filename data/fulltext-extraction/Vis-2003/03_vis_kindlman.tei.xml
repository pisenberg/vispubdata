<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Direct volume rendering depicts structure in scalar fields through a simple combination of mappings. At each rendered sample point, locally measured numerical quantities (mainly the data value itself) are mapped via the transfer function to optical quantities such as opacity and color. Basic computer graphics routines can then shade, composite, and project the samples into a coherent visualization.</p><p>In nearly all applications, some part of this process involves the first-order differential structure of the field: the gradient. Shading routines generally require the gradient direction as input to a surface-based lighting model. There is also a trend towards using gradient magnitude in the transfer function domain, enabling visualization of material boundaries based on data value and edge strength <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[Levoy 1988</ref>]. In either case, first-order differential field structure enhances the clarity and effectiveness of direct volume rendering. This paper further promotes the use of differential structure in direct volume rendering, by demonstrating a family of transfer functions based on curvature, using second-order derivatives.</p><p>The theory behind curvature measurement in volume visualization draws from two distinct fields of study. The first is differential geometry. We compute isosurface curvature directly from the volume data using a simple algebraic framework of differential invariants. Additional insight into the underlying field structure comes from geometry orthogonal to the isosurfaces, which is also described by an invariant. The second field of study guiding this work is signal processing and filter design. Numerical differentiation accentuates noise, and the problem increases with the order of the derivative. Care must be taken to measure second derivatives robustly and accurately. We describe a convolution-based derivative measurement scheme which allows control of the tradeoff between accuracy, continuity, and filter size. This curvature measurement method obviates intermediate surface construction, surface parameterization, and explicit finite difference schemes. The ability to compute reliable curvature information at arbitrary points in sampled volume data creates new opportunities for direct volume rendering with curvature-based transfer functions.</p><p>This paper selects different components of curvature information to serve as domain variables in multi-dimensional transfer func- <ref type="bibr">IEEE Visualization 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, October 19-24, 2003</ref>, Seattle, Washington, USA 0-7803-8120-3/03/$17.00 ©2003 IEEE tions. We demonstrate that curvature-based transfer functions enhance the expressive and informative power of direct volume rendering with contributions in three different application areas. Nonphotorealistic volume rendering is improved in Section 5 with contours exhibiting constant thickness in image space, and a flexible method of emphasizing ridge and valley surface creases. Section 6 shows how volume rendering with total curvature provides a technique for studying the behavior of volumetric surface processing algorithms. Section 7 uses flowline curvature as a way to qualitatively indicate regions of high geometric uncertainty in surface models created by isosurfacing.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Curvature Measurement</head><p>The contribution of this section is a self-contained derivation and intuitive explanation of our curvature measurement method, ending with the three simple steps required to put it into practice. The steps can be implemented without perfect understanding of the underlying mathematics. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Monga et al. [1992]</ref>, we rely on convolution with continuous filters, rather than an explicitly constructed coordinate frame aligned with the gradient direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[Interrante 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Nagy et al. 2002]</ref>. We feel our convolution-based approach is significantly simpler than a previous method based on characterizing multiple planar curves passing through the point of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Hladůvka et al. 2000]</ref>. Though visualization results may bene-fit from a pre-process smoothing of the data, no pre-computation is required for the curvature measurement itself.</p><p>The curvature of a surface is defined by the relationship between small positional changes on the surface, and the resulting changes in the surface normal. In sampled volume data, surfaces are implicitly represented as isosurfaces of reconstructed continuous data values f (x). Assuming that the values of f increase as we move further inside objects of interest (e.g., a standard CT scan), the surface normal is defined as n = −g/|g|, with the gradi-</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ent g = ∇ f = ∂ f ∂ x ∂ f ∂ y ∂ f ∂ z T .</formula><p>Curvature information is contained in ∇n T , a 3×3 matrix. However, we do not want to evaluate the gradient of a (pre-computed) normalized vector, since this hinders direct convolution-based measurement of the original data. Expanding upon the derivation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[Mitchell and Hanrahan 1992]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∇n T = −∇ g T |g| = − ∇g T |g| − g ∇ T |g| |g| 2 = − 1 |g| H − g ∇ T (g T g) 1/2 |g| = − 1 |g| H − g ∇ T (g T g) 2 |g|(g T g) 1/2 = − 1 |g| H − g (2g T H) 2 |g| 2 = − 1 |g| I − gg T |g| 2 H = − 1 |g| (I − nn T )H .</formula><p>I is the identity matrix, and H is the Hessian matrix:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">H =   ∂ 2 f /∂ x 2 ∂ 2 f /∂ x∂ y ∂ 2 f /∂ x∂ z ∂ 2 f /∂ x∂ y ∂ 2 f /∂ y 2 ∂ 2 f /∂ y∂ z ∂ 2 f /∂ x∂ z ∂ 2 f /∂ y∂ z ∂ 2 f /∂ z 2   .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The outer product of n with itself, nn T , is a linear operator that projects onto the one-dimensional span of n. I − nn T projects onto the orthogonal complement of the span of n, namely, the tangent plane to the isosurface. Letting P = I − nn T , then</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">∇n T = − 1 |g| PH .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Reading Equation 2 from right to left permits some intuitive understanding of ∇n T . Vector calculus tells us that the Hessian matrix H represents how the gradient g changes as a function of infinitesimal changes of position in R 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[Marsden and Tromba 1996]</ref>. The changes in g have a component along g (the gradient can change length), and a component within the tangent plane (the gradient can change direction). For the purposes of describing curvature, only the latter component matters. It can be isolated with leftmultiplication by P. Finally, the −1/|g| scaling factor converts infinitesimal changes of the (un-normalized) gradient g into infinitesimal changes of the unit-length normal n.</p><p>Both P and H are symmetric matrices, but in general, ∇n T is not symmetric. However, if v lies in the tangent plane, then Pv = v and v T P = v T , so for u and v in the tangent plane,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">v T PHu = v T Hu = u T Hv = u T PHv .</formula><p>That is, the restriction of ∇n T = −PH/|g| to the tangent plane is symmetric, and thus there exists an orthonormal basis {p 1 , p 2 } for the tangent plane in which ∇n T is a 2 × 2 diagonal matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Hoffman and Kunze 1971]</ref>. This basis can be easily extended to an orthonormal basis for all of R 3 , {p 1 , p 2 , n}. In this basis, the derivative of the surface normal is</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">∇n T =   κ 1 0 σ 1 0 κ 2 σ 2 0 0 0   .</formula><p>The bottom row is all zero because no change in position can make the normal n change in length. Motion within the tangent plane, along p 1 and p 2 , leads to changes of n along the same directions, with proportionalities κ 1 and κ 2 respectively. There is no cross-term, or twisting of the normal, by the choice of {p 1 , p 2 }. By the definition of surface curvature <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Do Carmo 1976]</ref>, p 1 and p 2 are the principal curvature directions, while κ 1 and κ 2 are the principal curvatures. As one moves along the normal, off of the surface or deeper into it, the normal tilts according to σ 1 and σ 2 . This aspect of implicit surface curvature, termed flowline curvature by ter Haar Romeny et al. <ref type="bibr">[1991]</ref>, is explored further in Section 7. The above derivation of ∇n T is not novel. Others have exploited the fact that it has eigenvalues κ 1 , κ 2 , and 0 to compute curvature of implicit surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Belyaev et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Preusser and Rumpf 2002]</ref>.</p><p>Multiplying ∇n T by P has the effect of isolating κ 1 and κ 2 in the {p 1 , p 2 , n} basis:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">G = ∇n T P = ∇n T   1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0   =   κ 1 0 0 0 κ 2 0 0 0 0   .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Our surface curvature measurements are based on G, which we term the geometry tensor. In practice, G will be known only in the (X,Y, Z) basis of the volume axes, and will not have the readily transparent form of Equation 3. Matrix invariants provide the leverage to extract the desired curvature values κ 1 and κ 2 from G, regardless of the principal curvature direction coordinate frame. The trace of G is κ 1 + κ 2 . The Frobenius norm of G, notated |G| F and defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">√ trace(GG T ), is √ κ 2 1 + κ 2 2</formula><p>. κ 1 and κ 2 are then found with the quadratic formula.</p><p>To summarize, here are the steps needed to compute curvature at an arbitrary point in a scalar field:</p><p>1.

Though not used in this paper, the principal curvature directions are easily found as eigenvectors of G. The most important task in the curvature computation is measuring all the necessary partial derivatives (in g and H). It is for this task that we use convolution with continuous filters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Measuring Derivatives with Convolution</head><p>Image-order volume rendering of discretely sampled data relies on convolution with continuous filters to reconstruct values at arbitrary locations, such as sample points along a ray. We perform three-dimensional reconstruction as a separable product of onedimensional convolutions along the X,Y, Z axes. The combination of filters used on each axis determines whether the reconstructed quantity is the interpolated data value, or one of its many partial derivatives. Measuring ∂ 2 f /∂ x∂ y, for example, is done with firstorder derivative filters on the X and Y axes, and with a zero-order derivative (interpolation) filter on the Z axis. Accurate curvature measurement depends on a judiciously chosen combination of filters for zero, first, and second derivatives. For reasons of practicality and efficiency, we use piecewise polynomial filters with symmetric support. We apply the filter design framework of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Möller et al. [1998]</ref> to inform the choice of filters. It is the first time the framework has been used to create second derivative filters.</p><p>We review the spatial filter design framework by considering a continuous function f (t) in one dimension. Sampling f (t) at unit intervals produces a sequence of discrete values, notated f [k], where k is an integer. From f [k] we must approximate both the original function f (t), as well as its first and second derivatives f (t) and f (t). Each of the three approximations is done by convolution with a continuous filter. The result of convolving f [k] with continuous filter w(t) is notated f w r (t). By combining the N th order Taylor expansion of f with the convolution definition of f w r (t), <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Möller et al. [1998]</ref> derive:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">f w r (t) = a w 0 f (t) + a w 1 f (t) + a w 2 f (t) + ... + a w N f (N) (t) + r w N<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The a w n are termed error coefficients. From a formulaic standpoint, a w n encapsulates a convolution of w with the n-th term of the sampled Taylor expansion of f .</p><p>From a practical standpoint, however, the vector of error coefficients is the means by which we "dial up" a filter w, according to the desired derivative and accuracy properties. We describe both of these in turn. Looking at Equation 4, we can see that if a filter w does a perfect job of reconstructing f (t), then f w r (t) = f (t), so a w 0 = 1 and all other a w n (as well as the remainder term r w N ) are zero. Similarly, for ideal first (or second) derivative filters, a w 1 (or a w 2 ) is unity, and all other coefficients are zero. The measurement behavior of a filter w is governed by its first non-zero error coefficient. To specify that w should be a d-order derivative filter, we require a w n = 0 for all n &lt; d, and set a w d = 1. In spatial filter design, filter quality is quantified in terms of accuracy: the more accurate a filter is, the higher degree polynomial it can reconstruct exactly. A k th degree error filter (k-EF) filter is one which can exactly reconstruct polynomials of degree k − 1 or lower. In the context of Equation 4, we gain accuracy by requiring one or more of the error coefficients beyond a w d to be zero. To specify that w should be a d-derivative k-EF filter, we let N = d + k and require a w n = 0 for all n : d &lt; n &lt; N. Note that the number of constraints we set (that is, the number of a w n we specify) is the sum of the derivative order and the accuracy level. This also turns out to be the lower bound on the filter support (the number of data value samples required in the convolution sum).</p><p>Continuity is also a desirable filter property, since it avoids visual artifacts in reconstruction, and it helps reduce postaliasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[Marschner and Lobb 1994]</ref>. A continuous filter is C M if it has M continuous derivatives. It can be shown that infinitely many piecewise polynomial filters satisfy any given derivative, accuracy, and continuity requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[Möller 1999</ref>]. The filter w(t) is ultimately implemented as a list of coefficients of piecewise polynomials in t. The coefficients are found as the solution of a linear system embodying the derivative, accuracy, and continuity properties described above <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[Möller 1999]</ref>.</p><p>Spatial filter design supports the creation and characterization of second derivative filters, but unfortunately curvature is not simply a second derivative. Rather, Section 3 showed how curvature is extracted from both first and second derivatives, through algebraic transforms. We have conducted an empirical study to better understand how filter quality affects curvature measurements. Our study used measurements of mean curvature (κ 1 + κ 2 )/2 on the <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Marschner-Lobb [1994]</ref> dataset, a 40 3 sample floating-point volume with isosurfaces resembling a graph of the sinc function.  its second derivative is discontinuous, leading to markedly discontinuous curvature measurements. This example demonstrates how well-regarded reconstruction filters are not always the basis of useful derivative reconstruction filters, especially in the context of second derivatives. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3(b)</ref>, on the other hand, better captures the shape and curvature on the thin ridges, but at the expense of using an 8 3 sample support over which the convolutions are performed. Large filter supports are costly, especially in three dimensions, because of poor memory locality. Finding filters which give good results with reasonable supports is an ongoing research problem.</p><p>Seeking to provide practical advice on a filter set for efficient curvature measurement, we performed a search among the filters (created by the framework above) with 4 3 sample support. Allowing up to 3 rd order continuity (C 3 ) and 4 th order accuracy (4-EF), a total of 200 filter combinations were assessed by rendering the Marschner-Lobb dataset. These renderings (not shown) used an orthonormal projection from directly above the dataset, with shading turned off, to generate grayscale images of mean curvature. Based on the difference between the ideal and rendered curvatures, an "optimal" 4 3 filter set was found; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>(c). An interesting property of this filter set is that for the derivatives, high accuracy is more important than high continuity. For example, there are 4-support 2 nd derivative filters with higher continuity than C 0 , but they are 1-EF, not 2-EF. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>(d) uses another set of filters, also created by the framework above, but better known through the BC-splines of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mitchell and Netravali [1988]</ref>. Interpolation is done by the Catmull-Rom filter (B,C = 0,0.5), which is the only 3-EF (the most accurate) interpolating BC-spline. The first and second derivatives are measured with the first and second derivatives of the cubic B-spline (B,C = 1,0), which is the only C 2 (the most smooth) BC-spline. In our quantitative comparison of 200 filter sets, these did nearly as well as the "optimal" 4 3 filters. Given that any 4 3 sample filter set will be quite limited in the feature detail it can reconstruct and measure, we recommend that when practical considerations dictate a 4 3 support, the filters listed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3(d)</ref> are sufficient; only slightly better results will come from filters with higher polynomial degree.</p><p>When larger filter supports can be employed, higher accuracy is more important than higher continuity. In most practical applications, the underlying data can be sufficiently modeled with low degree polynomials. 3-EF or 4-EF filters should be sufficient; those in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3(b)</ref> are excellent. When measuring derivatives in noisy data, smoothing often improves accuracy. Such smoothing can be a pre-process. Or, it can be folded into the convolution, by slightly blurring values, instead of interpolating them. For instance, instead of using the Catmull-Rom filter as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3(d)</ref>, we can use the B-spline. We have found that the resulting loss of accuracy on very small features is compensated for by the reduction of spurious curvature variations due to noise. For the remainder of this paper, we use the B-spline and its derivatives for our curvature measurements.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Controlling Contour Thickness</head><p>Contours (sometimes referred to as silhouettes) are a basic part of all current approaches to non-photorealistic volume rendering. By emphasizing the transition between front-facing and back-facing surface locations, contours delineate object shape and clarify sites of occlusion. Contours of polygonal surfaces are drawn on edges between faces with different visibilities, as determined by a sign change in v • n, the dot product between the view vector v and the face normal n <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Gooch and Gooch 2001]</ref>. Lacking polygonal discretization, volume rendered contours are generally produced with a univariate function of v • n. For instance, the surface color is darkened when v • n is within some user-determined range around zero. An unfortunate consequence of this approach is uncontrolled variation in the apparent contour thickness. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>, where the surface is nearly flat, a large region of surface normals is nearly perpendicular to the view vector, making the contours too thick. Conversely, in fine structures, where the emphasis provided by contours could be especially helpful, they can be too thin.</p><p>We propose regulating the thickness of volume rendered contours by using curvature. Specifically, the normal curvature along the view direction, κ v , restricts the range of surface normal orientations rendered as contour. We find κ v in terms of the tangent projection P and the geometry tensor G, exploiting the fact that restricted to the tangent plane, G is exactly the Weingarten map <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Do Carmo 1976]</ref>: Contours with approximate image space thickness T are rendered with a two-dimensional transfer function of κ v and v • n. Our method is an approximation because κ v is assumed to be constant over the contour extent. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> illustrates a slice through a surface, on the plane spanned by the surface normal and the view vector as it grazes the surface. Within this plane, m is the single surface normal orthogonal to v. A certain range of surface normals around m must be rendered as contour so that, when projected on the image plane, the contour region appears to have thickness T . This range is a function of T and of R, the radius of curvature at this point along the contour. Letting θ T denote the maximum angle between m and a surface normal within the contour:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">κ v = (Pv) T |Pv| G Pv |Pv| = v T G v |Pv| 2 = v T G v v T P v . θ T R − T R n v</formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">|m • n| ≥ cos(θ T ) ⇒ |v • n| ≤ sin(θ T ) ⇒ |v • n| ≤ R 2 − (R − T ) 2 R = 2RT − T 2 R 2 = T R 2 − T R ⇒ |v • n| ≤ T κ v (2 − T κ v )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Figure 6(a) graphs the inequality in Equation 5; it is simply a portion of a circle. When curvature κ v is small, a narrow range of surface orientations should contribute to the contour, while a larger range of orientations must be colored to create the contour on high curvature features. The lookup table in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>(b) is one way to implement the contour transfer function. High values of κ v are clamped to 1/T to ensure that very small features are not missed. The transition between dark and light in the contour transfer function may be blurred somewhat to soften the contour edges, and to avoid accentuating minor surface variations near the contour. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>: Graph of contour function, and the lookup table used to implement thickness-controlled contours in practice. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>: Thickness-controlled contours, using T = 1 (left) and T = 2.5 (right). <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> demonstrates thickness-controlled contours with two different values for the thickness parameter T . The contour thickness around the ears and back of the bunny are now equal, and the surface details on the lower body are more clearly depicted, in contrast to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>. Also, varying T succeeds in adjusting the image space thickness of the contours. Since the dimensions of T are voxels, setting T = 1 means that contours should be about as thick as the size of one voxel projected onto the image plane. As with previous methods for volume rendered contours, it is possible for our thickness-controlled contours to be drawn at locations where there is actually no change in surface visibility. Also, contours may be drawn improperly in regions where curvature is too low to be measured accurately. We have not found either of these problems to be serious impediments to the illustrative purpose of contours.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">κ v 0 1/T 0 1 |v • n| (a) Contour function κ v v • n −1 0 1 (b) 2-D lookup table</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Emphasizing Valleys and Ridges</head><p>One ingredient missing in the current vocabulary of nonphotorealistic volume rendering techniques is the use of curvature magnitudes to enhance depiction of surface details. Conveying overall surface shape is effectively done by using textures aligned with curvature directions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[Interrante et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Interrante 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Girshick et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lum et al. 2003</ref>], but we wish to avoid the overhead of pre-computing and storing the necessary volumetric texture. Though visually similar to depiction of ridge and valley lines, our approach is simpler than previous volumetric methods in that we do not use third derivatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[Monga et al. 1994]</ref>, nor do we perform a local search to determine curvature extrema <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[Interrante et al. 1995]</ref>. Rather, we work in the two-dimensional space of principal curvatures (κ 1 , κ 2 ), similar to the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hladůvka et al. [2000]</ref>, with the important difference that the geometry tensor can distinguish between convex and concave surface geometry. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref> demonstrates transfer functions of the (κ 1 , κ 2 ) principal curvatures. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref>(a) portrays curvature space with a sequence of quadratic surface patches (each a 20 3 volume) rendered with the transfer function shown. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8(b)</ref> shows how curvature transfer functions can emphasize surface variations not otherwise read-κ 1 κ 2 (a) Volume rendered diagram of (κ 1 , κ 2 ) space.

Following a technical illustration convention of darkening valleys and lightening ridges <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Gooch et al. 1999]</ref>, we darken or lighten volume rendered samples according to their location in (κ 1 , κ 2 ) space, using the transfer function shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8(b)</ref>. In addition to the curvature-based transfer function, Gooch shading is used to convey overall shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Gooch et al. 1998</ref>]. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 9</ref> highlights the complementary nature of our two curvature-based non-photorealistic volume rendering effects. Thickness-controlled contours delineate the shapes of large structures, while ridges and valleys highlight fine surface details. In these renderings, surface color is assigned as a function of three vectors (v, n, l: view, surface normal, light) and three different kinds of curvature (κ v , κ 1 , κ 2 : view direction, principal curvatures). We follow the example of previous work demonstrating the benefit of expressing multi-dimensional transfer functions as the separable product of simpler functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[Kniss et al. 2002]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">RGB(v, n, l, κ v , κ 1 , κ 2 ) = g(n • l) c(κ v , v • n) e(κ 1 , κ 2 ) .</formula><p>Gooch shading comes from g(n • l); c(κ v , n • v) creates thicknesscontrolled contours; e(κ 1 , κ 2 ) provides ridge and valley emphasis. The contour thickness T is the only parameter to tune in c(κ v , v • n). The ridge and valley emphasis does require subjective adjustments, but the intuitive nature of (κ 1 , κ 2 ) space makes this relatively simple. By far the most challenging parameter setting remains the opacity assignment, for which we use a two-dimensional transfer function of data value and gradient magnitude, as guided by previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Kindlmann and Durkin 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kniss et al. 2002]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Visualizing Surface Smoothing</head><p>Medical imaging and three-dimensional range sensing technologies produce high resolution descriptions of object surfaces, but they often suffer from noise. Level set methods for denoising the data have become popular because of their inherent ability to handle complex topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[Osher and Sethian 1988]</ref>. Level sets can be evolved by minimizing an energy function based on principal curvatures, the lowest-order differential invariants of surface shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[Tasdizen et al. 2002]</ref>. Minimizing the surface integral of total curvature κ T = √ κ 2 1 + κ 2 2 gives an isotropic surface smoothing, analogous to Gaussian image blurring. A variant of this energy function can be used to preserve prominent features on the surface while eliminating noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[Tasdizen et al. 2002]</ref>, generalizing anisotropic image diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[Perona and Malik 1990</ref>] to surface processing.</p><p>We propose that curvature-based direct volume rendering is a natural and effective tool for visualizing curvatures and surfaces as they evolve during a level set solution. Level sets and direct volume rendering share an implicit surface representation on a common underlying grid. Because curvature-based volume rendering requires no pre-processing, it permits direct inspection of intermediate smoothing results, without an intervening meshing step. To visualize the spatial and temporal structure of total curvature on the evolving surface, we use two one-dimensional transfer functions. One assigns surface color as a function of total curvature; the other assigns opacity as a function of data value.</p><p>κ T <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>: Six snapshots of anisotropic surface smoothing <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> shows volume renderings of six instances during the anisotropic smoothing of an isosurface from MRI data. All rendering parameters are fixed; only the volume dataset is changing. Noise in the original surface (top-left picture) is seen as randomly distributed high curvature points on the surface. As the surface evolves, most of the high curvature points fade away, while the rest coalesce into prominent creases. This is predicted by mathematical analysis of the anisotropic diffusion equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[Perona and Malik 1990]</ref>. Our visualization experiment verifies this property, as well as illuminating other features of the process. For instance, as the surface smoothly evolves, the network of creases undergoes discrete changes in connectivity. An interesting research topic suggested by these visualizations is steering the energy function in order to create or maintain a particular topology in the crease network. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Visualizing Isosurface Uncertainty</head><p>If a grayscale image is thought of as a height field on which a fluid is flowing downward, flowline curvature is the curvature of the path of the flow, as viewed from above <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[ter Haar Romeny et al. 1991]</ref>. In three dimensions, flowline curvature κ f characterizes the degree to which an isosurface changes its orientation as a function of small changes in isovalue. With zero flowline curvature, adjacent isosurfaces are parallel. Like the principal curvatures, flowline curvature is a differential invariant. However, instead of describing change within a single isosurface, it describes change between isosurfaces. It can be computed from ∇n T (Equation 2):</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">κ f = |∇n T (nn T )| F =   κ 1 0 σ 1 0 κ 2 σ 2 0 0 0     0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1   F = σ 2 1 + σ 2 2 .</formula><p>To our knowledge, flowline curvature has not been used in volume visualization. We propose that flowline curvature can be used to visualize the uncertainty of material boundaries as modeled by isosurface extraction. The physical shape of a boundary between two materials is a fixed and intrinsic property of the object being sampled in the volume dataset. At locations where small changes in isovalue produce large changes in isosurface orientation, the isosurface is probably a poor model of the material boundary. On the other hand, where the shape of an isosurface is robust against small isovalue changes, we can be more certain of its geometric accuracy. By colormapping flowline curvature onto volume rendered surfaces, we can qualitatively indicate uncertainty of surface shape. Regions of especially high flowline curvature are visually flagged as suspect.</p><p>One common material boundary that can be hard to extract via isosurfacing is the surface of bone in CT data. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 11</ref> shows six pseudo-isosurface volume renderings of a thumb. Each is rendered with a univariate opacity function changing from transparent to fully opaque over a narrow range of data values, effectively creating a threshold at the specified isovalue. Flowline curvature is colormapped onto the surfaces through a single transfer function common to all the renderings. The (anatomically erroneous) holes on the bone surface are consistently lined by high flowline curvature, and the sites of hole formation can largely be predicted by flowline curvature patterns at lower isovalues. There are, however, locations with high surface curvature and low flowline curvature, κ f such as the (circled) lower edge of the top bone in the second image. Because there is no single isovalue for which the resulting isosurface has consistently low flowline curvature, these visualizations illustrate how hard it is to find a CT isovalue which represents the bone surface with high certainty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Discussion, Future Work</head><p>We have demonstrated that curvature plays a valuable role in creating informative volume visualizations. Our method conforms to a standard post-classification volume rendering pipeline: the color and opacity assignments at each raycast sample are generated from transfer functions, on the basis of locally computed quantities, such as gradient and curvature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Rheingans and Ebert [2001]</ref> have described how this approach engenders the difficult task of transfer function creation and modification. However, as noted in Section 5.2, we seek to control this complexity by enforcing separability of the transfer function into simpler, intuitive components. The conceptual orthogonality of the various NPR effects maps to orthogonality between the corresponding transfer function domains.</p><p>Biological surfaces tend to be somewhat noisy, and as a result,</p><p>where the surface curvature is very low, as on the scalp or the top of the skull, it is hard to measure curvature accurately. Adaptive methods which measure derivatives over a larger area in such circumstances could help, as could proper application of scale-space methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[ter Haar Romeny et al. 1991]</ref>. As mentioned in Section 4, more analysis is needed to determine the precise relationship between the characteristics of the convolution filters, and the quality of curvature measurements produced. Finally, our proof-of-concept raycaster does not exploit graphics hardware, and is far from interactive. Previous work on hardware-based convolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Hadwiger et al. 2001]</ref> and hardware-based NPR <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[Lum and Ma 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Nagy et al. 2002]</ref>, however, suggests the exciting possibility of highquality curvature measurements at interactive rates.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figures 2shows the analytical form of the data, including colormapping with correct mean curvature values.</figDesc></figure>
