<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Adaptive meshes represent object with level of details varying over the spatial domain. Local level of details is adapted to the application-specific requirements providing sufficiently realistic results with reduced computational efforts. Numerous applications of adaptive meshes include visualization of objects with massive geometrical details, such as terrains <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Duchaineau et al. 1997]</ref> or laser scan data <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Azuma et al. 2003</ref>], physically based simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Debunne et al. 2001]</ref>, iso-surface extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[Wood et al. 2000]</ref>, illumination and radiosity computation, free-form deformations, shape modeling and editing.</p><p>We present a method for construction and incremental update of adaptive semi-regular meshes. Semi-regular mesh is obtained from a coarse triangular mesh applying recursively refinement rule, such as 1-to-4 split <ref type="bibr">[Loop 1987]</ref> or 3-subdivision <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[Kobbelt 2000</ref>]. Semi-regular meshes are inherently multiresolution, have good aspect ratio of triangles and are easy to handle. Our method supports both local refinement and simplification <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. In order to make the refinement reversible, the refinement history is maintained in a hierarchy of triangulations, each triangulation standing for a certain resolution level. The triangulations represent object surface at different resolutions. Each triangulation covers only that part of the surface where the respective resolution is required. When requirements on resolution change, the hierarchy is incre-mentally adjusted. Restrictions are applied to the hierarchy in order to ensure gradual change of the resolution over the surface. Subdivision connectivity of the hierarchy layers allows simple conversion of the hierarchy into the continuous mesh.</p><p>In contrast to adaptive methods based on bisection <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Duchaineau et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Evans et al. 2001]</ref> or quadrisection <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Azuma et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Wood et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Zorin et al. 1997</ref>, our method supports any refinement rule which maps vertices onto vertices and has rotational symmetry, including all N-adic rules such as 1-to-4 split and non-nested rules such as 3-subdivision ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2)</ref>.</p><p>Our second contribution is an out-of-core storage layout useful for manipulating of large scale data sets associated with the mesh, such as data set representing object's geometry. Present day applications often deal with data sets of so large scale, that it is impossible to fit them into the main memory of the computer and they are stored in the external memory, such as disk. External memory is relatively slow and has blocking factor: request of a single record retrieves entire data block (e.g. disk sector). The data blocks are cached by the system and the key to efficient data retrieval is maintaining high cache hit rate. Efficient storage layout is such a permutation of the data set that the data records which have good chances to be requested in subsequent calls are stored in the same data block if possible. Our layout scheme reaches high cache coherency storing resolution layers separately and maintaining geometrical proximity within each level, i.e. storing the data related to the geometrically near vertices in close data cells. The proposed layout is applicable to semi-regular meshes based on arbitrary refinement rules, independent of blocking factor, has no data replication and does not use any data management information such as block index tables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Related Work</head><p>In this section we review existing adaptation and storage techniques and outline the position of the proposed method among them.</p><p>Irregular connectivity meshes have complex topology and are harder in handling. Irregular connectivity cannot be reconstructed with algorithmic rules and should be stored. In order to allow local refinement and simplification irregular mesh is converted to a sort of hierarchic structure. This hierarchy is traversed in runtime to adjust local resolution.</p><p>Progressive mesh representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Hoppe 1996</ref>] is based on atomic operations of edge collapse and its inverse -vertex split. The original finest mesh is converted to the coarsest state with a sequence of edge collapses. Edge collapses are organized into a hierarchy which has the form of forest of trees. Using the hierarchy any intermediate resolution state can be obtained and incrementally updated <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[Xia and Varshney 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hoppe 1998</ref>]. Special refinement criterion can be used to provide good triangle aspect ratios <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[Xia and Varshney 1996]</ref>. The available storage layout techniques for progressive meshes are based on cutting the dependence graph into subtrees. Each subtree is stored in a single data block <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Decoro and Pajarola 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">El-Sana and Chiang 2000]</ref>. It produces good cache behavior since each refinement or simplification operation traverses the hierarchy stepping only one node up or down at a time, which most probably belongs to the same subtree. This storage method requires manual paging in and out of the physical memory.</p><p>There are irregular methods specially developed to care about the mesh quality. In method proposed by de Berg and Dobrindt <ref type="bibr">[1998]</ref> the original fine resolution mesh is converted into a hierarchy of Delauney-optimal meshes representing different detail levels. Adaptive mesh is constructed extracting sections from these meshes and pasting them together into a continuous mesh. Although no incremental technique for adaptation is suggested, it looks like a straightforward extension. The authors state that the storage of the hierarchy requires 3 5 times more space than the storage of the original fine resolution mesh. Method developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Debunne et al. [2001]</ref> generates a hierarchy of high-quality triangulations in the pre-computation phase, one triangulation for each level of details. Refinement and simplification operations simply deactivate a region of one triangulation and activate the same region in the finer or coarser triangulation. The triangulations are independent and have no common vertices. Their method does not produce conforming mesh.</p><p>Semi-regular meshes require only the coarsest level topology to be stored. Fine resolutions are reconstructed applying recursive subdivision. Subdivision connectivity of the resulting meshes automatically provides good triangle aspect ratios. Different refinement rules can be used for subdivision, but up to our knowledge only bisection and quadrisection were exploited in incremental methods.</p><p>Bisection <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Duchaineau et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lindstrom et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Evans et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Velho and Gomez 2000]</ref> is applied to the triangulated quadrilateral meshes, which consist of pairs of right triangles sharing a hypotenuse. Any triangular mesh can be converted to the triangulated quadrangulation increasing number of faces by a factor about of two <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[Velho and Zorin 2001]</ref>. Bisection splits the hypotenuse of a right triangle generating two finer right triangles. In order to keep the mesh continuous, the neighboring triangle sharing the hypotenuse should also be split, which requires the neighbor to be at the same level of subdivision. If the last is not true, forced refinements are used to correct the situation. The resulting hierarchy of right triangles has form of a forest of binary trees. The hierarchy is used to reverse the refinement process. Bisection is an asymmetrical refinement rule -only hypotenuse of the triangles is split.</p><p>1-to-4 split, also referred to as quadrisection and dyadic rule, is a symmetrical operator which can be applied to arbitrary triangular meshes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Azuma et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Wood et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zorin et al. 1997]</ref>. In order to prevent cracks in the mesh conforming edges are inserted after the subdivisions are made. This conformation method is known as red-green refinement <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Bank et al. 1983]</ref>. The resulting hierarchy of triangles has the form of forest of quadtrees. In order to avoid poor shaped triangles, restrictions are applied limiting the difference in subdivision depth between triangles sharing an edge to one <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[Wood et al. 2000]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lindstrom and Pascucci [2001]</ref> present storage layout for the hierarchies based on the bisection rule which groups data by resolution level and stores geometrically close vertices close together in memory. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pascucci and Frank [2001]</ref> use the same principle for rectilinear meshes. Position of a record in the storage is calculated exploiting the subdivision connectivity of the mesh. No manual paging is required and data is accessed with basic I/O or memory mapping functions relying on system caching. Our method extends this approach to the case of semi-regular meshes based on arbitrary refinement rule.</p><p>Our method is a unification of adaptive semi-regular approaches. Similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Debunne et al. [2001]</ref> and de Berg and Dobrindt [1998] a hierarchy of triangulations is exploited, but triangulations are created in runtime and only at the regions where they are actually used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Hierarchical Representation</head><p>Our algorithm deals with two representations of adaptive meshconforming mesh M suitable for application purposes and internal hierarchical representation H introduced to allow reversible refinement of M. Multiresolution operations are firstly performed on H and then mirrored into M. Mesh M is a pair (V, T), where V is a set of vertex positions v i R 3 representing object's shape and T is a triangulation, i.e. set of triangles. Each triangle is a triple t = (i, j, k), where i, j, k refer to vertices</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v i , v j , v k in V.</formula><p>Hierarchical representation H is a tuple</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(V, T 1 , T 2 , …, T L )</formula><p>, where V is the same set of vertices as in M, T 1 is the coarsest triangulation of the entire surface domain, T n , n &gt; 1 is a triangulation resulting from the partial subdivision of T n-1 and represents only that part of the surface where n-th resolution is required. T 1 is static while other triangulations are dynamically changing in runtime following changes in requirements on the local resolution. Pair M n = (V, T n ) is a conforming mesh representing n-th resolution layer <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref>.</p><p>For every t T n we define t.neighbors as a set of references to its neighbors. If some of the neighbors currently do not exist, then triangle is recognized as boundary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Refinement Rules</head><p>Refinement rule is a scheme for generating a portion of T n+1 triangulation when applied to a single t T n triangle. New triangles completely retile the parametric domain of the original triangle t and represent the same surface region with better resolution. The triangles produced by the refinement are referred to as child triangles of t or t.children T n+1 . Backward references are t.parents T n-1 or t.parent if there is only a single parent.</p><p>The vertices referred by t.children and falling into the parametric domain of the parent triangle t are referred to as child vertices or t.childvertices. If a vertex is inserted at the edge between two triangles, it is considered as a child vertex of both. In these definitions the condition t.childvertices = is equivalent to whether t or at least one of t.neighbors is refined.</p><p>Whether triangle t T n is refined is expressed with a binary refinement state t.refined. If t.refined = true, then all t.children exist in T <ref type="bibr">n+1</ref> . Set of refinement states recursively defines the current configuration of the hierarchy as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">t T n , n &gt; 1 p t.parents T n-1 : p.refined = true.</formula><p>We assume that refinement rule is symmetrical and maps vertices onto vertices. This holds for 3-subdivision and 1-to-4 split, as well as all other N-adic and non-nested schemes investigated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alexa [2002]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hart [2000]</ref>  <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2</ref>).</p><p>Different refinement rules result in different parent-child hierarchies. Children triangles produced in the non-nested rules may overlap parent's boundary and hence have multiple parents. In the nested (N-adic) rules every non-root triangle has a single parent. In this case the hierarchy reduces to a forest of trees rooting at T 1 triangles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Restricted Incremental Update</head><p>T n represents surface domain only at the regions where n-th detail level is needed. The need for higher resolution is determined by the application-specific refinement criterion s(t). s(t) = true indicates that the surface region of t T n must be represented with higher resolution, i.e. t must be refined. If non-nested refinement rule is used, then some of t.children may have been already created refining t.neighbors. Hence, the refinement operation inserts the following triangles to the layer T n+1 : (t) = children of t having no other refined parent.</p><p>Simplification operation is the inversion of the refinement and removes (t) from the hierarchy. In the nested rules, (t) = t.children.</p><p>The set of the vertices to be removed or inserted in the local operations is also strictly defined by the refinement states of the neighboring triangles. For example, in 3-refinement the child vertex of a triangle t exists in V if, and only if t or at least one of t.neighbors is refined.</p><p>Refinement routine creates new leaf nodes in the hierarchy and is performed starting from the coarsest mesh, while simplifications are performed in the inverse order: Adapt for n = 1 to L for each t T n : t.refined = false, s(t) = true Refine (t, T n ) for n = L downto 1 for each t T n : t.refined = true, s(t) = false Simplify (t, T n )</p><p>We are interested in good triangle aspect ratios and hence must ensure the gradual change of resolution across the surface. Change of resolution occurs at the boundary triangles. Restricting them to be non-refined: triangle t is boundary t.refined = false, the gradual change of resolution is enforced. When adding or removing triangles, routines Refine and Simplify must ensure that this restriction is not violated. Refinement routine may violate the restriction if applied to triangle t T n having not full set of neighbors. In order to permit refinement and not violate the restriction, the missing neighbors are created with forced refinement of their parents at the coarser triangulation T n-1 . Subdivision connectivity of the meshes allows building strict deterministic procedure for the search of these parents. If refinement rule is non-nested, then neighboring triangles always have a common parent. Since t exists, one of t.parents is in the refined state. Therefore t has a second parent which is not refined. This second parent is to be refined to ensure the restriction, which may result in further recursive refinements at the coarser levels. If refinement rule is nested, then the parents we are looking for are the neighbors of t.parent. These neighbors exist since t.parent is refined and restrictions are applied. Among the three neighbors only those who are the parents of the missing neighbors are refined:</p><p>Simplification routine ensures that (t) are leaves and their removal would not violate the restriction. It can be done checking whether (t) has child vertices. Indeed, deletion of (t) would make neighbors of (t) boundary triangles. If the neighbors are refined, the restriction is violated. Refined neighbors produce child vertices in (t). If (t) have child vertices but does not have refined neighbors, then some of (t) are refined, i.e. (t) are not leaves. Hence, if (t) have children vertices, the simplification is forbidden:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Simplify (t, T n )</formula><p>if none of (t) has child vertices remove (t) from T n+1 remove unused vertices from V set t.refined = false</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Domain Boundary</head><p>If surface domain has boundary, e.g. surface is topologically equivalent to a finite region of plane, the points inserted by the non-nested refinement rule may be positioned outside of the domain. If that happened, the exterior vertices are repositioned onto the domain boundary. Repositioning deforms the mesh producing thin triangles. To prevent further degradation of the triangle aspect ratios in higher resolutions, positions of child vertices is calculated using the original vertex positions. Child triangles lying completely outside of the mesh domain are discarded <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Internal Data Structures</head><p>Adaptation process involves intensive addition and removal of vertices in V and triangles in {T n }. In order to perform them efficiently, arrays of vertices and triangles are enhanced with a stack of references to the empty cells in the array. Every remove operation leaves the cell of the removed element unoccupied and pushes its index to the stack. Insertion operation pops a cell index and fills the cell. If stack was found empty in the insertion call, the array is reallocated to gain new unoccupied cells. Reallocations occur rare enough to disregard their impact on the performance. Hence insertion, deletion and random access are performed in O(1) running time. The dynamic management of resolution layers allows storing only the used mesh elements. Hence, the amount of the allocated memory is proportional to the size of the output mesh, not the size of the finest resolution mesh.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Continuous Mesh</head><p>In this section we discuss how the hierarchy of resolution layers H is converted to the conforming representation M.</p><p>Same surface regions are represented in H with multiple resolutions. Portions of H representing the surface with the highest available resolution contribute to the conforming mesh M directly. Contributions from different resolution levels are not conforming to each other and are seamed with additional triangulations generated along the inter-resolution boundary.</p><p>Reformulating it in formal terms, triangles t H: t.refined = true never contribute to M since the existing t.chidren represent the same surface region better. If t.refined = false but some of t.neighbors are refined (which is equivalent to t.childvertices ) then t is at the inter-resolution boundary and must be retriangulated for conformation. Triangles t H: t.childvertices = have neither better representation nor neighboring higher resolution and contribute to M directly. </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Refine (t, T n )</formula><p>if t is a boundary triangle if refinement rule is nested Refine (p, T n-1 ) for all p t.parent.neighbor, which are the parents of the missing neighbors of t else p = p: p t.parents, p.refined = false Refine (p, T n-1 ) insert new vertices to V insert (t) in T n+1 set t.refined = true  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Conformation Patterns</head><p>Conformation (t) for t T n must be conforming to its neighborhood, i.e. the neighbors of t or their descendants. Due to the restrictions, the only finer triangulation which must be conformed to is T n+1 . Image of t in M is adjacent along an edge of t to the image of the T n+1 triangulation if the appropriate t.neighbor exists and is refined. It results in 2 3 = 8 cases of different possible retriangulations of t.</p><p>Among these eight cases one is equivalent to t.childvertices = which was considered before. Among the rest seven cases some are rotationally symmetrical and finally only three cases must be resolved: one refined neighbor, two refined neighbors and three refined neighbors. Solution depends on the refinement rule used, it can be easily found in the implementation stage and can be hardcoded into the implementation. Example conforming triangulations for a few rules are illustrated on <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Incremental Conformation</head><p>Single refinement and simplification operation changes refinement state of only one triangle t H, hence affects only images of t, t.neighbors and t.children in M. Therefore the effect of every single refinement and simplification operation on H may be directly reflected into M simply updating the image of the affected triangles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Out-of-Core Storage Layout</head><p>In this section we discuss how subdivision connectivity of the adaptive mesh is exploited to reach high performance in the outof-core applications. The following considerations are equivalent in nature to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Lindstrom and Pascucci 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pascucci and Frank 2001]</ref>, but discussed in application to different and more general types of subdivision connectivity.</p><p>The data associated with the mesh vertices is retrieved from the external memory when inserting new vertices into V in the Refine routine. The data retrieval has blocking factor and if each data block contains logically related data, it has good chance to be addressed in the subsequent inquiries. In that case the first inquiry forces system to retrieve the data block and the further inquiries use the cached copy. We consider two aspects of the logical data relation. First, resolution levels are treated separately in the algorithm, the same should apply to the storage grouping data by resolution level. Second, refined regions within a single resolution level are spatially localized and the new refinement most often occurs near the already refined regions. Hence the geometrically close data must be stored in the close data cells.</p><p>We define the data storage layout assigning a unique index t.index to each triangle in H. The index addresses a data record in the external memory representing simply the number of this record in the data set. Each record stores the data associated with triangle t, for example local object space error and coordinates of its child vertices. The data is retrieved using standard I/O or memory mapping interface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Maintaining Geometrical Proximity</head><p>Children of a common parent are always geometrically close to each other. If hierarchy is a forest of d-ary trees as in the case of the nested refinement rules, then geometrical proximity is produced with the following recursive forumation: t.child <ref type="bibr">[i]</ref>.index = d t.index + c with c = 0, …, d 1, <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>: Conforming triangulations for 3-subdivision, 1-to-4 split and 7-subdivision. Grey triangles represent Conformation (t) for t T n drawn in dashes. Conformation (t) is conforming to T n+1 triangles drawn in white.</p><p>where t.child <ref type="bibr">[i]</ref> is the i-th child of t. Triangles t T 1 are assigned indices 0, …, N -1 in arbitrary order, where N is the number of triangles in T 1 . Triangles of T n get unique indices in range 0, …, N d n-1 -1 providing separate indexing of the resolution layers.</p><p>In the case of non-nested rules a triangle may have two parents and then above expression would index the same triangles twice. Ambiguous indexing is avoided choosing for each multiparent child c, which one of c.parents is to be is used for calculation of c.index. In that case d becomes the number of children which are indexed from the triangle, i.e. three for 3-refinement <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6, top)</ref>. Due to the regular and symmetric structure of the refinement rule, the solution is also symmetric and uniform among all the triangles. The example solution is indexing from triangle t each even shared children of t counted clockwise. The odd children in this case are even relative to the neighbors of t <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6, bottom)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> illustrates the resulting degree of geometrical proximity for the case of 3-refinement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Implementation and Results</head><p>In this section we discuss implementations of the proposed algorithm in application to a few different problems. Applications differ in the refinement criterion used, the way the geometry is processed and the purpose the adaptive mesh is then utilized. The performance metrics have been taken on Dell Inspiron 8000 laptop with 900MHz Pentium III processor, 256 MB of RAM and GeForce2 graphics. In real-time applications, graphics was outputted using OpenGL into 640x480 window.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Terrain Visualization</head><p>Adaptive meshes are essential for terrain visualization because of the very large size of the uniform full-detail mesh. In our implementation we present visualization of the entire globe 1 <ref type="figure">(Fig. 10)</ref>. The elevation map was resampled on semi-regular meshes M 1 , …, M 18 , where M 1 is icosahedron and higher are obtained with the 3refinement rule, used for this application. Resulting data set consists of 1.3 billion data points. For the refinement criterion the simplest distant-based error metric enhanced with frustum clipping and back face culling was used (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Lindstrom and Pascucci 2001]</ref>). In order to render shoreline accurately with the Gouraud shading used, the triangles having both sea and land descendants were refined until reaching some minimum projection size. The size of the data record for each vertex was four bytes and included the point elevation and the precalculated local object space error. The conforming mesh obtained with the Flatten routine was directly put to the OpenGL function glDrawElements.</p><p>The performance of the resulting system was nearly linear on the triangle count and reached 15,000 triangles at 30 Hz. This performance was measured disregarding the disk access, i.e. firstly ensuring that all the data requested from the data set in the animation course is already in the disk cache.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Storage Layout Performance</head><p>We compared the performance obtained in 2955 frame flyovers for three different storage layouts -linear, i.e. the original GLOBE data represented in 43,200 x 21,600 matrix, the hierarchical layout presented in Section 4 and the hypothetic ultimate storage layout. The ultimate storage layout is a theoretical construction when the cache miss rate is at the absolute minimum. This is the case when storage layout has so high degree of coherence that the data access happens to be purely sequential and the cache miss occurs only when all blocking factor/record size data records residing in a single block has been subsequently retrieved by the application.</p><p>Our hierarchical storage layout outperforms the linear storage by more than order of magnitude and this performance is close to the optimal -cache miss rate is higher than in the ultimate storage layout by the factor of 2 7 only. For example, for 1k blocking factor (256 records per block), only each 100-th data request results in disk access <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig.8, left)</ref>. In the period of visualization when low resolution queries were predominant the hierarchical layout outperformed the linear layout by two-three orders of magnitude <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 8, center)</ref>. Efficiency of the linear storage scheme drastically degrades when low resolution queries are dominant, while the hierarchic method demonstrates the same performance. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 8</ref> (right) illustrates the cache miss rate measured separately for each resolution layer. The readings show that the efficiency of the hierarchic layout is almost the same when accessing any resolution level, i.e. the layout is scalable and insensitive to the size of the data set given.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Procedural Modeling</head><p>Multiresolution control over the geometry provided by semiregular meshes can be exploited in procedural modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Velho et al. 2002]</ref>. Combining subdivision surface methods <ref type="bibr">[Loop 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kobbelt 2000]</ref> with fractal techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[Mandelbrot 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Musgrave et al. 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr">Prusinkevich and Hammel 1993</ref>] one can substitute the massive data set with simple procedural rules. In our implementation SPHERIGON interpolatory scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[Volino and Magnenat-Thalmann 1998</ref>] was combined with midpoint displacement method <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[Fournier et al. 1982]</ref>. Within this application three different refinement rules have been tested -3refinement, 7-refinement and 1-to-4 split <ref type="figure">(Fig. 9)</ref>. They all performed at about of 20,000 triangles at 30Hz. In 3-refinement the transitions between resolution levels are visually smoother. In contrast to other procedural methods, this approach does not separate the process into the modeling and rendering stages, but provides an integrated approach, constructing the surface details required for the accurate rendering on the fly. Geometric details unused in the animation are never created at all.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Cloth Simulation</head><p>Triangle meshes are used in garment modeling and animation which involves numerical simulation [ <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baraff and Witkin 1998</ref>]. The simulation with uniform high resolution mesh is computationally expensive and the computational cost can be significantly reduced by adapting resolution to the detail levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[Hutchinson et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Debunne et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wu et al. 2001]</ref>.</p><p>Local curvature of the resolution layer was used for triggering the adaptation process. Curvature was estimated as the angle between adjacent triangles belonging to the same resolution layer scaled by the layer resolution. 3-refinement rule was used for the adaptation. In this rule each triangle can have only a single child vertex, which, when inserted into the mesh, was positioned at the centroid of the parent triangle. The mesh adaptation was performed at the start of every simulation step.</p><p>Cloth solver implementation was based on the implicitly integrated continuous model [ <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baraff and Witkin 1998</ref>] with clothrigid and cloth-cloth collision detection and response <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[Volino and Magnenat-Thalmann 2000]</ref>. In the test where an initially flat cloth piece falls on a rigid object, deforms and slides down <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref> triangle count varied between 266 and 3412, mesh reached M 5 resolution level, which covered up to 0.75% of the surface domain. The mesh adaptation process took 9% of the total computation cost. On average, computation of a single step took 1.3 sec. which is 2.6 times faster than in the non-adaptive simulation with uniform M 4 mesh. The quality of the adaptive simulation was slightly lower than in the uniform simulation -some fine wrinkles visually recognizable in the non-adaptive simulation were not observed in the adaptive simulation. These wrinkles are due to the buckling phenomenon and cannot be detected with the curvature based criterion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We have presented an algorithm for incremental refinement and simplification of adaptive meshes using arbitrary refinement rules. The method utilizes hierarchy of semi-regular meshes to manage local adjustments of resolution. The resulting adaptive mesh is always conforming. Conformation method is done in a straightforward and simple manner exploiting subdivision connectivity of the mesh. A simple but nearly optimal multiresolution storage layout scheme was proposed. It adheres to the spatial coherence of the data requests typical for a common application. The versatility of the algorithm has been demonstrated with applications to cloth simulation, real-time terrain visualization and procedural modeling.</p><p>The proposed storage technique manages the full detail data set. In the future work the storage could also be made adaptive to allow playing with the trade-off between accuracy and size of the data set. It is tempting to provide an efficient out-of-core access to the compressed data, e.g. such as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Khodakovsky et al. [2000]</ref>. Mesh adaptation algorithm may be improved to remove explicit storage of the resolution layers and allow performing the multiresolution operations directly on the conforming mesh. Benefits of high-order refinement rules could be explored and exploited more.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :Figure 3 :</head><label>23</label><figDesc>These refinement rules (except of bisection) and many others are supported by our method.
