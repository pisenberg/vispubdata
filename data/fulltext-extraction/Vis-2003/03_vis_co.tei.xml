<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Multiresolution techniques in computer graphics are commonly used for the manipulation of surfaces at various levels of detail. Although many of these surface methods can be generalized for the simplification of volume data, relatively few have been extended for the construction of volumetric multiresolution representations. Many of the existing multiresolution methods apply to hexahedral or tetrahedral meshes and typically require connectivity information. Thus, the direct application of such methods to scattered volumetric data, which contains no connectivity information, is usually not possible.</p><p>We propose a new approach for the construction of a hierarchical representation of any volumetric scalar data set. In a preprocessing step, we iteratively refine an initially coarse representation using clustering techniques to generate a hierarchy. At runtime, we extract levels of detail from this hierarchy to support interactive exploration.</p><p>We start with a coarse data representation, consisting of a single cluster containing all the sample points of the data set. This cluster is partitioned into two sub-clusters, which are inserted into a priority queue sorted by error. This procedure is applied iteratively; in each step, the cluster with the highest error is partitioned, and its sub-clusters are placed into the queue. Refinement terminates when a maximum number of iterations have been completed or when the maximum error in the priority queue is below some user-defined threshold. A hierarchy of clusters is built using the natural parent-child relationship created by this splitting procedure. We refer to the resulting hierarchy as a cluster binary tree (CBT). Field reconstruction and cluster partitioning are discussed in Section 3 and Section 4, respectively.</p><p>The level-of-detail extraction phase consists of a depth-first traversal over the CBT. We discuss two traversal methods: levelbased and error-based. The level-based approach collects data in the hierarchy in a depth-first fashion, traversing the tree down to a user-defined maximum depth. The error-based approach gathers data in the cluster hierarchy based on an error threshold. The set of nodes collected by CBT traversal constitutes a level-of-detail rep- <ref type="bibr">IEEE Visualization 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, October 19-24, 2003</ref>, Seattle, Washington, USA 0-7803-8120-3/03/$17.00 Â©2003 IEEE resentation of the original data. As a result, multiple resolutions are represented by one compact binary tree. Level-of-detail extraction is discussed in Section 5.</p><p>Our goal is to build a multiresolution hierarchy without specific knowledge of the source of the volumetric scalar data. Although this information can often be employed to design more effective algorithms, it reduces the applicability of the method. The strength of our approach is that it can be applied to any volumetric scalar data set and avoids the costly generation of a grid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Although many simplification and multiresolution efforts have focused primarily on surface meshes, many techniques have been developed for volumetric data. Typically, multiresolution methods organize volumetric data based on regular or irregular grid structures. Regular grid structures include octrees, which have been used to provide adaptive levels of detail, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[Shekhar et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Freitag and Loy 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Pinskiy et al. 2001]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Linsen et al. [2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">2003]</ref> used wavelets and subdivision connectivity to represent and visualize regular grid data in a hierarchical fashion. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) techniques use a set of nested regular grids of varying resolution to represent volumes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[Ohlberger and Rumpf 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Weber et al. 2001]</ref>. With respect to irregular grid methods, tetrahedral meshes have played an important role in constructing multiresolution hierarchies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cignoni et al. [1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">1997]</ref> described a system based on tetrahedral meshes to represent and visualize volumetric scalar data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Trotts et al. [1999]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Staadt and Gross [1998]</ref> used edge-collapse techniques to extend <ref type="bibr">Hoppe's work [1996]</ref> for building progressive tetrahedrizations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Grosso and Greiner [1998]</ref> built hierarchical adaptive meshes using tetrahedra and octahedra.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of these methods cannot be applied directly to scattered data-i.e., data with no connectivity informationwithout first meshing the scattered data points or resampling the data to a regular grid. Tetrahedrizations can be expensive to compute and store, especially considering the increasing size of modern scientific data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Weber et al. [1999]</ref> proposed creating local triangulations at runtime in a given region of interest. While this approach provides a good solution for runtime visualization of scattered data, it does not lend itself to the construction of a multiresolution representation of volume data. Further, tetrahedrization algorithms can be difficult to implement in practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[Shewchuk 1997</ref>], as they require complex mesh data structures to be maintained <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[Pauly et al. 2002]</ref>.</p><p>Resampling to a regular grid can produce many unnecessary redundancies, although adaptive sampling via an octree or an AMR representation can help. Regular grids typically sample in an axisaligned fashion, which, though simple to implement and store, may not always produce a desirable partitioning of the volume. Grid data and multiresolution methods for grid data offer several advantages when exploring large data spaces, but these methods are not always easily generalized for all types of volume data. For example, methods for tetrahedral meshes can be applied to hexahedral meshes by decomposing hexahedra into tetrahedra, but the reverse is not true. The most general type of volumetric data is scattered data. Thus, any multiresolution method for scattered data could be applied to any gridded data by simply ignoring the mesh.</p><p>To create a multiresolution hierarchy for scattered scalar data, it is desirable to use methods that use "simple" connectivity, or no connectivity at all. Similar methods have been developed in surface simplification, surface reconstruction, and vector field hierarchy creation. These methods partition data points into similar sets, or clusters. Inspired by vector quantization methods, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Brodsky and Watson [2000]</ref> used PCA to simplify models by refining an initially coarse representation. Their work prompted <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Shaffer and Garland [2001]</ref> to apply PCA-based vertex clustering and the dual quadric error metric to simplify models adaptively in an out-of-core fashion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Pauly et al. [2002]</ref> developed several extensions of multiresolution methods for point-sampled surfaces. <ref type="bibr">Heckel et al. [1999a]</ref> used PCA to determine near-planar polygonal tiles for the reconstruction of surfaces from point cloud data. Vector field hierarchies were constructed using PCA in a similar way by clustering vectors that are locally similar <ref type="bibr">[Heckel et al. 1999b]</ref>.</p><p>One major issue in constructing a volumetric hierarchy from scattered data is the question of value approximation at arbitrary locations in the domain. In the absence of connectivity, radial basis functions (RBFs) are traditionally used to reconstruct a field. Hardy's multiquadric and reciprocal multiquadric methods have been used successfully for many scientific applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Hardy 1990</ref>]. RBFs have been used in knot optimization for complex surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Franke et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Franke and Hagen 1999]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Carr et al. [2001]</ref> have demonstrated the usefulness of RBFs in surface reconstruction.</p><p>In our approach, we refine clusters of scattered data points using PCA to define partitioning planes intelligently. While the use of PCA is not new in surface simplification <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Brodsky and Watson 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Shaffer and Garland 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Pauly et al. 2002]</ref>, we extend PCA for use in volumetric scalar field simplification. We maintain a point hierarchy, similar in spirit to many multiresolution representations of surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[Rusinkiewicz and Levoy 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Pauly et al. 2002]</ref> with the exception that our points represent samples of a scalar field and not samples on a surface. We use RBFs defined using levels of detail from this point hierarchy for field reconstruction and value approximation.</p></div>

This method effectively fits a function composed of a set of radial basis functions (RBFs) to the scattered data using least-squares approximation to derive function constants and a reparameterization of the data points.</p><p>To estimate the function values, we utilize an approximation of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F (x, y, z) = c + N j=1 aj Bj(x, y, z),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Bj(x, y, z) = [ (xj â x) 2 + (yj â y) 2 + (zj â z) 2 + R 2 ] Â± 1/2 , subject to the constraints F (xj, yj, zj) = Fj j = 1, 2, . . . , N .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>We call c the correction constant, R the multiquadric parameter, and aj the blending coefficients. The points pj are often referred to as knots. The value of N is the number of data points used for value approximation. Classically, a global fit is performed by setting N to be the same as |C|, which can be computationally expensive for large clusters. We use a local scheme by considering only the N nearest neighbors to p, i.e., N = min( |C|, k ), where k is some threshold. Often, equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>is too strict, and a least-squares fit is performed instead.</p><p>In the classic implementation of this algorithm, a minimization</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">min {knots,R,a j ,c} N i=1 c + N j=1 aj Bj(xi, yi, zi) â Fi 2</formula><p>is performed, which is separated into two minimization steps:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">min {knots,R} min {a j ,c} N i=1 c + N j=1 aj Bj(xi, yi, zi) â Fi 2 .</formula><p>The inner minimization step is performed by a least-squares operation. The outer minimization step is non-linear <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Franke et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Franke and Hagen 1999]</ref>. This optimization leads to values for c, <ref type="bibr">R, aj, and knots (xj, yj, zj)</ref>. The value at p is estimated using equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">1</ref>.</p><p>Our experiments have shown that this method works well but is computationally intensive. The least-squares fitting procedure requires solving an N Ã (N + 1) linear system, i.e., an underdetermined system with an infinite number of solutions. A nonnegativity constraint can be added, however one must be careful to avoid near-singular matrices. The major bottleneck is the nonlinear optimization, which attempts to optimize 3N + 1 variables: the x-, y-, and z-components for the N knot locations and R.</p><p>To reduce computational cost, we have applied simplifications to the approximation method that do not sacrifice overall approximation quality and allow the knots to stay fixed. First, we neglect the correction constant c. In geometric modeling, the correction constant is used to smooth "bumpy" surfaces. However, we wish to preserve "sharp" features and not smooth them away. By removing the correction constant c, we obtain an N Ã N linear system and no longer need to consider an underdetermined matrix problem. Second, we increase the local neighborhood for function value estimation. We have found that increasing the neighborhood eliminates the need to optimize knot locations. For instance, we obtain near-equivalent results using 25 nearest neighbors without knot optimization when compared to using five neighbors with knot optimization. Finally, the multiquadric parameter R is defined to be a constant. Our experience shows that optimization routines frequently set R to values so small that it is of negligible influence. Thus, setting the multiquadric parameter to a sufficiently low value eliminates the need for non-linear optimization. The blending coefficients, in many cases, compensate for any effect that the multiquadric parameter has.</p><p>Thus, the local approximation of the scalar field at (x, y, z) is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">F (x, y, z) = N j=1 aj Bj(x, y, z),</formula><p>where we determine each aj by solving</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">min {a j } N i=1 N j=1 aj Bj(xi, yi, zi) â Fi 2 .</formula><p>For each cluster, we evaluate F at the cluster center pc to compute Fc, the scalar field approximation at pc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Clusters</head><p>Given a cluster C, we define its error Ïc as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Ïc = max p j âC | Fj â Fc | Y X Y X (a)<label>(b)</label></formula><p>Figure 2: Comparison of splitting schemes. Black dots represent points with scalar value one, and white dots represent points with scalar value zero. (a) Non-optimal splitting using an axis-aligned scheme, (b) near-optimal splitting.</p><p>where Fj is the scalar value associated with point pj, and Fc is the value approximated at cluster center pc. In other words, the error Ïc is the maximum deviation in scalar value between the approximated value and the values of all points in C. This error measure is simple to compute and suffices to identify clusters to be refined.</p><p>In each refinement step, the cluster with the highest error is obtained from the queue. We partition it into two smaller clusters by defining a splitting plane that divides the cluster into two distinct subsets. Center points, value approximations at center points, and errors are computed for the two resulting sub-clusters. The subclusters are then inserted into the queue. A binary tree is maintained during refinement by setting the sub-clusters to be children of the cluster just split. In this hierarchy, each cluster is interpreted as a data point of a given resolution in the hierarchy whose location is the cluster center pc.</p><p>One possible refinement strategy uses an axis-aligned scheme. In this method, the cluster center and one coordinate axis determine the splitting plane. This k-D tree style splitting scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[Samet 1990</ref>] is efficient and allows us to determine the splitting plane simply, but it may not produce a good decomposition of the data set. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> demonstrates this effect. Furthermore, we wish to define a splitting plane that reduces the error in the sub-clusters the most. We use the cluster center and a normal vector obtained from principal component analysis (PCA) on all four components of the scalar field <ref type="bibr">(xi, yi, zi, Fi)</ref> to define a more adaptive splitting plane. For a detailed explanation of PCA, we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[Jolliffe 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr">Heckel et al. 1999a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Brodsky and Watson 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Shaffer and Garland 2001]</ref>.</p><p>We first discuss how 3-D PCA can be used for bivariate scalar fields. For bivariate scalar field data (xi, yi, Fi), we can perform PCA in 3-D to obtain an orienting normal for a splitting line. PCA performs an eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix of a set of samples producing, in the 3-D case, eigenvalues Î»1 â¥ Î»2 â¥ Î»3 and corresponding eigenvectors e1, e2, and e3, which define a local orthogonal coordinate system related to an ellipsoid induced by the data points. We use the vector corresponding to the dominant axis of this ellipsoid, i.e., e1, as the splitting plane's normal. However, to partition the 2-D points in the domain, we require a 2-D normal vector. We project the 3-D eigenvector to xy-space, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>. In most cases, we obtain a suitable normal by simply dropping the last component of the eigenvector.</p><p>We must consider the case when e1 is a multiple of the vector 0, 0, 1 . Such a vector projected to xy-space produces the null vector. In this case, we choose the second dominant eigenvector, e2, which is guaranteed to be non-null when projected to xy-space, since it is orthogonal to e1. In practice, this occurs infrequently. (This never occurred in the results presented in Section 7.) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  4</ref> illustrates the progression of the cluster splitting procedure.</p><p>This technique generalizes to trivariate scalar field data <ref type="bibr">(xi, yi, zi, Fi)</ref>. PCA returns eigenvalues Î»1 â¥ Î»2 â¥ Î»3 â¥ Î»4 with corresponding eigenvectors e1, e2, e3, and e4. Again, we use the projection of e1 to xyz-space to define a splitting plane normal. When projection of e1 maps to the null vector in xyz-space, we choose e2 as our orienting normal.</p><p>Defining the splitting plane in this way divides a cluster across the axis of its greatest variation, thereby decreasing the cluster's error. Geometrically speaking, this partitioning splits one ellipsoid into two "rounder" child ellipsoids with reduced eccentricity. This shape can have an important positive side-effect on subsequent partitioning. When clusters become very thin in the split direction, it is possible that splitting a cluster produces a sub-cluster with no data points due to numerical error. Splitting across the dominant axis as defined by PCA avoids the creation of thin clusters by producing sub-clusters that are as "round" as possible. This numerical issue cannot be avoided completely; when it occurs, the "problem cluster" is not re-inserted into the error queue.</p><p>Cluster size can also have an effect on splitting. Eventually, clusters contain only a few data points. A minimum cluster size can be defined to set a "pseudo-compression ratio" for the finest resolution in the data hierarchy. Defining a minimum cluster size can also reduce the occurrences of the zero-size cluster problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Level-of-detail Extraction</head><p>Extraction of levels of detail from the CBT is performed by traversing the tree in a depth-first fashion, using either a level-based traversal that obtains the clusters in the hierarchy at a given level of the tree, or an error-based traversal that returns clusters in the hierarchy that have an error below a threshold. If a leaf node is encountered in the CBT during extraction, we use the cluster at the leaf and continue traversal. When traversing the CBT in a level-based manner, levels of detail are specified by the maximum depth to traverse the binary tree. When traversing the CBT in an error-based manner, levels of detail are specified by a maximum error that the level-of-detail should exhibit. (The hierarchy can only guarantee clusters with an error less than or equal to the maximum error at the termination of the preprocessing.) With the error metric we have defined, a low error threshold returns a high fidelity representation. Conversely, a higher error threshold returns a less faithful but memory efficient representation.</p><p>Error-based traversal offers a more compact representation, whereas the level-based approach provides better spatial distribution by covering the space spanned by the hierarchy with more data points. This phenomenon can be seen in the examples shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref> and is further discussed in Section 7. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref>, two levels of detail are shown for each traversal method. Between two resolutions of the hierarchy traversed in a level-based way, additional points are added in a spatially uniform manner. Between two resolutions of an error-based hierarchy, the distribution of the additional points depends more strongly on the nature of the field. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref> demonstrates this effect for a silicium data set. In the error-based traversal examples ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5, right column)</ref>, only a few clusters are extracted to represent the volume outside the silicium structure, whereas several more clusters are used in that same region using a level-based approach ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5, left column)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Multiresolution Representation</head><p>The clusters extracted from the CBT define a level-of-detail representation of the volume by considering the pc and Fc for each cluster as locations and values of a scattered scalar field. This set of data points, in conjunction with the field reconstruction basis functions described in Section 3, allows us to evaluate the function at any arbitrary location, and thus construct visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Results</head><p>We generated CBT hierarchies for three data sets. We extracted low-and high-resolution levels of detail from each CBT and volume rendered the fields to inspect the quality of the representation. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes the preprocessing results to generate the CBTs. For value approximation at the cluster centers and for sampling the data, we used 25 nearest neighbors and fixed the multiquadric parameter to 0.025. The minimum splittable cluster size was set to two. All function values are between zero and 255. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows volume rendered visualizations of different levels of detail represented by the CBTs. The first column shows a volume rendering of the original data. Columns two and three provide volume visualizations of high and low resolutions, respectively. Information concerning the parameters used to extract these levels of detail and the number of data points used for rendering is provided in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. To illustrate the quality of the various resolutions, "zooms" are given for the argon bubble data set in <ref type="figure">Figures 6(l)</ref>, (m), and (n), and difference images are provided for the silicium data set in <ref type="figure">Figures 6(d)</ref> and (e). The difference images were obtained by differencing images in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>(b) and (c) against image (a) of the original data set.</p><p>This method lends itself to data and computation parallelism. Once a cluster is split, its sub-clusters can be further split on separate machines. Since the hierarchy is based on a binary tree, merging the final results is low in cost. For each data set, preprocessing was performed in parallel on a hybrid PC cluster consisting of three machines with Pentium4 2.8 GHz processors with 2 Gb of main memory, and one machine with a Pentium4 2.2 GHz processor with 1 Gb of main memory.</p><p>As mentioned in Section 4, eventually clusters either converge to the granularity of the data set or suitable partitioning is not pos-sible due to lack of precision. "Skipped splits" can result in the refinement, and their numbers are listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Naturally, lower resolutions are less faithful to the original data set. This fact is seen in the results for the head data set, shown in <ref type="figure">Figures 6 (f)</ref>, (g), and (h). A low-resolution representation produces a low-quality volume rendered result as seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 6(h)</ref>, where the entire back plate from the scan is not represented in detail. Although less than one percent of the number of data points (17,528 data points) was used to construct the image, salient features of the head, such as the eye sockets and spikes around the teeth, are still discernible. Deficiencies of low resolutions are eliminated in higher resolutions, as seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>(g).</p><p>The images shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> of the silicium data set demonstrate some of the differences between error-based and level-based hierarchies. The argon bubble and head results were generated using an error-based approach, whereas the silicium data set results were generated using level-based extraction. As can be seen in the difference images, <ref type="figure">Figures 6(d)</ref> and (e), successively higher resolutions of the data set improve the overall quality of the field representation but not any particular region. By contrast, the images of the head demonstrate that successively higher resolutions of the error-based hierarchy adaptively improve specific regions. The back plate and nose appear "blobby" in Figure 6(h) and not in (g), while the regions around the teeth and eye socket remain fairly consistent across resolutions.</p><p>Levels of detail of the argon bubble data set exhibit high-quality using few data points. In the low and high resolutions of the data set, shown in <ref type="figure">Figures 6(i)</ref>, (j), and (k), less than five percent of the number of the original data points was used to reconstruct the field. Zooms shown in <ref type="figure">Figures 6(l)</ref>, (m), and (n) illustrate the quality of the representation.</p><p>Running time depends on the nature of the data being processed and the parameters used. Although one could attempt to analyze the performance as a function of the input data size, the limiting factor with most any simplification algorithm is the inherent complexity of the data set itself. Compared with data sets with relatively small variation in scalar value, data sets with large variation in scalar value do not converge as quickly to meet the error threshold. In the CBT generation phase, the primary bottleneck is value approximation at the cluster centers. We provide timing results in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for the preprocessing of the data used. We emphasize that the running time of data preprocessing is strongly dependent on the nature of the data set and the parameters used for preprocessing; it is much less affected by the input data size. As an example, the argon bubble data set, although larger in size, required much less time than the head data set to preprocess, see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. However, the parallel nature of the method allows us to achieve better performance through the use of additional processors.</p><p>The CBT's space requirement is linear with respect to the number of iterations, since each iteration of the refinement process adds at most two new members to the cluster hierarchy. The time required to obtain a given resolution of the data from the cluster hierarchy is the time required to traverse the CBT, which is O( 2p + 1 ), the time to perform a depth-first traversal in the worst case, where p is the number of nodes in the tree. Extracting lower resolutions from the data hierarchy requires less time due to the traversal termination conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusions</head><p>We have presented a method for the creation of a multiresolution hierarchy for discrete scalar field data through iterative refinement. The method uses clustering techniques to construct a data hierarchy. The refinement termination condition can be based on a userdefined upper bound for the number of iterations or on an error threshold. Levels of detail are extracted from the hierarchy using one of two depth-first tree traversal methods. Additional modes of data extraction could be defined by storing other parameters in the cluster hierarchy, such as gradient, function value range spanned by a cluster, or spatial range covered by a cluster. This flexibility allows one to customize the hierarchy to conform to application specific needs. To what degree these parameters can be used to enhance visualization is a topic for future work.</p><p>The methods described do not rely on explicit connectivity information, and this fact is the primary strength of this approach. The algorithm can be applied to any type of volumetric scalar data regardless of the presence of connectivity information and without the use of complex mesh data structures. The multiresolution hierarchy can be constructed for large data sets as well, since cluster hierarchy generation can be done in parallel.</p><p>We plan to explore the effectiveness of different error metrics and optimal placement of the splitting plane. We used a simple error metric, effectively the Lâ norm, to determine which clusters exhibit largest scalar error. A study of the effect on hierarchical clustering of different measures, such as the L1 or L2 norms, should be done. We used the cluster centers to specify a splitting plane. The use of other locations, such as the median point of the cluster, might have an interesting effect on the simplification process.</p><p>This method can be used to explore features and optimize sampling locations in arbitrary data. Since the cluster with the largest error is split at each iteration, dense clustering occurs in regions of high scalar value variation, and fewer clusters appear in lower variation regions. By virtue of this characteristic, this method has potential for feature detection. Different features could be tracked by applying, for example, a transfer function filter to the scalar values prior to hierarchy generation. Different error metrics and extraction routines could further enhance detection of features. This algorithm can be used to optimize sampling locations in volumetric data due to its adaptive nature. More splitting occurs in regions of high scalar variation. Thus, by observing where the hierarchical clustering method places more data points, one could intelligently resample a given data set using more optimal sampling locations obtained from the preprocessing step. n/a n/a 5,242,880 100 % <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Statistics for visualizations shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.
