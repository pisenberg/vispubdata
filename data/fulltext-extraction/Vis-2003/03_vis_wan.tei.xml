			<abstract>
				<p>In this paper, we propose a quasi-static approximation (QSA) approach to simulate the movement of the movable object in 6degrees-of-freedom (DOF) haptic rendering. In our QSA approach, we solve for static equilibrium during each haptic time step, ignoring any dynamical properties such as inertia. The major contribution of this approach is to overcome the computational instability problem in overly stiff systems arising from numerical integration of second-order differential equations in previous dynamic models. Our primary experimental results on both simulated aircraft geometry and a large-scale real-world aircraft engine showed that our QSA approach was capable of maintaining the 1000Hz haptic refresh rate with more robust collision avoidance and more reliable force and torque feedback.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, the problem of simulating real-world engineering tasks, such as maintainability assessment of engineering design, has been studied in haptics research, the science of virtual touch, the latest frontier in virtual reality <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[McLaughlin et al. 2002]</ref>. Tool and part manipulation in these tasks inherently requires challenging 6-DOF haptic rendering with a real-time performance of 1000Hz haptic refresh rates because objects are free to move in three translational and three rotational directions.</p><p>Most existing high-performance 6-DOF haptic rendering methods can be divided into two categories: geometric-primitive-based haptic rendering and voxel-sampling-based haptic rendering. The former renders virtual objects represented by traditional geometric primitives, such as polygons or NURBS primitives, while the latter renders voxelized virtual objects with surface point samples or renders volumetric environments that are popular in medical applications. * {ming.wan | bill.mcneely}@boeing.com Modeling with polygons offers greater spatial accuracy than can be attained using voxels. However, polygon-based 6-DOF haptic rendering is subject to severe performance barriers that limit its practical applicability, for example, by imposing a convexity requirement that constrains scenarios to 10~100 pairs of convex primitives <ref type="bibr">[Gregory et al. 2000]</ref>. A single concave object such as a dish antenna or a helical-spiral tube may decompose into hundreds or thousands of convex primitives, depending on modeling accuracy. Recently, Otaduy and Lin proposed a novel "sensation preserving" simplification algorithm that reached noticeable performance improvement in update rates compared to exact contact query algorithm, with little degradation in the haptic perception of contacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[Otaduy and Lin 2003</ref>].</p><p>Nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) primitives offer superior spatial accuracy for 6-DOF haptics, but at the cost of even greater performance barriers and shape constraints. This approach has so far demonstrated the ability to simulate only relatively lowcomplexity scenarios that may not contain surface slope discontinuities such as sharp edges [Nelson and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cohen 2000]</ref>.</p><p>The voxel-sampling-based 6-DOF haptic rendering imposes neither formal shape constraints nor complexity constraints on the static objects. For geometric objects from CAD models, it offers a good approximation method at reduced accuracy; while for volumetric data, such as CT or MRI data used in medical visualization, it provides a nature and accurate approach. It has demonstrated the ability to drive a commercially available 6-DOF prototype device at a reliable 1000 Hz haptic refresh rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[McNeely et al. 1999]</ref>. Therefore, it is different from the intermediate representations for haptics suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Adachi et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mark et al. 1996]</ref>, which involves using a simple haptics proxy that approximates the exact scene and is simple enough to update the forces at the required high refresh rate, while a slower but more exact collision detection and dynamic simulation runs asynchronously and updates the proxy's prarmeters. The best measure of success of this approach is that it enables haptic simulation of complex engineering tasks that cannot be simulated by any other known means short of physical mockup.</p><p>As described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[McNeely et al. 1999]</ref>, the high performance of the voxel-based approach is derived primarily from a single-body dynamic model and a memory-efficient fixed-depth voxel tree. To solve the motion of the dynamic object, the dynamic model performs a numerical integration of the Newton-Euler equation, using a constant time step as small as 1 msec for 1000 Hz haptic refresh rate. Although it supports efficient collision detection and real-time force feedback, this dynamic model suffers from certain fundamental problems inherent in most dynamic-based algorithms, as pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[McNeely et al. 1999]</ref>. For example, whenever many intersections occur simultaneously between the movable object and the virtual environment, the penalty-force <ref type="bibr">IEEE Visualization 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, October 19-24, 2003</ref>, Seattle, Washington, USA 0-7803-8120-3/03/$17.00 Â©2003 IEEE stiffness may become so large that it provokes haptic instabilities associated with fixed-time-step numerical integration.</p><p>In this paper we propose an efficient QSA approach to replace Newtonian single-body dynamics, which avoids computational instability in overly stiff systems arising from numerical integration of second-order differential equations in dynamic models. It solves for static equilibrium during each haptic time step, ignoring any dynamical properties such as inertia. Static equilibrium is found for a system of collision penalty forces plus a spring-based virtual coupler for haptic control. This exclusive use of spring forces ensures that QSA yields a linear problem in the number of degrees of freedom at each time step.</p><p>Retaining its fundamental stability advantage, our QSA approach avoids the heuristics prescribed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[McNeely et al. 1999</ref>] to prevent numerical instability due to penalty force stiffness buildup, as well as the "braking force" to dissipate momentum prior to contact. Compared to the dynamic model, QSA keeps the high performance of 1000 Hz haptic refresh rate, but with more robust collision avoidance and more reliable force and torque feedback. It is also simpler to implement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Quasi-Static Approximation</head><p>We use a quasi-static approximation (QSA) of single-body dynamics for rapidly computing an approximation to the motion of objects in a haptic display collision-detection system. Specifically, the movable object is coupled to a virtual haptic handle. The forces acting on the object are the sum of collision forces and the external forces from the handle. The forces from the handle are based on the offset in position and orientation between the handle and the object, but are clipped almost immediately upon contact to avoid pushing the object through obstacles. At each time step, a linear approximation to the changes in both collision force and external force are computed; this approximation ignores new collisions and released collisions and also the nonlinear effects of rotation. The object is placed at the location where the linear system predicts that collision force will cancel the clipped external force from the virtual handle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Single-Body Kinematics</head><p>In our QSA approach, static equilibrium is found for a system under the influence of two simulated force/torque pairs (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, where only forces are drawn for simplicity): a penalty force/torque pair from a virtual penalty-force spring during contacting, and a haptic force/torque pair from a virtual haptic spring created from the user motion of the haptic handle, as explained below.</p><p>To compute the penalty force and torque acting on the dynamic object, we adopt the tangent-plane force model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[McNeely et al. 1999]</ref>. In this model, the movable object is represented by a set of surface point samples, plus associated inward pointing surface normals, while the environment of static objects is represented by a single spatial occupancy map using voxels. When a point interpenetrates a voxel, a depth of interpenetration is calculated as the distance d from the point to a plane within the voxel called the tangent plane. The tangent plane is dynamically constructed to pass through the voxel center and to have the same normal as the point's associated normal. The penalty force on this point is simply proportional to d by Hooke's law. The net penalty force and torque acting on the movable object are obtained as the sum of all force/torque contributions from such point-voxel intersections. We adopt the virtual-coupling scheme to calculate the haptic force and torque applied on the dynamic object, which is a well-known method for enhancing haptic stability, originally proposed by Colgate et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Colgate et al. 1993</ref>] and later elaborated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adams and Hannaford [Adams and Hannaford 1998</ref>]. In this scheme, a copy of the haptic handle is placed in the virtual scene and is coupled to the movable object through a virtual (haptic) spring. The real haptic handle controls the position and orientation of its virtual counterpart. This influences the haptic spring's displacement, which generates the haptic force/torque on the movable object and an opposite force/torque on the real haptic handle. Specifically, the haptic force is proportional to the displacement of the haptic spring, while the haptic torque is proportional to the angle of rotation from an equivalent-angle analysis and directed along an equivalent axis of rotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Craig 1989</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Static Equilibrium</head><p>Assume that at each time step, the incremental motion of the movable object is a combination of a translational movement d</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(d x , d y , d z ) and a rotational movement r (r x , r y , r z )</formula><p>, where r is a rotational axis K scaled by a rotational angle Î¸, i.e., r = Î¸K; that is, a total of six free variables,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d x , d y , d z , r</formula><p>x , r y , and r z , are to be determined by solving for static equilibrium in a system of spring forces, as described in Section 2.1.</p><p>The basic idea to determine the six variables can be described as follows.

When the movable object reaches static equilibrium during the current time step, point P moves from P i to a new location, say Q i , with a movement d i .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Haptic Force and Torque</head><p>We derive the symbolic representations of haptic force and torque at equilibrium respectively from the displacement of the virtual haptic spring, and from the equivalent angle and axis between the movable object and the virtual haptic handle, by using the virtual coupling model. First, we assume that at the beginning of the current time step, the displacement of the haptic spring is d H , and that the equivalent angle and the equivalent axis between the movable object and the virtual haptic handle are Â¢ H and K H . Â¢ H and K H can be computed from the orientations of the movable object and the virtual haptic handle at the beginning of the current time step by employing the equivalent angle-axis analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Craig 1989</ref>].</p><p>Then, at equilibrium, the displacement d e of the virtual haptic spring can be represented as <ref type="figure">(d H -d)</ref>, where d is the translational movement of the movable object during the current time step.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Net Force and Torque at Equilibrium</head><p>Because net force and torque are zero for static equilibrium, we obtain the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">0 ) , ( ) , ( = + r d F r d F haptic coll (9) 0 ) ( ) ( = + r d haptic coll Ï Ï (10)</formula><p>Combining them with Equations 4, 5, 6, and 8, we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Center of mass Tangent plane Surface voxel dop i N i V i P i Q i d i R i 0 ) ( ) , ( = â + d d k N r d dop k H d i i i (11) 0 ) ( ) ( ) , ( = â + Ã Â¡ r r k N R r d dop k H i i i i Î¸ (12)</formula><p>In our current QSA model, all penalty-force stiffness i k are set to unity, and the haptic-spring stiffness k d and kÂ£ are set to positive values using a technique described in Section 2.3. Finally, by substituting dop i from Equation 3 into Equations 11 and 12, we obtain six linear equations with the six free variables from vectors d and r. We then rapidly solve for the six variables through, for example, the Gaussian elimination.</p><p>An important side effect of using F haptic and Â¡ haptic in our QSA model is to shield the solution from any singularities due to geometrical symmetries in the scenario, which guarantees a unique single solution for the six linear equations. For example, in the absence of F haptic and Â¡ haptic , the solution for a sphere resting upon a flat surface is intrinsically degenerate in all variables in r. However, F haptic and Â¡ haptic pull the sphere toward the current position and orientation of the haptic handle at all times, even when the sphere would not "know" which way to move in the presence of symmetries. The ultimate degeneracy is free space, in which case the solution is determined trivially by setting both F haptic and Â¡ haptic to zero.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Virtual Coupling</head><p>The haptic-spring stiffness, including both translational stiffness k d and rotational stiffness kÂ£ introduced before, represent haptic influence over the translation and rotation of the dynamic object. They implement a virtual coupling between haptic and virtual worlds. Unlike the spring-damper type of coupling that is indicated for a dynamic model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[McNeely et al. 1999</ref>], our QSA model needs only a 6-DOF spring. In the real world (i.e., at the haptic interface), output force/torque is proportional to the negative of the 6-DOF spring force/torque (by Newton's third law), with proportionality constants set to the maximum linear/torsional stiffness that can be stably rendered by the haptic device. In the virtual world, however, the 6-DOF spring must not be allowed to overpower the penalty-force spring because that could cause object interpenetration. This means that haptic spring stiffness may be considered constant during the current time step but needs to be updated on a frame-by-frame basis, depending on the haptic displacements at the beginning of the time step.</p><p>We first specify the desired equilibrium behavior as a function of haptic spring displacement and then derive spring stiffness from it. To ensure that the haptic spring never overpowers the penaltyforce spring, this process must be carried out for the worst case of minimum penalty-force stiffness. For translation, the worst case is a scenario consisting of only a single point-voxel contact, while for rotation it is two opposing point-voxel contacts separated by the smallest meaningful moment-arm distance R min (as discussed in more detail below).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Translational Stiffness of the Virtual Spring</head><p>Consider first the translational stiffness k d of the haptic spring. Our QSA model represents k d as a function of the haptic-spring displacement d H at the beginning of the current time step.</p><p>We seek to derive the function k d (d H ) to cover the case of resting contact, in which the user pulls the movable object into slight penetration before reaching equilibrium. Accordingly, we must first specify the depth of penetration at equilibrium, dop EQ , as a function of d H , as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3a</ref>. At large displacements it should asymptotically approach a maximum value, dop max , representing a conservatively small penetration distance less than one-half of a voxel that also yields a subjectively satisfying level of haptic control; empirically, one-tenth of a voxel is one such value. At small displacements the haptic-spring stiffness should approach equality with penalty-force stiffness. Our desired behavior for dop EQ can be expressed by the following choice of function of d H : It can be shown easily that static equilibrium for the worst-case scenario of a single point-voxel contact corresponds to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">) 1 ( ) ( max / max dop d H EQ</formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">H H EQ H d d d dop d k / ) ( ) ( =<label>(14)</label></formula><p>Function <ref type="figure">Figure 3b</ref>. It has a representational singularity at d H = 0, where the limiting value of unity implies that the haptic spring and penalty-force spring approach equal stiffness at zero displacement. Note that k d is always positive because the spring is attractive and never repulsive.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">k d (d H ) is illustrated in</formula><p>In order to avoid surface stickness effect, function</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">k d (d H ) in</formula><p>Equation 14 should apply only when the user pushes the movable object into contact. We consult the net penalty force F coll to determine whether haptic-spring displacement d H causes the movable object approaching contact or receding from a prior contact. As a result, the final solution for k d is: <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Haptic spring properties.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Â£ Â¤ Â¥ &lt; â â = â¥ â = . 0 ), ( ; 0 , 1 coll H coll H d d coll H d F d if F d k k F d if k (15) (a) function dop EQ (d H ) (b) function k d (d H )</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rotational Stiffness of the Virtual Spring</head><p>Similarly, we represent the rotational stiffness kÂ£ as a function of the equivalent angle Â¢ H and the equivalent axis K H between the movable object and the virtual haptic handle at the beginning of the current time step, by using the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">Î¸ Î¸ Î¸ H e H EQ â â = (18) H d ) ( H d d k 1 max dop max dop ) ( H EQ d dop max dop 0 0 H d | | / ) ( ) 2 ( ) ( min H H EQ H R k Î¸ Î¸ Î¸ Î¸ Î¸ = (19)</formula><p>where R min represents the moment arm of the worst case scenario. In our implementation, R min is set to 3s, where s is the voxel size, which anticipates the worst-case torque scenario, such as a smalldiameter shaft that passes snugly through a hole, including a surface offset that must be added to preclude exact-surface interpenetration as prescribed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[McNeely et al. 1999]</ref>.</p><p>We further avoid rotational stickiness effect by using an equation similar to Equation 15, but consulting the net penalty torque Â¡ coll and the equivalent axis K H instead.</p><p>Before finishing our discussion on virtual coupling, we would like to point out that, although rarely encountered in practice, scenarios with sufficiently large mechanical leverage may also allow the haptic influence to overpower the collision influence and cause interpenetration. Forcing an object into a narrow wedge-shaped cavity is an example of this problem. A remedy to avoid such interpenetration is to dynamically adjust the penaltyforce stiffness i k of individual points in Equations 11 and 12.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experimental Results</head><p>Our real-time haptic rendering system has been implemented under both Microsoft WindowsÂ® and SGI IRIXÂ®. We limit the following discussion to results obtained using an SGI OctaneÂ® with two 250 MHz R10000 processors and 2 GB of RAM. Haptic rendering using a 6-DOF QSA model was performed on one processor to assert updated force and torque information to the haptic device and read position and orientation of the haptic handle in a closed loop running at 1000 Hz, using a PHANTOMÂ® Premium 1.5 with 6-DOF haptic interface made by SensAble Technologies, Inc. The host application is a GLUT-based visualization system, which uses the second Octane processor to maintain an interactive image-rendering rate of 10~20 Hz to display the virtual scenario.</p><p>During our tests, the QSA approach showed the same 1000 Hz haptic refresh rate as the dynamic model did, while the former provided a more stable haptic rendering. Our QSA approach also required less amount of implementation work by avoiding to calculate, for example, the pre-contact braking force in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[McNeely et al. 1999]</ref>.</p><p>One of the virtual scenarios for our testing was a simulated aircraft geometry, which consisted of a static environment with beams, tubes, and wires as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 4</ref>. The polyhedral representation of the static environment contained 25.7K polygons. It yielded 176,220 surface voxels when voxelized at 0.1 inches resolution.</p><p>The movable object for much of our testing was the red valve, which contained 4.6K polygons and yielded 4,754 points when voxelized at 0.1 inches resolution. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 4a</ref> shows the initial position of this movable object in free space. A virtual haptic handle (the short green rod) is aligned with the primary axis of the dynamic object. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 4b</ref> shows the movable object in contact with the static environment. The red valve's surface is colored by consulting the distance to contact, with brighter colors indicating smaller distance. The virtual haptic handle (in pink) is apart from the dynamic object, which influences the behavior of the movable object through a virtual spring. We tested the haptic stabilities and exact-surface interpenetrations by trapping and sliding the valve in congested areas and by staging high-speed collisions. We experienced a smooth and nature force and torque feedback without any object interpenetration.  Another virtual scenario we tested was a large-scale real-world aircraft engine ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). The engine contains three long thin systems called fire detectors that are routed in and around other systems and structures, staying as close to the engine core as possible. An engine design requirement was to determine whether each fire detector could be removed from its installed position for routine maintenance with little or no disassembly of its surrounding environment.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, the fire detector is a slender multi-colored (mostly green) object that runs from the lower left corner to the lower right corner. The fire detector's surface is colored with warmer colors indicating smaller distance to contact. This scenario contains 1.26M polygons, which were discretized at 3.5 mm</p></div>

All three fire detectors had similar results, and we report here on one of them, which has a maximum dimension of about 2 m and is represented by 15,300 points when voxelized at 3.5 mm resolution. The engineering users tried both the automated path planning capability of General Electric's GalileoÂ® software product and our 6-DOF haptic simulator on this same problem. The former ran for 4 days without finding any removal path; By using our 6-DOF haptic simulation capability, users successfully found the desired paths in 3~6 minutes per detector. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Fire detector removal.</p><p>Throughout the removal of the fire detector, we paid particular attention to motion behavior and quality of force and torque feedback. Both force and torque feedback were clearly felt and soon became critical to performing such a challenging task simulation. This was best demonstrated by temporarily disabling force/torque feedback so that objects were still prevented from interpenetrating, but the sole feedback became visual. In this mode, no users were able to perform the fire-detector removal simulation, although they could perform it with haptic feedback enabled. While one cannot rule out the hypothesis that a more sophisticated form of visual feedback (e.g., selective X-ray vision of the moving object) might change this result, we believe that haptic feedback will always remain a powerful adjunct to visual feedback, especially in busy environments with much occlusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>This paper presents an efficient quasi-static approximation approach, which supports high haptic stability during real-time 6-DOF haptic rendering. Although our approach may not be exactly physically realistic, it produces a more stable collision response than the previous dynamic models, which is more important than physically accurate response for a range of applications. Our experimental result showed that our approach on a 6-DOF haptic device was capable for maintenance and assembly task simulations on both simulated and large-scale real-world engineering geometry.</p><p>So far, we have limited our 6-DOF QSA approach on a single moving object inside a static virtual environment. In the future, we will extend this approach to handle multiple moving objects.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>A movable object under the influence of both penalty force F coll and haptic force F haptic .</figDesc></figure>
