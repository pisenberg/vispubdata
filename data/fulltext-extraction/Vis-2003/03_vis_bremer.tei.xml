				<p>We combine topological and geometric methods to construct a multi-resolution data structure for functions over two-dimensional domains. Starting with the Morse-Smale complex, we construct a topological hierarchy by progressively canceling critical points in pairs. Concurrently, we create a geometric hierarchy by adapting the geometry to the changes in topology. The data structure supports mesh traversal operations similarly to traditional multiresolution representations.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The efficient construction of simplified geometric models is a central problem in visualization. This paper describes a multiresolution data structure representing a continuous function over a two-dimensional domain. An example of such data is a terrain over a planar domain or over a sphere (e.g., the Earth). The distinguishing feature of this data structure is the fusion of topological and geometric measurements driving its construction.</p><p>Motivation Scientific data often consists of measurements over a geometric domain or space. We think of it as a discrete sample of a continuous function over the space. We are interested in the case in where the space is a compact 2-manifold. Examples of such data are elevation data and the electrostatic potential on a molecular surface.</p><p>A multi-resolution representation is crucial for efficient and preferably interactive exploration of scientific data. The traditional approach to constructing such a representation is based on progressive data simplification driven by a numerical measurement of the error. Alternatively, we may drive the simplification process with measurements of topological features. We refer to the former as the geometric and the latter as the topological approach to multi-resolution representations. The latter approach is appropriate if topological features and their spatial relationships are essential to understand the phenomena under investigation. An example is water flow over a terrain, which is influenced by possibly subtle slopes. Small but critical changes in the landscape may result in catastrophic changes in water flow and accumulation. There are applications beyond the analysis of measured data. For example, we may artificially create a continuous function over a surface and use that function to guide the segmentation of the surface into patches.</p><p>Related work The topological analysis of scientific data has been a long standing research focus. Morse-theory-related methods have already been developed in the 19th century <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Cayley 1859;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Maxwell 1870]</ref>, long before Morse theory itself was formulated, and hierarchical representations have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[Pfaltz 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pfaltz 1979]</ref> without making use of the mathematical framework developed by Marston Morse and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[Morse 1925;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Milnor 1963]</ref>. However, most of this research was lost and has been rediscovered only recently. Most modern research in the area of multi-resolution structures is geometric and many techniques have been developed during the last decade. The most successful algorithms developed in that era are based on edge contraction as the fundamental simplifying operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[Hoppe 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Popovic and Hoppe 1997]</ref> and accumulated square distances to plane constraints as the error measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Garland and Heckbert 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lindstrom and Turk 1998</ref>]. This work focused on triangulated surfaces embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space, which we denote as R 3 . We find a similar focus in the successive attempts to include the capability to change the topological type of the surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[He et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">El-Sana and Varshney 1998</ref>]. If we interpret the surface as the zero-set of a continuous function over R 3 we may interpret such operations as smoothing or simplifying this function. This point of view was taken in a sequence of recent papers on the topic [Gerstner and Pajarola 2000; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Guskov and Wood 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ju et al. 2002]</ref>, but the simplification is limited to a small neighborhood of the zero set. We extend the focus to the simplification of an entire function, which is equivalent to removing spurious topological features from all level sets simultaneously. To obtain a mathematical formulation of this process, we interpret the critical points of the function as the culprits responsible for topological features that appear in the level sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[Fomenko and Kunii 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bajaj and Schikore 1998</ref>]. While sweeping through the level sets we see that critical points indeed start and end such features, and we may use the length of the interval over which a feature exists as a measure of its importance. For the special case of two-dimensional height fields this measure was first proposed by Horman <ref type="bibr">[1971]</ref> and later adopted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mark [1977]</ref>. We use the more general concept of persistence introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Edelsbrunner et al. 2002]</ref>. In this view, the Morse-Smale complex of the function domain occupies a central position. Its construction and simplification is studied for 2-manifolds in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Edelsbrunner et al. 2001]</ref> and for 3-manifolds in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Edelsbrunner et al. 2003</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We follow the approach taken in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Edelsbrunner et al. 2001]</ref>, with some crucial differences and extensions. Given a piecewise linear continuous function over a triangulated 2-manifold, we 1. construct a decomposition of the 2-manifold into monotonic quadrangular regions by connecting critical points with lines of steepest descent; <ref type="bibr">IEEE Visualization 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, October 19-24, 2003</ref>, Seattle, Washington, USA 0-7803-8120-3/03/$17.00 ©2003 IEEE 2. simplify the decomposition by performing a sequence of cancellations ordered by persistence; and 3. turn the simplification process into the construction of a hierarchical multi-resolution data structure whose levels correspond to simplified versions of the function.</p><p>The first two steps are discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Edelsbrunner et al. 2001]</ref>, but the third step is new. Nevertheless, this paper makes original contributions to all three steps and in the application of the data structure to concrete scientific problems. These contributions are (i) a modification of the algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Edelsbrunner et al. 2001]</ref> that constructs the Morse-Smale complex without the use of handle slides;</p><p>(ii) the simplification of the complex by simultaneous application of independent cancellations;</p><p>(iii) a numerical algorithm to construct geometric realizations of the patches in the graph of the simplified function;</p><p>(iv) a low-depth multi-resolution data structure combining the simplified versions of the function into a single hierarchy;</p><p>(v) an algorithm for traversing the data structure that combines different levels of the hierarchy to construct adaptive simplifications; and (vi) the application of our software to various scientific data sets.</p><p>The hallmark of our method is the fusion of the geometric and topological approaches to multi-resolution representations. The entire process is controlled by topological considerations, and the geometric method is used to realize monotonic paths and patches. The latter plays a crucial but sub-ordinate role in the overall algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>We describe an essentially combinatorial algorithm based on intuitions provided by investigations of smooth maps. In this section, we describe the necessary background, in Morse theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[Milnor 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Matsumoto 2002]</ref> and in combinatorial topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[Munkres 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alexandrov 1998</ref>].</p><p>Morse functions Throughout this paper, M denotes a compact 2-manifold without boundary and f : M → R denotes a real-valued smooth function over M. Assuming a local coordinate system at a point a ∈ M, we compute two partial derivatives and call a critical when both are zero and regular otherwise. Examples of critical points are maxima ( f decreases in all directions), minima ( f increases in all directions), and saddles ( f switches between decreasing and increasing four times around the point).</p><p>Using again the local coordinates at a, we compute the Hessian, which is the matrix of second partial derivatives. A critical point is non-degenerate when the Hessian is non-singular, which is a property that is independent of the coordinate system. According to the Morse Lemma, it is possible to construct a local coordinate system such that f takes the form f (x 1 , x 2 ) = f (a) ± x 2 1 ± x 2 2 in a neighborhood of a non-degenerate critical point. The number of minus signs is the index of a and distinguishes the different types of critical points: minima have index 0, saddles have index 1, and maxima have index 2. Technically, f is a Morse function when all its critical points are non-degenerate and have pairwise different function values. Most of the challenges in our method are rooted in the need to simulate these conditions for functions that do not satisfy them in a literal sense.</p><p>Morse-Smale complexes Assuming a Riemannian metric and an orthonormal local coordinate system, the gradient at a point a of the manifold is the vector of partial derivatives. The set of gradients forms a smooth vector field on M, with zeroes at the critical points. At any regular point we have a non-zero gradient vector, and when we follow that vector we trace out an integral line, which starts at a critical point and ends at a critical point while not containing either of them. Since integral lines ascend monotonically, the two endpoints cannot be the same. Because f is smooth, two integral lines are either disjoint or the same. The set of integral lines covers the entire manifold, except for the critical points.</p><p>The descending manifold of a critical point a is the set of points that flow toward a. More formally, it is the union of a and all integral lines that end at a. For example, the descending manifold of a maximum is an open disk, that of a saddle is an open interval, and that of a minimum is the minimum itself. The collection of stable manifolds is a complex, in the sense that the boundary of a cell is the union of lower-dimensional cells. Symmetrically, we define the ascending manifold of a as the union of a and all integral lines that start at a.</p><p>For the next definition, we need an additional non-degeneracy condition, namely that ascending and descending manifolds that intersect do so transversally. For example, if an ascending 1-manifold intersects a descending 1-manifold then they cross. Due to the disjointness of integral lines, this fact implies that the crossing is a single point, namely the saddle common to both. Assuming this transversality property, we overlay the two complexes and obtain what we call the Morse-Smale complex, or MS complex, of f . Its cells are the connected components of the intersections between ascending and descending manifolds. Its vertices are the vertices of the two overlayed complexes, which are the minima and maxima of f , together with the crossing points of ascending and descending 1-manifolds, which are the saddles of f . Each 1-manifold is split at its saddle, thus contributing two arcs to the Morse-Smale complex. Each saddle is endpoint of four arcs, which alternately ascend and descend around the saddle. Finally, each region has four sides, namely two arcs emanating from a minimum and ending at two saddles and two additional arcs continuing from the saddles to a common maximum. It is generically possible that the two saddles are the same, in which case two of the four arcs merge into one.'</p><p>Piecewise linear functions Functions are abundant in scientific problems, but they are rarely smooth and mostly known only at a finite set of points spread out over the manifold. It is convenient to assume that the function has pairwise different values at these points. We assume that the points are the vertices of a triangulation K of M, and we extend the function values by piecewise linear interpolation over the edges and triangles of K. The star of a vertex u consists of all simplices (vertices, edges and triangles) that contain u, and the link consists of all faces of simplices in the star that are disjoint from u. Since K triangulates a 2-manifold, the link of every vertex is a topological circle. The lower star contains all simplices in the star for which u is the highest vertex, and the lower link contains all simplices in the link whose endpoints are lower than u. Note that the lower link is the subset of simplices in the link that are faces of simplices in the lower star. Topologically, the lower link is a subset of a circle. We define what we mean by a critical point of a piecewise linear function based on the lower link. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, the lower link of a maximum is the entire link and that of a minimum is empty. In all other cases, the lower link of u consists of k + 1 ≥ 1 connected pieces, each being an arc or possibly a single vertex. The vertex u is regular if k = 0 and a k-fold saddle if k ≥ 1. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> for k = 2, a k-fold saddle can be split into k simple or 1-fold saddles. Persistence We need a numerical measure of the importance of critical points that can be used to drive the simplification of a Morse-Smale complex. For this purpose, we pair critical points and use the absolute difference between their function values as importance measure. To construct the pairing, we imagine sweeping the 2-manifold M in the direction of increasing function value. This view is equivalent to sorting the vertices by function value and incrementally constructing the triangulation K of M one lower star at a time. The topology of the partial triangulation changes whenever we add a critical vertex, and it remains unchanged whenever we add a regular vertex. Barring some exceptional cases that have to do with the surface type of M, each change either creates a component or an annulus or it destroys a component (by merging two) or an annulus (by filling the hole). We pair a vertex v that destroys with the vertex u that created what v destroys. The persistence of u and of v is the time-lag between the two events:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p = f (v) − f (u).</formula><p>An algebraic justification of this definition and a fast algorithm for constructing the pairs can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Edelsbrunner et al. 2002]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Morse-Smale complex</head><p>We introduce an algorithm for computing the MS complex of a function f defined over a triangulation K. In particular, we compute the ascending and descending 1-manifolds (paths) of f starting from the saddles, and use them to partition K into quadrangular regions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Construction of 1-manifolds</head><p>Starting from each saddle, we construct two lines of steepest ascent and two lines of steepest descent. We do not adopt the original algorithm proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Edelsbrunner et al. 2001]</ref> and follow actual lines of maximal slope instead of edges of K. In particular, we split triangles to create new edges in the direction of the gradient.</p><p>Additionally, we avoid degenerate cases where the interior of a region is not connected. This situation can happen even when following steepest ascent/descent lines since f is not smooth and integral lines can merge. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>(a) shows one such case, where paths merge at junctions and disconnect the interior of a region into two. To deal with this problem we allow a pair of paths to join only when they are both ascending or descending. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>(b) shows how this strategy avoids disconnected regions.</p><p>After computing all paths, we partition K into quadrangular regions forming the cells of the MS complex. Each quadrangle is extracted from K with a simple region-growing strategy that starts from a triangle incident to a saddle and never crosses any 1-manifold.</p><p>Diagonals and diamonds The central element of our data structure for the MS complex is the neighborhood of a simple saddle or, equivalently, the halves of the quadrangles that share the saddle as one of their vertices. To be more specific about the halves, recall that in the smooth case each quadrangle consists of integral lines that emanate from its minimum and end at its maximum. Any one of these integral lines can be chosen as diagonal to decompose the quadrangle into two triangles. The triangles sharing a given saddle form the diamond centered at the saddle. As illustrated in maximum minimum saddle junction <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Portion of the MS complex of a piecewise linear function. Since the gradient is not continuous, (solid) ascending and (dotted) descending 1-manifolds can meet in junctions and share segments. (Left) Complex with no restrictions on sharing segments. The green region touches only one saddle, and the red one is disconnected. (Right) Only 1-manifolds of the same type can meet. The interior of each region is connected and touches both saddles.</p><p>Figure 6(a), each diamond is a quadrangle whose vertices alternate between minima and maxima around the boundary. It is possible that two vertices are the same and the boundary of the diamond is glued to itself along two consecutive diagonals.</p><p>Robustness We carefully design a global algorithm that always produces consistent results. Especially in degenerate areas of M, where several vertices may have the same function value, the greedy choices of local steepest ascent/descent may not work consistently.</p><p>For example, a 1-manifold can be lead into a dead end or can force endless splitting of edges in the triangulation. We address this problem using a technique based on the simulation of simplicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Edelsbrunner and Mücke 1990]</ref>. We orient each edge of K in the direction of ascending function value. Vertex indices are used to break ties on flat edges such that the resulting directed graph has no cycles. Now, the vertices of K can be treated as if they were in general position. The search for the steepest path is therefore transformed to a weighted-graph search. When searching for an ascending path only ascending edges or triangles with at least one ascending edge are considered. The function values are only used as preferences when they agree with the edge labels. Thus, our algorithm is stable even for highly degenerate data sets as the one shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. We compute the descending paths starting from the highest saddle and the ascending paths starting from the lowest saddle. Thus, when two paths aim for the same extremum, the one with higher persistence (importance) is computed first. The boundary of the data set is artificially tagged as a path. The complete algorithm is summarized in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. T = {F, E,V }; //T riangulation, Faces, Edges, V ertices M = P = C = {}; //quasi-MS complex, Paths, Cells initializeArrows(T ); //initializing simulation of simplicity S = findSaddles(T ); S = splitMultiSaddles(T ); sortByHeight(S); ∀s ∈ S in ascending order: computeAscendingPath(P); ∀s ∈ S in descending order: computeDescendingPath(P); while ( f in F not touched) growRegion( f ,p 0 ,p 1 ,p 2 ,p 3 ); //p i are bounding paths createMorseCell(C,p 0 ,p 1 ,p 2 ,p 3 ); M = connectMorseCells(C); <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Sequence of high-level operations used to create an MS complex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Hierarchy</head><p>Our main objective is the design of a hierarchical data structure that supports adaptive coarsening and refinement of the data. In this section, we describe such a data structure and discuss how to use it.</p><p>Cancellations We use only one atomic operation to simplify the MS complex of a function, namely a cancellation that eliminates two critical points. The inverse operation that creates two critical points is referred to as an anti-cancellation. In order to cancel two critical points they must be adjacent in the MS complex. Only two possible combinations arise: a minimum and a saddle or a saddle and a maximum. The two configurations are symmetric and we can limit the discussion to the second case, which is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Let u be the saddle and v the maximum of the canceled pair, <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>: A portion of the graph of a function before (left) and after (right) canceling a maximum and a saddle. and let w be the other maximum connected to u. We require w = v and f (w) &gt; f (v) or otherwise prohibit the cancellation of u and v. We view the cancellation as merging three critical points into one, namely u, v, w into w. The four paths ending at u are removed and the remaining paths ending at v are extended to w. The reason for requiring f (w) &gt; f (v) should be clear. First, it implies that all paths remain monotonic, except the paths extended from v to w, which will be fixed by numerical methods explained in Section 5. Second, we do not eliminate any level sets and only simplify the level sets between f (u) and f (v) by merging the component around v into the component surrounding w. We may think of a cancellation as deleting the two descending paths of u and contracting the two ascending paths of u.</p><p>Node removal We construct the multi-resolution data structure from bottom to top. The bottom layer stores the MS complex of the function f , or rather the corresponding decomposition of the 2manifold into diamonds. diamonds. Each node has degree four, but there can be loops starting and ending at the same node. A cancellation corresponds to removing a node and re-connecting its neighbors. When this node is shared by four different arcs we can connect the neighbors in two different ways. As illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>, this operation corresponds to the two different cancellations merging the saddle with the two adjacent maxima or the two adjacent minima. There is only one way to remove a node shared by a loop and two other arcs, namely to delete the loop and connect the two neighbors.</p><p>(a) (c) (b) (B) (A) <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>: A four-sided diamond (a) can be zipped up in two ways: from top to bottom (b) or from left to right (c). A folded diamond (A) can be zipped up in only one way (B).</p><p>To construct the hierarchy by repeated cancellation, we use the algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Edelsbrunner et al. 2002</ref>] to pair critical points as tu-</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ples (s 1 , v 1 ), (s 2 , v 2 ), . . . , (s k , v k )</formula><p>, with persistence increasing from left to right. Let Q j be the MS complex obtained after the first j cancellations, for 0 ≤ j ≤ k. We obtain Q j+1 by modifying Q j and storing sufficient information so we can recover Q j from Q j+1 . The hierarchy is complete when we reach Q k . We call each Q j a layer in the hierarchy and represent it by activating its diamonds as well as neighbor and vertex pointers and de-activating all other diamonds and pointers. To ascend in the hierarchy (coarsen the quadrangulation) we de-activate the diamond of s j+1 , and to descend in the hierarchy (refine the quadrangulation) we activate the diamond of s j−1 . Activating and de-activating a diamond requires us to update a constant number of pointers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent cancellations</head><p>We generalize the notion of a layer in the hierarchy to permit view-dependent simplifications of the data. The key concept here is the possibility to interchange cancellations. We will see that the most severe limitation to interchanging cancellations derives from the assignment of extrema as vertices of the diamonds and from re-drawing the paths ending at these extrema. To understand this limitation, we introduce the cancellation graph whose vertices are the minima and maxima. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 6(c)</ref> shows an example of such a graph. For each diamond there exists an edge connecting the two minima and another edge connecting the two maxima. There are no loops and therefore sometimes only one edge per diamond. Zipping up a diamond corresponds to constricting one of the edges and deleting the other, if it exists. One endpoint of the edge remains as a vertex and the other disappears, implying that the diamonds that share the second endpoint receive a new vertex. A special case arises when a diamond shares both endpoints: the connecting edge that would turn into a loop is deleted.</p><p>Two cancellations in a (possibly simplified) MS complex are interchangeable when there is no difference between the data structure generated by the two orderings of the operations. For example, the two cancellations zipping up the same diamond are not interchangeable since one preempts the other. In general, two cancellations are interchangeable when their diamonds share no vertex, a condition we refer to as being independent. Note that two interchangeable cancellations are not necessarily independent. Even though independence is the more limiting of the two concepts, it offers sufficient flexibility in choosing layers to support the adaptation of the representation to external constraints, such as the biased view of the data.</p><p>The more independent cancellations we can find the more freedom we have in generating layers in the multi-resolution data structure. Ideally, we would like to identify a large independent set and iterate to construct a shallow hierarchy. However, in the worst case, every pair of cancellations is dependent, which makes the construction of a shallow hierarchy impossible. As illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 9(a)</ref>, such a configuration exists even for the sphere and for any arbitrary number of vertices. Nonetheless, worst-case situations are unlikely to arise as they require that a large number of folded diamonds. Specifically, it is possible to prove that every MS complex without folded diamonds implies a large independent set of cancellations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Geometric approximation</head><p>After each cancellation, we create or change the geometry that locally defines f . We pursue three objectives: the approximation must agree with the given topology, the error should be small, and the approximation should be smooth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Error bounds</head><p>We measure the error as the difference between function values at a point. It is convenient to think of the graph of f as the geometry and this difference as the (vertical) distance between the original and the simplified geometry at the location of the point. The persistence of the critical points involved in a cancellation implies a lower bound on the local error. We illustrate this connection for the one-dimensional case in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 8(a)</ref>. Recall that the persistence p of the maximum-minimum pair is the difference in their function values. Any monotonic approximation of the curve between the two critical points has an error of at least p/2. We can achieve an error of p/2, but only if we accept a flat segment for this portion of the curve, see the blue curve in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 8(a)</ref>. When it is allowed to exceed p/2, smoother approximations without flat segments are possible, such as the green curve in the same figure. We note that one can always construct a monotonic approximation that minimizes the error everywhere. However, this approximation is only C 0 -continuous for 1-manifolds, as shown by the red curve in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 8(a)</ref>, and it may fail to be continuous for 2-manifolds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data fitting</head><p>We know that monotonic patches exist, provided we are tolerant to errors. Our goal is therefore to find monotonic patches that minimize some error measure. A large body of literature deals with the more general topic of shape-constrained approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Carlson and Fritsch 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Greiner 1991]</ref>, but due to critical differences (in particular in the notion of monotonicity) we were not able to adapt standard techniques for our purposes. Instead, we use a multi-stage iterative approach to construct the geometry that specifies the simplified representation of f . It provides a smooth C 1 -continuous approximation within a specified error bound along the boundaries of the quadrangular patches and a similar approximation but without observing an error bound in the interior of the patches. The paths are constructed iteratively by smoothing the gradients along the edges and post-fitting the function values, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 8(b)</ref>. During each iteration, we first compute the new gradient of an edge as a convex combination of its gradient and the gradients of the adjacent edges. We then adjust the function values at the vertices to realize the new gradients. During an iteration, we maintain the error bound at the vertices and make sure that the completed path is monotonic. In addition, the gradient at the critical points is set to zero. The technique performs well in practice although it converges slowly. Sample results are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9(b)</ref>. The interior of the quadrangular patches are modified by applying standard Laplacian smoothing to the function values <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[Taubin 1995]</ref>. During each iteration, the value at a vertex is averaged with those of its neighbors. Since the boundaries are monotonic, this procedure converges to a monotonic solution for the patch interior. We now summarize the steps of the geometry fitting process:</p><p>1. find all paths affected by a cancellation;</p><p>2. use the gradient smoothing to geometrically remove the canceled critical points;</p><p>3. smooth the old regions until they are monotonic;</p><p>4. erase the paths and re-compute new paths using the new geometry;</p><p>5. use one-dimensional gradient smoothing again to force the new paths to comply with the constraints; and 6. smooth the new regions until all points are regular.</p><p>The reason for repeating gradient smoothing in Step 5 is that the paths constructed in Step 4 are not guaranteed to satisfy the required error bounds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Remeshing</head><p>The geometric approximation of the graph of f requires us to determine a triangular mesh within each quadrangular patch. We discuss the construction of such meshes that are conforming (free of cracks) across shared boundaries.</p><p>Parametrization The remeshing of a quadrangular patch requires us to first construct a parametrization over a square. For this purpose, we use mean value coordinates as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[Floater 2003</ref>]. We map the four boundary curves by arc length to the four edges of the unit square. To map the interior of the patch (which at this point is represented as a portion of the triangulation K), we use the fact that each vertex can be expressed as a convex combination of its neighbors. The coefficients in this combination may be computed by solving a sparse linear system. Given the parametrization on the boundary, we use these coefficients to map the vertices to the square, thus completing the parametrization. Next, we sample the unit square on a uniform grid and use its preimage on M as a new mesh for the patch. The grid resolution is chosen based on a given error bound evaluated along boundary paths which, by construction, follow the direction of maximum change in function value. Specifically, we refine each path until it satisfies the error bound and choose the grid resolution to match the maximum resolution along the four boundary paths.</p><p>Crack-free meshes We avoid dependencies between meshes of different patches by allowing T-junctions along shared boundaries. In other words, our representation is not a global triangulation of M but rather a collection of patches, each triangulated using a regular mesh. We call the collection crack-free when the meshes agree geometrically along shared boundaries. One source of potential cracks is the different resolution of neighboring patches. We address this problem by first sampling all paths individually, and when additional samples are required, ensuring that these lie on edges of these paths. In other words, we create T-junctions without physical cracks.</p><p>There is a second source of potential cracks that is more difficult to cope with, namely the junctions created by the MS complex algorithm, which are the points at which 1-manifolds merge. As discussed in Section 3, each quadrangle has a connected interior, and we refer to the closure of this open region as a patch. Clearly, each junction is the corner of at least one patch. When displaying the data, it is important to render every junction independently of the chosen resolution for the patches. To achieve this goal, we require that each junction is a vertex of the mesh of each patch that touches it. Accordingly, we modify the parametrizations along the paths: We define a segment as the connected portion between two junctions or critical points and sample each segment independently.</p><p>Data layout and rendering Rather than storing a mesh for each quadrangle explicitly, we use regular grids. This approach allows us to use methods like the one described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[Linstrom and Pascucci 2002]</ref> for rendering purposes. By storing each grid in what Lindstrom and Pascucci called interleaved embedded quadtrees we avoid having to store connectivity information, while maintaining high flexibility during rendering. This framework can be extended easily to adaptive, view-dependent rendering, as well as efficient view frustum culling and geomorphing. One disadvantage of this data layout is a 33% memory overhead. Another important aspect is the definition of local error coefficients. As we are working with many smaller grids, rather than a single high-resolution one, we must ensure a consistent rendering across boundaries. Since we enforce that samples on grid boundaries are shared their respective error terms agree. Independently of the error term, a patch must always render all its junctions which we guarantee by setting their errors to infinity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Results</head><p>We have tested our algorithm on the Puget Sound terrain data set at resolution 1025-by-1025 and elevation values represented by twobyte unsigned integers. We also have used simulation data of the autoignition of a spatially non-homogeneous hydrogen-air mixture, courtesy of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Echekki and Chen [2003]</ref>, at resolution 512-by-512 with temperature values represented by single-byte unsigned integer values. All tests were performed on a 1.8GHz Pentium 4 Linux PC with 1Gb of main memory.</p><p>A straightforward application of our algorithm is the removal of topological noise without smoothing the data. This functionality does not dependent on the hierarchy and is implemented by repeated cancellation of critical point pairs with lowest persistence. Our experience suggests that this noise removal step should always be applied, even when one only removes the topological artifacts caused by symbolic perturbation, which can be achieved by setting the persistence threshold during noise removal to zero. The effect of this procedure is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>, where it reduces the number of critical points from 2,859 (left) to 446 (right). This reduction is achieved by removing all topological features with persistence less than 0.1% of the temperature range, which was done in about one second. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows the Puget Sound data set. The original topology has 49,185 critical points and is too dense to be printed. The upper-left picture shows the data with 4,045 critical points obtained after removing the topological noise using a persistence threshold of 0.5% of the elevation range. The upper-right picture shows the approximation of the data with 2,025 critical points obtained by increasing the persistence threshold to 1.2%. The lower-left picture shows a significantly coarser MS complex containing 289 critical points that remain after increasing the persistence threshold to 20%. Finally, the lower-right picture shows a view-dependent image of the data constructed for the purple view frustum. The resolution is preserved inside the frustum yielding a total of 1,070 critical points. Outside the frustum, we have simplified the data to the extent possible. One observes a quick drop in resolution away from the frustum. The pre-processing of the Puget Sound data was done in about three and a half hours, due to the slow convergence of the geometric fitting procedure. The traversal of the hierarchy and rendering are fully interactive. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> lists numerical measurements that quantify our two experiments. It compares the respective original data set with simplified representations obtained by varying two independent parameters: the persistence threshold that defines the layer in the multiresolution data structure and the rendering error threshold that controls the resolution of the meshes representing the geometry. The persistence threshold determines the version of the MS complex and therefore also the number of critical points, which we give in square brackets because it is perhaps a more intuitive parameter than the persistence threshold itself. For each chosen pair of parameters, we use the Metro tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Cignoni et al. 1998</ref>] to compute the root-mean-square (RMS) of the vertical error at the vertices. As expected, the RMS error grows and the total size of the meshes shrinks with increasing persistence and rendering error thresholds. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusions</head><p>We have described a new topology-based multi-resolution data structure for functions over 2-manifolds and demonstrated its use for two-dimensional height fields. The hierarchy allows one to extract geometry adaptively for a given topological error. Due to its robustness in the presence of topological noise and its well-defined simplification procedures, the approach is appealing for applications based on topological analysis, for example, data segmentation and feature detection and tracking in medical imaging or simulated flow field data sets. Future work will be concerned with fitting the complete geometry within a given error bound and the extension to volumetric datasets. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>: (Left) Original MS complex of the combustion process data with 2,859 critical points. A textured rendering is shown together with the corresponding MS complex in which maxima are red, minima are blue, saddles are green, and paths are black.
