<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The performance of a number of algorithms in graphics and visualization is known to decay with the increase of the topolog-ical complexity of the input. Examples include work on resampling and parametrization <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[Lee et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gu et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Guskov et al. 2000]</ref>, geometry compression <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[Touma and Gotsman 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gumhold and Strasser 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alliez and Desbrun 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lopes et al. 2002]</ref>, texturing <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[Sander et al. 2001</ref>] and many others. On the other hand, the standard 3D geometry reconstruction algorithms often produce 3D models that are topologically much more complex than their real forms. This is due to both inaccuracy and noise generated by the present 3D scanning devices and the insensitiveness of the reconstruction algorithms to the topological structure of the reconstructed object. The topological structure of the reconstructed object is often known a priori. In 3D scanning applications, most objects have relatively simple topological structure that can easily be observed. In other domains, the desired topological structure can also be known from observations (e.g. there is no doubt that a topologically correct reconstruction of the brain should be of genus zero). This paper introduces a simple and efficient technique allowing to extract topologically simple approximate isosurfaces of prescribed genus from volume datasets. It can either work directly with 3D acquisition methods in which the data is captured in a volumetric form (like CT or MRI) or when a volumetric model is one of the intermediate stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[Levoy et al. 2000]</ref>. It can also be used as a component in a volumetric topology simplification procedure for polygonal models in a manner similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[Norruddin and Turk 1999]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Overview of the Algorithm</head><p>Our algorithm takes as input a volume dataset with an isovalue and a nonnegative integer T specifying the desired genus of the output isosurface. The volume dataset consists of regularly spaced samples, located at nodes of an axis-oriented cubical grid. Each of the samples has a value. By a voxel we shall mean an axis-oriented cube centered at a sample, whose edges have lengths equal to the size of the grid. Clearly, there is a one-to-one correspondence be- <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Top: snapshots of the carving process (with just one resolution level) for the bonsai dataset. Bottom: the isosurface extracted using our algorithm (left, genus 0, obtained using no topology-altering voxel removals) and the largest connected component of the original isosurface (right, genus 463).</p><p>tween the samples and the voxels. Therefore, each voxel will be thought of as also having a value, equal to the value of the sample in its center. Without any loss of generality, we can assume that the isovalue is equal to zero, the samples inside the volume bounded by the isosurface are negative and the samples outside that volume are positive. We will also assume that the isosurface does not intersect the boundary of the dataset, i.e. that the boundary voxels have a positive value. This assumption can easily be enforced by adding a 'border' of width 1 consisting of voxels of a positive value around the original volume.</p><p>Volume datasets that appear in practice frequently contain a considerable amount of noise. In particular, it is common that the union of all negative voxels consists of several connected components, only one of which is significant. Therefore, we remove all such connected components except for the largest one by changing the value of their voxels to an arbitrary positive number. An alternative variant of the algorithm (treating the sum of the connected component count and the geni of all connected components of the isosurface as a measure of topological complexity and providing the user with control over this quantity for the output surface) is briefly discussed in Section 7.</p><p>We will proceed in five stages:</p><p>1. Cleanup. The largest connected component of the union of negative voxels is computed. The values of all of the negative voxels that do not belong to it are changed to an arbitrary positive number. After this operation, the union of all negative voxels is connected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Distance Function Approximation. The values of the voxels</head><p>outside the isosurface are altered so that they are close to the distance to the isosurface. This is done in a way preserving the geometry of the isosurface, i.e. so that the isosurfaces in the original and altered volumes are the same.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Topology-Sensitive</head><p>Carving. An operation that removes a boundary voxel with a positive value while preserving the topology (more precisely: homotopy type) is performed iteratively, starting from a bounding box of the isosurface that is a union of voxels. If no topology-preserving boundary voxel removal operation is possible, a topology-altering one is executed. The total number of topology-altering operations can be at most T . Thus, the procedure terminates either when all positive voxels have been removed or when no topologypreserving operation is possible and T topology-altering operations have already been executed. In Section 6 we will see that the number of topology-altering voxel removal operations practically gives the user precise control over the genus of the output isosurface. To make the boundary of the carved set close to the original isosurface (in particular, open large handles before small ones) we apply the greedy heuristic: the voxels are removed in the order of decreasing value (i.e. approximate distance to the isosurface). Snapshots of the carving process are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows isosurfaces obtained from the signed distance field of the Buddha model for T = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.</p><p>4. Volume Update. The positive voxels in the set constructed in the previous step are made negative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Isosurfacing.</head><p>A variant of the Marching Cubes algorithm that produces an isosurface bounding a volume of the same homotopy type as the union of negative voxels <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Bhaniramka et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Han et al. 2001</ref>] is applied.</p><p>Our procedure can be made considerably more efficient by adopting a multiresolution approach. After the distance function approximation stage, a pyramid representation of the volume (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Burt and Adelson 1983]</ref>) is built based on the 'minimum' filter, which computes the minimum of voxel values in a 2 × 2 × 2 block. The carving stage (without topology-altering voxel removals) of our algorithm is first performed on the lowest resolution. Then, the resolution is increased by subdividing the voxels and the carving algorithm is restarted. This process is repeated until the original resolution is reached. All the remaining stages of the algorithm, including the topology-altering voxel removal operations, are run on the original resolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Related Work</head><p>Our algorithm is related to a number of results concerning topology simplification, level set methods, reconstruction from point clouds, triangulation of implicit surfaces and the issue of computing and representing topological features in 3D data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Topology Simplification</head><p>The problem of simplifying the topology of 3D surfaces has been studied by a number of researchers. A three-dimensional holefilling algorithm very similar in spirit to ours is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Aktouf et al. 2002]</ref>. However, it is limited to binary volumes, while our approach offers sub-voxel accuracy of the output surface. We also provide a simple way of specifying the desired genus of the output and an efficient multiresolution implementation.</p><p>The algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[Wood et al. 2002]</ref> aims to achieve the same goal as ours: to simplify the topology of an isosurface by introducing small and local changes to the volume. However, in contrast to our approach, it explicitly analyzes the topology of the input isosurface based on its Reeb Graph. For each small handle, an associated non-separating loop in the isosurface is found and the values of voxels located along its spanning disk are changed so that the handle disappears. Since we do not explicitly find and annihilate non-separating loops in the isosurface, our algorithm is more efficient for highly complex datasets. For example, the bonsai dataset of resolution 256 × 256 × 256 shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> took 75 seconds to process on an 850MHz P3 machine (together with the isosurface extraction phase), while <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[Wood et al. 2002]</ref> reports the running time of 2.8 minutes for a brain dataset of resolution 125 × 255 × 255 and with an isosurface of a comparable topological complexity (on a dual P4 machine). Our algorithm is also significantly simpler.</p><p>The work <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Guskov and Wood 2001</ref>] discusses a procedure for removing topological noise (i.e. small handles) from triangulated 3D surfaces based on a principle similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[Wood et al. 2002]</ref>. First, small loops on the input surface that are not contractible are found. Then, the surface is cut along these loops and the resulting boundary loops are filled with triangulated topological disks.</p><p>An algorithm that simplifies the topology as well as the geometry of a surface by rolling a sphere over it and filling up the regions that are not accessible to it is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[El-Sana and Varshney 1997]</ref>. The method is reported to work very well with CAD models. Our approach is different in that it performs solely topological simplification, attempting to minimize the changes to geometry. In particular, our method would not fill cavities that are merely geometric features of the isosurface.</p><p>A way to incorporate both preservation and controlled simplification of topology of isosurfaces into a geometric volume simplification procedure is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[Gerstner and Pajarola 2000]</ref>. The multiresolution variant of the algorithm discussed in this paper can be viewed as a superposition of simplification (building a pyramid representation) and a topology-preserving refinement operations (supersampling and carving). However, our goal is to simplify the topology of an isosurface while attempting to preserve its geometry as faithfully as possible. It is not clear how the algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[Gerstner and Pajarola 2000]</ref> can be used for this task in an equally straightforward way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Level Set Methods</head><p>A method to ensure preservation of topology in deformable models is described in a series of papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[Han et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Han et al. 2002]</ref>. It can also be used to extract topologically simple isosurfaces, but its reliance on deformable models makes it significantly harder to code and less efficient.</p><p>The level-set-based surface reconstruction algorithm with hole filling capability described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[Zhao et al. 2001</ref>] also bears some similarities to our approach. It presents a method of reconstructing a surface from an arbitrary 3D set. It uses level set method to find a surface that is minimal with respect to an objective function defined using the distance from the input set (essentially, the L p norm of the distance restricted to the surface). The carving stage of our algorithm can be thought of as a greedy approach to a similar optimization problem: to supplement a voxel set with more voxels that are as close to it as possible in a way that reduces its topological complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Reconstruction from Point Clouds</head><p>The papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[Edelsbrunner to appear;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Giesen and John 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Giesen and Matthias 2003</ref>] restate the problem of 3D reconstruction from unorganized points using the terminology of dynamical systems. Their formulation also applies to our approach. Setting smoothness and discretization issues aside, the carving stage of our algorithm is similar to computing the global attractor of the gradient vector field defined by the distance function from the isosurface. The topologyaltering operations are, in turn, analogous to the reduction operations by pairing and cancellation as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[Giesen and John 2002]</ref>.</p><p>A volumetric approach to reconstructing triangle meshes from point clouds is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Esteve et al. 2002]</ref>. It is based on the concept of a discrete shrinking membrane, having width of one voxel, which is gradually shrunk toward the input point set. Various heuristics are used to ensure high regularity and to ensure the topology reflects the topology of the input point set. However, the discrete shrinking membrane method does not provide control over the topology of the output set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Implicit Surfaces</head><p>Our algorithm is closely related to shrinkwrapping, originally developed as a technique for polygonizing implicit surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[Overveld and Wyvill 1993]</ref>. As an initial approximation, one uses a triangulation of a sphere large enough to contain the implicit surface. The vertices of the triangulation are iteratively moved by a short distance along the gradient of the implicit function until they reach the desired isosurface. During that process, some of its edges are split to increase the approximation accuracy. The shrinkwrapping algorithm was extended to handle topology changes by carefully changing the connectivity when passing through a critical point in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Bottino et al. 1996]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Computing and Representing Topology</head><p>The papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[Pascucci and Cole-McLaughlin 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Carr et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Tarasov and Vyalyi 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">vanKreveld et al. 1997]</ref> present efficient algorithms for analyzing the topological structure of the level sets. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[Edelsbrunner et al. 2000]</ref>, the authors consider the topology simplification problem in the context of alpha shapes. We feel that the techniques introduced in these papers can help provide guaranteed control over the topology of the output surface of our scheme as well as more precisely describe its topological properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">The Basic Algorithm</head><p>In this section we describe the five basic steps of our algorithm, leaving the discussion of the multiresolution implementation for the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Cleanup</head><p>In many cases, especially for common CT scans, the union of the negative voxels in the input volume contains small connected components due to noise. Such components might also appear as sampling artifacts in distance fields. The purpose of this stage is to remove these connected components.</p><p>First, we label all the connected components and compute their sizes (in our case, the numbers of voxels, but other size measures can also be used) using the depth-first search algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Cormen et al. 1990]</ref>. Then, all values of the negative voxels which do not belong to the largest connected component are altered to arbitrary positive values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Distance Function Approximation</head><p>The distance function approximation step influences the order in which the voxels are removed in the carving phase, making it close to the ordering with respect to decreasing distance from the isosurface. This allows us to avoid the topological locks discussed in Section 7 and keeps the distance between the exact isosurface and its approximation produced by our algorithm small.</p><p>The values of the positive samples away from the isosurface are altered so that they increase together with the distance from the isosurface. In order to preserve the original geometry of the isosurface, we do not change values of the positive samples that are adjacent to a negative sample. The value of every remaining sample is changed to its distance from the closest negative sample. We chose to use the Manhattan distance rather than the Euclidean distance for efficiency (although the fast marching-based distance algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[Sethian 1999</ref>] could be used instead).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Carving</head><p>We start from a bounding box A of the output isosurface that is a union of voxels. The order in which the voxels are carved out of A is governed by a priority queue, initialized to hold all positive <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: Does the removal of the red voxel change the topology? A is the set of red and black voxels, and V is the red voxel. The set I(A;V ) is shown in blue. In the case shown on the left, the set δV \ I(A;V ) is empty (has zero connected components). Therefore, the removal of V changes the topology. In the case shown in the middle, both I(A;V ) and δV \ I(A;V ) have one connected component and therefore there is no topology change. Finally, for the configuration shown on the right, the set I(A;V ) has three connected components. Therefore, the removal of V induces a topology change. The test for topology change in step 2 is based on counting connected components of the intersection of the boundary of V (denoted by δV ) and the set A with voxel V removed (i.e. the union of all voxels in A except for V ). If both that intersection (which we denote by I(V ; A)) and its complement in δV , i.e. δV \ I(V ; A), each have exactly one connected component, the voxel removal does not change the topology (for an illustration in the 2D case, see <ref type="figure">Figure  3</ref>). Otherwise, it does. Clearly, this test can be completed in constant time. In practice, performing it offline for all possible configurations of a voxel's neighbors and storing the results in a lookup table leads to considerable savings of computational time. Since each voxel has 26 neighbors and each of them can be in two possible states (in A or not), there are 2 26 configurations. Thus, the lookup table requires 2 26 bits or 8MB of memory. Clearly, it is possible to reduce the number of configurations and therefore also the size of the lookup table by exploiting symmetry, but implementing this does not appear to be worthwhile in practice.</p><p>Our topology preservation test is closely related to the concept of a strong deformation retract. A topological space Y ⊂ X is a strong deformation retract of X if X can be deformed (collapsed) continuously into Y without moving the points of Y , i.e. if there exist a continuous family of maps (called a deformation) H t : X → X such that each H t restricted to Y is the identity, H 0 is the identity on X and the image of H 1 is equal to Y . If a voxel passes the topology preservation test, the voxel is removed, and the set of voxels right after the removal is a strong deformation retract of the set right before the removal <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 4)</ref>. In fact, the set generated by the loop (L) described at the beginning of this section is a strong deformation retract of the bounding box that it started with. The loop (L) can be viewed as a construction of the deformation of one onto the other. Since the bounding box is contractible and any strong deformation retract of a contractible set is known to be contractible, the final set is also contractible (therefore, in particular, it has no voids or handles) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Hocking and Young 1961]</ref>. A topological space X is contractible if and only if it can be continuously deformed to a point within itself, i.e. if there exists a continuous family of continuous mappings F t : X → X with t ∈ [0, 1] such that F 0 is the identity and F 1 is a constant map.</p><p>The procedure as described thus far always produces a contractible voxel set containing all the negative voxels. In order to give the user control over the topology of the output, we allow a user-prescribed number of voxel removals that do change the topology. A topology-altering voxel removal can be executed whenever the priority queue becomes empty and A still contains positive voxels. The removed voxel is chosen as the boundary voxel in A of the largest value or, equivalently, the one in A that has a positive value and failed the topology preservation test (line 2) at the earliest time during the carving phase. In particular, this choice causes large handles of the set represented by the negative voxels to be opened before the small ones (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Our implementation simply keeps all voxels that failed the test in a FIFO queue and searches it for the first voxel that has not been removed yet. After the topologyaltering voxel removal is performed, all neighbors of the removed voxel that belong to A are inserted into the priority queue and the loop (L) is restarted. The whole process is iterated until there are no positive voxels in A or until T topology-altering voxel removal operations have been performed and no topology-preserving voxel removal operation is possible.</p><p>Clearly, the total running time of the distance function approximation and carving stages is O(n log n), where n is the number of voxels in the bounding box.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Volume Update</head><p>This part of the procedure forces the signs of the voxels to be consistent with the set carved in the previous step (positive outside and negative inside). Since no negative voxels are outside A, this amounts to changing the values of all positive voxels that are inside A to negative values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Isosurface Extraction</head><p>So far our algorithms have concentrated on voxel sets, while virtually any real application requires sub-voxel accuracy in the output. The isosurfacing algorithm that is to work with our scheme needs to be able to transfer the topology from the voxel set consisting of negative voxels to the volume bounded by the isosurface. The standard algorithm introduced in the classical paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[Lorensen and Cline 1987]</ref> would not work for this task: a simple counterexample can be obtained by placing negative values at two opposite corners of a grid cube and making all the other samples positive. The volume bounded by the isosurface extracted based on the <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[Lorensen and Cline 1987]</ref> is disconnected while the voxel set defined by the negative value voxels is connected. However, for the threedimensional variant of the scheme of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Bhaniramka et al. 2000]</ref>, the isosurface turns out to be connected. In general, one can prove that its inside always has the same homotopy type (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Hocking and Young 1961]</ref> for the definitions) as the union of all negative voxels. The overall scheme of their algorithm is the same as that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[Lorensen and Cline 1987]</ref>: the vertices of the isosurface are points on the grid edges joining samples of different signs. Their locations are computed assuming that the value varies linearly over the edge. The vertices within a single grid cube are then joined by triangles using the information stored in a lookup table. The lookup table is indexed by all possible configurations of positive and negative values at the vertices of a grid cube. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Bhaniramka et al. 2000]</ref>, it is built as follows. Let H be the convex hull of the set of points consisting of all of the cube's vertices of negative value and all centers of edges joining vertices having values of different signs. All triangles of H that are not contained in the boundary of the grid cube are put into the lookup table ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 5</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Multiresolution Implementation</head><p>The idea of image pyramids <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Burt and Adelson 1983]</ref> allows us to considerably speed up our algorithm. We use subsampling to reduce the resolution of the volume after the distance function approximation stage. We use the minimum function as the subsampling filter. Thus, we group the voxels into disjoint 2 × 2 × 2 blocks and form the subsampled volume from the minimum values of voxels within each of the blocks. In particular, this means that the voxels in the lower resolution volume corresponding to blocks which have at least one negative voxel of the higher resolution volume will be negative, and therefore spared in the carving phase. The loop (L) described in Section 4.3 is then run on the subsampled volume. When it terminates, the resolution is increased by replacing each voxel with the corresponding eight voxels of the original dataset. The carving stage as described in Section 4.3 is then executed with the priority queue initialized to hold all positive boundary voxels. Finally, the volume update and isosurfacing stages are performed (on the original resolution). Clearly, the idea described above can also work for more than two levels of resolution, leading to additional speedup for large volumes. Our running time measurements show that the multiresolution implementation is an order of magnitude faster than an implementation of the basic algorithm. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows images of the voxel sets carved by our algorithm on consecutive levels of resolution for the signed distance function from the Buddha model. Let us note that the speedup may come at a price of lower quality of the output mesh in the areas where the volume has been modified. This is because the multiresolution approach distorts the ordering of the voxel removal operations by their value (approximate distance from the input isosurface). This is not an important issue when the handles to be removed are small, since the change to the original volume is confined to their small neighborhood. For large handles, the multiresolution variant produces results that appear more irregu- <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>: Volumes of increasing resolutions produced by the multiresolution algorithm for the signed distance function from the Buddha model. The last picture shows the output isosurface (genus 0). <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>: Isosurfaces obtained using our procedure. The dragon, obtained using T = 1, has genus 1 while brain and blade both have genus 0 (T = 0). <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>: A closeup of a handle in the dragon model. On the left, we show a view through the handle of the original isosurface. The other two images show a similar view of two genus zero approximate isosurfaces extracted using our method (single resolution variant in the center and multiresolution variant with 3 resolution levels on the right). lar than the single-resolution algorithm. However, the two surfaces always tend to stay close to each other. For example, the Hausdorff distance (measured using the MESH tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Aspert et al. 2002]</ref>) between genus zero reconstructions of the Dragon model obtained using the single resolution variant of our algorithm and a multiresolution variant with 3 levels is equal to about 6.5 times the length of edges of the grid, while the distance from both of the reconstructed models to the original isosurface are about three times more. For genus 1 reconstructions for the same model, the Hausdorff distance between any of the two reconstructions and the original turns out to be less than the edge length of the grid. We have observed similar results for other models. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows closeups of reconstructions obtained using single resolution and multiresolution variants of our algorithm in the area inside the largest handle of the original isosurface. If the quality of the output surface in the altered areas is of importance, one can use surface smoothing algorithms to improve the smoothness of the output isosurface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experimental Results</head><p>We have tested our algorithm for several signed distance functions from well known polygonal volumes and CT scans.</p><p>The information about the test datasets and the running time of our procedure is given in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. We do not show the dependence of the running time on the number of topology-altering voxel removals since it is a matter of only a fraction of a second for all the test cases. The current implementation is not optimized for memory usage: it requires about as much as the size of the dataset, with a small overhead for flags needed for each voxel (e.g. carved/not carved) and the priority queue. An implementation based on an octree representation would make the algorithm's memory requirements scale much better. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows examples of isosurfaces obtained using our procedure. In spite of lack of theoretical guarantee (see Section 7), for all our test datasets the genus of the output exhibits the same behavior: it is equal to the user-specified number T of topology altering 256 × 256 × 68 19 (4/4/5/1/5) Engine (CT scan) 256 × 256 × 110 32 (9/6/7/1/7) <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Running times (on an 850MHz P3 system) for the test datasets. Next to the total running time we list the running times of each of the five stages (cleanup, distance approximation, carving, update and isosurfacing). The running times of the stages do not sum to the total running time since neither of them includes time spent on setting up the volume pyramid and other minor startup tasks.</p><p>operations, until it reaches the first Betti number (i.e. the number of through-holes) of the largest connected component of the union of all negative voxels in the input volume.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Discussion</head><p>We introduced a simple and efficient algorithm for extracting topologically simple isosurfaces from regularly sampled volume data. Experiments show that our method provides the user with precise control over the genus of the extracted isosurface. Such control is particularly desirable when the true topology of the isosurface to be extracted is known a priori. In such cases, our algorithm can be used to filter out the topological noise present in the isosurface.</p><p>We have concentrated on a variant of the algorithm that can only produce a connected isosurface. Alternatively, the cleanup step can be given up. This allows one to construct isosurfaces approximating the union of all outer components of the input isosurface. In this case, the parameter T , the number of allowed topology-altering operations, provides the user control over the topological complexity of the output isosurface. The topological complexity of a (possibly disconnected) surface is computed by summing the geni of all connected components and the number of connected components.</p><p>Even though our algorithm is so well behaved in practice, it seems to have few provable properties. We can certainly guarantee that if no topology-preserving operations are performed then the output isosurface has genus zero (see Section 4.3). However, if the input isosurface is connected and has genus zero, the output isosurface does not have to be the same as the input surface. An example can be constructed using one of the well-known subsets of the 3D space that are retracts of R 3 but are not collapsible, e.g. the dunce hat <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[Zeeman 1964]</ref> or the house with two rooms <ref type="bibr">[Cohen 1970, Section I.2]</ref>, briefly described in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. Consider a house with two rooms built of small voxels. Select its contractible 'dense' subset of voxels A (i.e. such that every cube intersecting the house has a cube of A close to it). For example, A can be a maximal voxel tree of this subset of voxels. By a voxel tree we mean a set of voxels for which the graph having the voxels as its nodes and with edges joining the nodes corresponding to intersecting voxels is a tree. Let the voxel values in this set be negative and the values of all the other voxels be positive. The algorithm will start by computing the approximate distance from the negative voxels, which is roughly equal to the distance from the house itself. Therefore, during the carving stage, our algorithm will be carving the house. When the set becomes one voxel wide, the algorithm will fail to find a voxel whose removal preserves the topology and will terminate. The final set will resemble the house and will be different from the tree consisting <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>: The house with two rooms. It defines two 'rooms' R 1 and R 2 . In order to enter R i one has to walk through the corridor through the other room, starting with the 'door' E i . The house consists of the walls of the two rooms with the corridors' entrances and exits removed, the corridors' boundaries and the two rectangular walls connecting each of the corridors to the outer wall. <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>: Left: the isosurface of the original CT scan of an engine (genus 20). Right: the result of the algorithm without the distance function approximation step and T set to zero (genus 0). of negative voxels. We have not observed any topological locks as described above for any of our test datasets. The distance approximation stage plays an important role in preventing them. <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> shows that a large number of such locks of very high complexity may happen for a noisy dataset if the original volume densities are used instead of an approximate distance to prioritize voxel removal operations. For that particular example, 344 topology-altering carving operations are needed in order to obtain the original isosurface, having genus 20.</p><p>In future, we are planning to investigate ways to minimize the changes to the volume (e.g. the number of voxels whose values are altered in the volume update stage) needed to obtain an isosurface of prescribed topology. An approach that appears promising is to combine the results of our algorithm and a variation that grows the voxel set from a seed voxel inside the isosurface instead of carving it from its bounding box. The growing approach would work better for removing thin and long handles, for which it may be more natural to cut them. We are also planning to modify our algorithm so that it works for partially defined volume datasets like those considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Curless and Levoy 1996]</ref>. Even though our procedure requires volume traversal in a non memory coherent way, it is possible to implement it using an adaptive octree representation rather than a full volume pyramid as described in this paper. Therefore, we hope that it will be effective for large volume datasets as well. Finally, it would be interesting to investigate whether it is possible to produce a provably minimum change to the input volume that would lead to an isosurface of a prescribed topology.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 4 :</head><label>4</label><figDesc>A deformation retraction of the configuration of voxels shown in the middle of Figure 3 to the same configuration with the red vertex removed. voxels on the boundary of A and ordered by the voxel values.
