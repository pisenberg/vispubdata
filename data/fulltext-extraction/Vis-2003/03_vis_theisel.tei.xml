<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Topological methods have become a standard tool in visualizing 2D vector fields. After their introduction as a visualization tool in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[Helman and Hesselink 1989</ref>], a considerable amount of research has been done to extract, analyze, modify and visualize topological skeletons of 2D vector fields. A topological skeleton basically consists of critical points and certain stream lines called separatrices, which divide the flow domain into areas of different flow behavior. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[Helman and Hesselink 1989]</ref>, first order critical points are classified by an eigenvalue/eigenvector analysis of the Jacobian matrix, and separatrices starting from saddle points and from attachment and detachment points at no-slip boundaries are considered.</p><p>In the following years, these topological concepts have been generalized in several ways. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[Scheuermann et al. 1998</ref>] treat higher order critical points, i.e. critical points with a possibly vanishing Jacobian. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[Trotts et al. 2000]</ref> introduce critical points at infinity to find new separatrices. In <ref type="bibr">[de Leeuw and van Liere 1999a]</ref>, separatrices starting from boundary switch points are discussed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[Wischgoll and Scheuermann 2001]</ref> propose a method which detects closed separatrices. Topological methods are used to simplify <ref type="bibr">[de Leeuw and van Liere 1999a;</ref><ref type="bibr">de Leeuw and van Liere 1999b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Tricoche et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tricoche et al. 2001a]</ref>, smooth <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[Westermann et al. 2001]</ref>, compress <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[Lodha et al. 2000]</ref> and design <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[Theisel 2002</ref>] vector fields. Topological skeletons of 2D scalar fields (which can be considered as a special case of 2D vector fields) are treated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Edelsbrunner et al. 2001]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[Lavin et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Theisel and Weinkauf 2002]</ref>, topologybased 2D vector field metrics are defined. The topological behavior of time-dependent vector fields is analyzed in <ref type="bibr">[Tricoche et al. 2001b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Tricoche et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Theisel and Seidel 2003]</ref>. Visualizing the topological skeleton is attractive since even a complex flow behavior can be represented by a limited number of graphical primitives.</p><p>Although topological methods are well developed for 2D vector <ref type="bibr">IEEE Visualization 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, October 19-24, 2003</ref>, Seattle, Washington, USA 0-7803-8120-3/03/$17.00 ©2003 IEEE fields, only a few approaches exist for applying them to 3D vector fields. Similar to 2D vector fields, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Helman and Hesselink 1991]</ref> proposed methods for detecting and classifying first order critical points by an eigenvalue/eigenvector analysis of the Jacobian matrix. A system for visualizing the topological skeleton of 3D vector fields has been presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[Globus and Levit 1991]</ref>. Topological skeletons of particular analytic 3D vector fields are extracted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[Löffelmann et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hauser and Gröller 2000]</ref>. A critical point based metric of 3D vector fields has been presented in . All 3D topology methods mentioned above either ignore separatrices, i.e. focus only on a part of the topology, or they were applied only to vector fields with a rather simple topology, i.e. with a small number of critical points and separatrices. One reason for this seems to be that separatrices of 3D vector fields consist also of stream surfaces -a fact which creates a number of problems. In particular, we see the following reasons why topological visualization of 3D vector fields is still less common than of 2D vector fields:</p><p>• The integration of stream surfaces is computationally more involved and less stable than the integration of stream lines, since convergence and divergence effects on the stream surface may occur.</p><p>• The visualization of the topological skeleton of a vector field requires simultaneous visualization of a higher number of stream surfaces, which very soon leads to visually cluttered representations. <ref type="figure">Figure 1a</ref> and 1b depict an example. In <ref type="figure">Figure</ref> 1a, only the critical points of a 3D vector field are visualized using icons. An additional visualization of the separation surfaces as in <ref type="figure">Figure 1b</ref> creates visual clutter, since the surfaces hide each other as well as the critical points. This problem remains, even if the separation surfaces are rendered in a semi-transparent mode.</p><p>A number of solutions have been proposed for the first problem, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[Hultquist 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gelder 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Scheuermann et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">van Wijk 1993]</ref>. In this paper, we tackle the second problem. In order to create sparse visual representations that avoid occlusion and minimize visual clutter, we propose to represent the separation surfaces as a finite number of stream lines. These stream lines are the intersection curves of the separation surfaces. We call them saddle connectors because they start and end in saddle points of the vector field.</p><p>The saddle connectors indicate only the approximate run of the separation surfaces and of course cannot completely substitute them. A possible procedure is to always depict the saddle connectors and interactively, on user demand, additionally display single separating surfaces.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 restates the basic concepts of 3D vector field topology. Section 3 introduces the concept of saddle connectors and discusses their computation and visual representation. Section 4 shows the results of applying saddle connectors to 3D vector fields of a complex topology. Section 5 draws conclusions and mentions future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Topology of a 3D Vector Field</head><p>Topological structures of 3D vector fields are well-understood in the visualization community for many years <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Helman and Hesselink 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Asimov 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chong et al. 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Philippou and Strickland 1997]</ref>. In this section, we collect the most important concepts and properties. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Critical points</head><p>Given a 3D vector field v : IE 3 → IR 3 , a first order critical point x0 (i.e., a point x0 with v(x0) = 0 and det(Jv(x0)) = 0, where Jv(x) = ∇v(x) is the Jacobian matrix of v) can be classified by an eigenvalue/eigenvector analysis of Jv(x0). Let λ1, λ2, λ3 be the eigenvalues of Jv(x0) ordered according to their real parts, i.e. Re(λ1) ≤ Re(λ2) ≤ Re(λ3). Furthermore, let e1, e2, e3 be the corresponding eigenvectors, and let f1, f2, f3 be the eigenvectors of the transposed Jacobian (Jv(x0)) T corresponding to λ1, λ2, λ3. (Note that J and J T have the same eigenvalues but not necessarily the same eigenvectors.) Concerning the real parts of the eigenvalues, the following classification of critical points is possible:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">• sources: 0 &lt; Re(λ1) ≤ Re(λ2) ≤ Re(λ3) • repelling saddles: Re(λ1) &lt; 0 &lt; Re(λ2) ≤ Re(λ3) • attracting saddles: Re(λ1) ≤ Re(λ2) &lt; 0 &lt; Re(λ3) • sinks: Re(λ1) ≤ Re(λ2) ≤ Re(λ3) &lt; 0</formula><p>Each of these classes can be further divided into two stable 1 subclasses by deciding if imaginary parts in the eigenvalues are present. Since vector fields usually consist of a finite number of critical points, an iconic representation is the appropriate visualization approach. Several icons have been proposed in the literature, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Helman and Hesselink 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Globus and Levit 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Löffelmann et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hauser and Gröller 2000]</ref>. In the following we describe the different classes of critical points as well as the icons we used for their visual representation. We colored these icons depending on the flow behavior: Attracting parts (inflow) are colored blue, while repelling parts (outflow) are colored red.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sources and Sinks</head><p>A source xSo is characterized by the fact that in its neighborhood all stream lines diverge from xSo. The two stable subclasses are repelling nodes and repelling foci.</p><p>A repelling node is characterized by the absence of imaginary parts in λ1, λ2, λ3, and e1, e2, e3 are linearly independent ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  2a</ref>). To visualize a repelling node, we use a red ellipsoid with a shape determined by the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Jacobian ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2b)</ref>.</p><p>A repelling focus is characterized by the presence of two eigenvalues with imaginary parts, say λ2, λ3. In this case, the only real eigenvector e1 of J describes the direction of straight outflow. In addition, there is a plane in which a 2D repelling focus behavior appears. This plane is perpendicular to the only real eigenvector f1 of J T <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 2c</ref>). As an icon, we used a red double cone representing the outflow plane and the outflow direction by its shape <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 2d</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repelling Saddles and Attracting Saddles</head><p>A repelling saddle xR has one direction of inflow behavior (called inflow direction) and a plane in which a 2D outflow behavior occurs (called outflow plane through xR). For all other directions around xR, the stream lines do not touch xR. The two stable subclasses are repelling node saddles and repelling focus saddles.</p><p>A repelling node saddle has no imaginary parts in λ1, λ2, λ3, and e1, e2, e3 are linearly independent ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3a</ref>). Its icon includes a red ellipse denoting the outflow plane defined by e2, e3 and λ2, λ3, while a blue arrow pointing to the center of the ellipse represents the inflow direction ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3b)</ref>.</p><p>A repelling focus saddle is characterized by Im(λ2) = −Im(λ3) = 0. Here, the only real eigenvector e1 of J describes the inflow direction. The only real eigenvector f1 of J T describes the plane with the 2D repelling focus behavior <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figures 3c-d</ref>).</p><p>An attracting saddle xA can be interpreted as an inverse version of a repelling saddle. It has one direction of outflow behavior (outflow direction) and a plane in which a 2D inflow behavior appears (inflow plane through xA). The two stable subclasses are attracting node saddles without imaginary parts of the eigenvalues (Figures 3e-f) and attracting focus saddles <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figures 3g-h</ref>).</p><p>In addition to the kinds of critical points described above, a number of unstable versions of sources, sinks and repelling/attracting saddles exist. Also, two further classes of unstable critical points exist which do not belong to any of the above-mentioned classes: attracting centers and repelling centers. A repelling center is characterized by Re(λ1) = Re(λ2) = 0 &lt; Re(λ3) and Im(λ1) = −Im(λ2) = 0. It consists of one direction e3 of outflow behavior and one plane perpendicular to f3 with a 2D circulating behavior. An attracting center has Re(λ1) &lt; 0 = Re(λ2) = Re(λ3) and Im(λ2) = −Im(λ3) = 0. The inflow direction is defined by e1 and the 2D circulating behavior can be found in the plane perpendicular to f1.</p><p>Higher order critical points are not considered in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Separatrices</head><p>Separatrices are curves or surfaces which separate regions of different flow behavior. Since around sources and sinks a homogeneous flow behavior is present (either a complete outflow or inflow),  sources and sinks do not contribute to separatrices. A repelling saddle xR creates two separatrices: one separation curve (which is a stream line starting in xR in the inflow direction by backward integration) and a separation surface (which is a stream surface starting in the outflow plane by forward integration). <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> gives an illustration. A similar statement holds for attracting saddles. Further kinds of separatrices are possible, for instance separation surfaces emanating from boundary switch curves, or closed stream lines. However, in this paper we restrict ourselves to separatrices starting from saddle points.</p><p>As already shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1b</ref>, the complete visualization of a rather complex topological skeleton does not give visually pleasing results. Because of this, we propose an alternative approach as described in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Saddle Connectors</head><p>This section introduces the new concept of saddle connectors and discusses properties and computational attempts. The basic idea of saddle connectors is to consider the intersection of the separation surfaces of two saddle points. For this intersection, the following cases are possible:</p><p>• The separation surfaces of two saddles have no intersection <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 5a</ref>).</p><p>• The separation surfaces have one intersection curve ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure  6a</ref>).</p><p>• The separation surfaces have more than one, but a finite number of intersection curves <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 5b</ref>).</p><p>• The separation surfaces partially collapse. In this case, the intersection of the separation surfaces is a surface <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 5c</ref>).</p><p>We define saddle connectors as follows ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref> gives an illustration):</p><p>Definition 1 Let v be a 3D vector field, and let x1 and x2 be two saddle points in v. We consider the intersection of the two separation surfaces starting in the outflow/inflow planes of x1 and x2. If this intersection is a curve, we call it a saddle connector.  Note that this definition excludes cases of partially collapsing separation surfaces. This is justified by the fact that this case can be seen as an unstable situation in the vector field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Properties of Saddle Connectors</head><p>An intersection of the separating surfaces of two saddle points can only exist if one of the saddles is an attracting saddle and the other one is a repelling saddle. To see this, imagine for instance two attracting saddles 2 xA 1 , xA 2 , and suppose that a certain point p lies on both separation surfaces of xA 1 and xA 2 . Then the stream line starting from p in forward direction must both pass through xA 1 and xA 2 , which contradicts to basic properties of critical points and stream lines.</p><p>Also from definition 1 we obtain that a saddle connector is a stream line which starts in the outflow plane of a repelling saddle xR and ends in the inflow plane of an attracting saddle xA. This holds because for every stream surface, the stream line starting from any point on this surface lies completely in the stream surface. Thus, if a point p lies on both separation surfaces of xR and xA, the whole stream line starting in p in forward and backward direction lies in both separation surfaces. Therefore, this stream line connects both saddles.</p><p>One way of analyzing separation surfaces is asking for their boundary curves. If a separation surface does not have a strong diverging behavior, its boundary curve gives a good deal of information about its behavior in the 3D domain of v. The boundary curve of a separation surface may be a closed curve on the boundary of the domain of v. It is also possible that the separation surface ends in a number of sinks or sources. In this case, there is a relation between the saddle connectors and the boundary curves of the separation surfaces. To compute the boundary curve of the separation surface of a repelling saddle xR, we can compute the saddle connectors of xR with all attracting saddles. Then we consider the repelling separation curves of all attracting saddles which share a saddle connector with xR. If the union of all these curves forms a closed curve, this closed curve describes the boundary curve of the separation surface of xR. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref> shows an example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Seeding and Integrating the Separation Surfaces</head><p>Since saddle connectors are intersections of separation surfaces their integration process will play a substantial role in the computation of the connectors. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Si-1 Si</head><p>Ri-1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Si Si+1</head><p>Ri Si <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>: Computing time ribbons of a separation surface; (a) the time line Si−1 consists of the red points and edges, the time line Si is colored green; the time ribbon Ri−1 is described by the triangulation between Si−1 and Si (gray area); (b) to compute the time ribbon Ri, we apply one numerical integration step to each point of Si and adaptively insert/remove points; this way we obtain Si+1 (blue points); (c) the new time ribbon Ri is the triangulation between Si and Si+1 (gray area).</p><p>To integrate the separation surface of a saddle point x0, we place n0 points in an equidistant manner on a small circle in the outflow/inflow plane around x0. They serve as the seeding points of the separation surface. This closed polygon S0 = (s0,0, ..., sn 0 ,0) can be considered as the time line of the separation surface for the time t0.</p><p>This kind of seeding yields good results for most topologies except for focus saddles with strong circulation, where the stream lines would intersect the seeding circle. In this case we place the seeding points on a small line in the outflow/inflow plane starting at the critical point.</p><p>The integration of the separation surfaces is done using a technique similar to the one proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[Hultquist 1992]</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Stalling 1998</ref>]. To get the time line Si+1, we apply one step of a numerical stream line integration 3 to all points of Si = <ref type="figure">(s0,i, ..., sn i ,i)</ref>. To the ni new points obtained this way, an adaptive thinning or enrichment is applied similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Stalling 1998</ref>]. This results in a new number of points for <ref type="figure">Si+1 = (s0,i+1, ..., sn i+1 ,i+1)</ref>. By applying a triangulation between Si and Si+1, we obtain a time ribbon Ri. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> gives an illustration.</p><p>For each stream line a parameter α is stored, which determines its starting point on the seeding rake 4 . Consider two neighboring points s k,i and s k+1,i with their corresponding parameters α k and α k+1 . For every α ∈ (α k , α k+1 ), the integration of the stream line from the seeding rake gives -after i time steps -a new point between s k,i and s k+1,i . This way of constructing a new point on the time line Si is used both for the adaptive enrichment described above and for the refinement step in the algorithm described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Computing the Saddle Connector Between two Saddles</head><p>Several approaches for finding saddle connectors can be thought of. We want to discuss two of them here. The first approach follows directly the definition of saddle connectors by integrating the separation surfaces and intersecting their triangle mesh representations.</p><p>To ensure that the resulting intersection curves start and end near the saddles, each surface needs to be integrated until it comes very close to all other saddles that share a connector with the originating saddle. Only in this case, the resulting intersection curves start and end near the critical points. Our experience has shown that especially for topologies with circulating flow behavior like focus saddles, this is hard to ensure. Furthermore, this approach does not only need a lot of integration steps but also a considerable amount of memory as one needs to hold all generated triangles.</p><p>We propose another algorithm with less memory consumption, which enables us to find saddle connectors with less integration steps than the first approach. We utilize the fact that saddle connectors are particular stream lines: knowing one (non-critical) point of a stream line is enough to integrate the whole line. Unfortunately, the only prior known points of a saddle connector are its connected saddles. Both are critical points and do not suffice to uniquely determine the stream line.</p><p>Consider a repelling saddle xR and an attracting saddle xA. As their separating surfaces start at the seeding rakes, the starting and ending points of the saddle connector lie on the rakes as well. We apply a simultaneous integration of the stream surfaces until an intersection point p is found. This point lies close to the saddle connector, but due to the triangle approximation of the surfaces it is not necessarily on the connector itself. Let p be the point on the connector which is closest to p. p has two corresponding seeding points -one on each rake. They can be described by the parameters α ∈ (α k , α k+1 ) and β ∈ (β h , β h+1 ) and are found by applying a refinement.</p><p>To find p we only need to simultaneously compute the time ribbons R R i of xR and R A i of xA, and check them for intersection. For this it is sufficient to check if the last time line of xR intersects the last time ribbon of xA and vice versa. This means that we do not have to check the triangular strips themselves for intersection, but line segments with triangular strips. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref> illustrates the process of finding a saddle connector and algorithm 1 gives a detailed description.</p><p>For two reasons this algorithm may find more than one intersection point. First, the considered saddles may have multiple connectors (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5b)</ref>. Second, we perform two intersection tests after each surface propagation, and in many cases 5 both produce results at the same time step. The two points resulting from this are very close to each other, and one of them can be deleted safely. The algorithm terminates after finding a certain maximal number of intersection points (or if a maximal time is reached).</p><p>Algorithm 1 depends on a number of parameters: the step size of the stream line integration, the number of initial seed points, and the thresholds for inserting or deleting points for a new time line. For all these values, a reasonable compromise has to be found between performance and accuracy.</p><p>An advantage of algorithm 1 is that it avoids stream line integration in numerically complicated regions (i.e., in regions in which the separation surface of a saddle comes close to another saddle and therefore has a strongly diverging behavior). Also, the algorithm <ref type="bibr">5</ref> But not in all cases: If we use different step sizes for the integration of the surfaces, these two tests may result in only one intersection point. Thats why two tests are performed. Otherwise one time ribbon could "jump" over the other.  Algorithm 1 Finding intersections between separation surfaces</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p[ ] = EmptyArrayOfPoints() S A 0 = Seed(xA) S R 0 = Seed(xR) S A 1 = PropagateSurface (xA, S A 0 , t1) R A 0 = Triangulate (S A 1 , S A 0 ) i = 0 while (Size (p[ ]) &lt; nmax) ∧ (ti &lt; tmax) do S R i+1 = PropagateSurface (xR, S R i , ti+1) R R i = Triangulate (S R i+1 , S R i ) p[ ]+ = GetIntersectionPoints (S R i+1 , R A i ) p[ ]+ = GetIntersectionPoints (S A i+1 , R R i ) S A i+2 = PropagateSurface (xA, S A i+1 , ti+2) R A i+1 = Triangulate (S A i+2 , S A i+1 ) p[ ]+ = GetIntersectionPoints (S R i+1 , R A i+1 ) p[ ]+ = GetIntersectionPoints (S A i+2 , R R i ) FreeMemory (S R i , R R i , S A i+1 , R A i ) i = i + 1 end while</formula><p>stops after a certain pre-defined number nmax of maximal connectors is found 6 . This leads to a significant reduction of necessary integration steps. Finally, note that memory is hardly a problem, since from each separation surface only a time ribbon (represented by a triangular strip) is stored at any stage of the algorithm.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Computing all Saddle Connectors</head><p>To catch the topology of the whole 3D vector field, we have to compute the saddle connectors between all saddle points. A naive approach to do so -applying the algorithm of section 3.3 to any pair of repelling and attracting saddles -is not an appropriate solution because the time-consuming integration of a separation surface is repeated again and again. Instead, we avoid a multiple computation of a separation surface by grouping all attracting and all repelling saddles and applying a slightly modified version of algorithm 1 on these two groups: after computing a new time ribbon for all saddles in one group, they have to be checked against all current time ribbons of the other group.</p><p>If a time ribbon of a saddle leaves the domain of the vector field or collapses to a number of single points, the time ribbon is excluded from further consideration. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n 2 ) where n is the number of saddle points in the vector field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Visual Representation of Saddle Connectors</head><p>Once saddle connectors are computed, we have to find a graphical representation. The simplest way is to use a line representation similar to stream lines. However, since saddle connectors are defined as the intersection of two separation surfaces, we can also visualize the orientation of the separation surfaces in the neighborhood of the saddle connector. To do so, we use a double flow ribbon approach as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 10b</ref>.</p><p>Given are the repelling saddle xR, the attracting saddle xA and their saddle connector represented by a sequence c0, ..., cm of points. To construct the flow ribbon belonging to the separation surface of xA, we have to find a sequence p0, ..., pm of points in such a way that the distance between ci and pi is constant, and the line segments (ci, pi) are in the separation surface of xA for all i. To do so, we set p0 = xR + λ • e where e is the only eigenvector of Jv(xR) which has a negative eigenvalue, and λ is chosen in such a way that c0 and p0 have a pre-defined constant distance. Then the point pi+1 is constructed from ci, ci+1 and pi by the following conditions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">• (pi+1 − ci+1) ⊥ (ci+1 − ci) • det(pi − ci , v(pi) , pi+1 − ci+1) = 0, i.e., (pi+1 − ci+1)</formula><p>lies in the plane given by the 3 points ci, pi, pi + v(pi).</p><p>• pi+1 − ci+1 = pi − ci <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 10a</ref> gives an illustration. In a similar way we compute the flow ribbon which belongs to the separation surface of xR.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Applications</head><p>We applied the concept of saddle connectors to two 3D data sets of a rather complex topology. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 11 -12</ref> visualize a snapshot of a transitional wake behind a circular cylinder <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[Zhang et al. 1995]</ref>. This flow exhibits periodic vortex shedding leading to the well known von Kármán vortex street. This phenomenon plays an important role in many industrial applications, like mixing in heat exchangers or mass flow measurements with vortex counters. However, this vortex shedding can lead to undesirable periodic forces on obstacles, like chimneys, buildings, bridges and submarine towers.</p><p>This data set was derived from a direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equation by Gerd Mutschke <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[Mutschke 2003</ref>]. The data resolves the so-called 'mode A' of the 3D transition at a Reynolds number of 200 and at a spanwise wavelength of 4 diameters. The figures display a small near-wake region of a large computational domain. All 13 fixed points are contained in the shown domain and span the topological skeleton of the incompressible velocity field.</p><p>The topology enables to reduce a high-dimensional data set to a simple conceptual flow representation from which qualitative conclusions can be drawn. Using saddle connectors, the skeleton elucidates the symmetry of the mode A with respect to a plane which is perpendicular to the cylinder axis. The spanwise and transverse connectedness of the distributed saddle points of a single snapshot already indicates the experimentally observed good mixing properties of vortex shedding. The saddle points, for instance, are regions of enhanced stretching. Our algorithm detects and visualizes 9 saddle connectors in the data set. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Figures 1 and 14</ref> visualize the electrostatic field around a ben-  zene molecule. This data set was calculated on a 101 3 regular grid using the fractional charges method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[Stalling and Steinke 1996]</ref>. It consists of 184 first order critical points. The saddle connector visualizations show 129 connectors between 78 attracting and 43 repelling saddles. This example shows that saddle connectors give expressive visualizations even for topologically complex 3D vector fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>We have introduced the concept of saddle connectors as a new approach to visualizing the topological skeleton of complex 3D vector fields. Although the theory of topological skeletons of 3D vector fields is well understood in the visualization community, expressive visualizations have only been obtained for topologically simple data sets (or by a restriction to only a part of the topology). Saddle connectors yield for the first time expressive visualizations of complex topological skeletons with a higher number of critical points and separatrices. Saddle connectors can be interpreted as a "skeleton of a skeleton" concept. In fact, a geometrically simplified representation is computed for the system of separation surfaces. Although we have shown that this is a useful compromise between the amount of coded information and the expressiveness of the visualization for complex topological skeletons, one important property of the topological skeleton is lost: the unique partition of the vector field into areas of similar flow behavior. In fact, using saddle connectors it is no longer possible to uniquely infer the flow behavior of v from any point of the domain. Nevertheless, due to the usage of a double flow ribbon representation of the saddle connectors, the user can comprehend the topology of the 3D vector field as well as the flow behavior in particular points of the domain. Furthermore, with the possibility to interactively demand the display of single separation surfaces, the user can explore the partitioning of the whole domain.</p><p>In future work we will reduce the number of parameters for steering the computation of saddle connectors in our current implementation. Furthermore, we plan to combine the concept of saddle connectors with alternative stream surface integration methods (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[Scheuermann et al. 2001]</ref>), if a higher accuracy is necessary in certain regions of the vector field.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Sources and sinks; (a) repelling node and (b) its icon; (c) repelling focus and (d) its icon; (e) attracting node and (f) its icon; (g) attracting focus and (h) its icon.</figDesc></figure>
