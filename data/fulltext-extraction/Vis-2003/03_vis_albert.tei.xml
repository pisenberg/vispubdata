			<abstract>
				<p>A new method was developed to increase the saliency of changing variables in a cardiovascular visualization for use by anesthesiologists in the operating room (OR). Clinically meaningful changes in patient physiology were identified and then mapped to the inherent psychophysical properties of the visualization. A long history of psychophysical research has provided an understanding of the parameters within which the human information processing system is able to detect changes in the size, shape and color of visual objects [Gescheider 1976; Spence 1990; Baird 1970]. These detection thresholds are known as just noticeable differences (JNDs) which characterize the amount of change in an object&apos;s attribute that is recognizable 50% of the time. A prototype version of the display has been demonstrated to facilitate anesthesiologist&apos;s performance while reducing cognitive workload during simulated cardiac events [Agutter et al. 2002]. In order to further improve the utility of the new cardiovascular visualization, the clinically relevant changes in cardiovascular variables are mapped to noticeable perceptual changes in the representational elements of the display. The results of the method described in this paper are used to merge information from the psychophysical properties of the cardiovascular visualization, with clinically relevant changes in the patient&apos;s cardiovascular physiology as measured by the clinical meaningfulness questionnaire. The result of this combination will create a visualization that is sensitive to changes in the cardiovascular health of the patient and communicates this information to the user in a meaningful, salient and intuitive manner.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Our multi-disciplinary research group has developed a cardiovascular visualization to improve situational awareness in the OR <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Zhang et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Agutter et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Drews et al. 2002]</ref>. We have now developed a method to optimize the graphic display (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) for a given set of display area constraints encountered in clinical implementation. In order to integrate the visualization into existing display technologies, the visual representation needed to be scaled such that the maximum size of any individual element could not exceed 140 pixels in height. To optimize the utility of the cardiovascular visualization, clinically meaningful changes in the patient's physiology needed to be mapped to visually salient changes in the graphic elements. The prototype of the visualization used a linear mapping of variable changes such that in the case of central venous pressure (CVP), a change of one mmHg corresponded to a change in the height of the visual element by 1 pixel. This linear mapping of variable change reflects absolute change in underlying physiology and not clinically important change in physiology. The result of the linear mapping was a suboptimal visualization that graphically indicated changes that may not have been clinically meaningful. IEEE <ref type="bibr">Visualization 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, October 19-24, 2003</ref>, Seattle, Washington, USA 0-7803-8120-3/03/$17.00 Â©2003 IEEE</p><p>The cardiovascular visualization provides graphic information in near real time about the following variables: central venous pressure (CVP), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac index (CI), S-T segment depression of the ECG waveform (ST), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), blood oxygen saturation (SaO2), heart rate (HR), and cardiac index (CI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Agutter et al. 2002]</ref>. In step with recent cognitive research, patient vital sign information is presented both graphically and numerically to facilitate situational awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[Vicente et al. 1995]</ref>. Graphically the elements of the object change in size at an appropriate rate in near real time. This visualization of the cardiovascular system represents a departure from traditional single sensor single indicator displays <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[Goodstein 1981</ref>] currently in use (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  2</ref>) by combining the available patient information into a visualization of the cardiovascular system.</p><p>This new visualization is anatomically consistent and identifies cardiovascular indices (i.e., ST segment depression) that deviate from normal in a manner that is quickly and easily identified.</p><p>During surgery, the workload for an anesthesiologist is quite demanding. The clinician often needs to divide his/her attention amongst a variety of tasks related to maintaining the patient's physiology within a healthy range. When a critical event begins to emerge, it is imperative that the anesthesiologist becomes aware of changes in the patients physiology that are contributing to the developing threat. In order to adequately maintain the patient's health, the anesthesiologist must be able to detect important changes in physiological indicators, diagnose underlying etiology, and provide appropriate treatment.</p><p>Monitors that present vital physiological information inefficiently further contribute to the anesthesiologist's task load since the clinician is faced with the challenge of further dividing cognitive resources to determine which patient variables are in a normal state and which are not <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[Vicente et al. 1995]</ref>. One advantage of the new display is its ability to orient the clinician's attention to potentially harmful physiologic variables by increasing the saliency of clinically relevant changes as they deviate from a normal range. When the patient's physiology is within the normal range, the visual cardiovascular visualization appears symmetrical and balanced (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). When variables deviate from the normal range the symmetry of the display becomes distorted and orients the user's attention to the physiologic variable(s) that are out of balance (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>). Given the symmetrical nature of the visualization when in a normal state, the saliency of the graphic representation is increased since any deviant variable essentially "pops out" of the display and facilitates recognition for the clinician <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[Triesman, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Wang et. al. 1994]</ref>. In order to capitalize on this "pop out" effect, graphic changes in the visualization must be appropriately scaled to the functional limits of the human visual perceptual system with respect to clinically meaningful changes of a given variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[Travis, 1990]</ref>.</p><p>Two critical types of information are necessary in order to effectively scale the visual information available on the new display, deviations from normal values in each variable that are clinically meaningful and the perceptual qualities of each of the elements of the visualization. The integration of these two pieces of information should result in a display that presents clinically meaningful changes in the patient's physiology that are presented in a salient and intuitive manner. It is challenging to define clinically meaningful changes for a given physiologic variable. For example if a patient's heart rate changes by 10 beats per minute this might be meaningful if that change is between 55 beats per minute and 45 beats per minute. However this change may be less significant if the heart rate changes from 140 beats per minute to 150 beats per minute.</p><p>Often experts disagree what a normal range or a significant change for a variable may be. An additional complicating factor is the rate of change in the variable. For example an increasing rate of change in heart rate of 5 beats per hour is not as meaningful as a change of 5 beats per minute. Fortunately some of this ambiguity is addressed within the design of the visualization. The symmetry of the new display when the underlying physiology is normal lends itself to quick identification of elements that deviate from a normal range. As a result the design of the visualization best reflects physiologic variables that deviate from a normal, healthy range. Given the potent perceptual properties of the visualization it is imperative that the elements do not change until a given physiologic variable deviates from the normal range for that variable.</p><p>Identifying the psychophysical properties of the display is a little more straightforward. A long history of research into the parameters of the human visual perception has identified many experimental methods aimed at determining the amount of change in an object that is necessary to be detected by a human observer <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Baird 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Manning &amp; Rosenstock 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anderson 1970]</ref>. The psychophysical properties of an object can be described in terms of just noticeable differences (JNDs) and tend to be stable across observers since the perceptual properties of a stimulus are derived from its physical characteristics. A JND is simply the amount of change in an object's size, shape, color or brightness that is recognizable 50% of the time.</p><p>The current study was designed to implement an efficient method of identifying the psychophysical properties of elemental changes in the cardiovascular visualization and scale these changes according to clinical relevance. In an effort to maximize the recognition of element changes a more conservative detection threshold relative to the JND was established for the element mapping. By applying a more conservative element mapping to clinically relevant changes in the individual elements of the cardiovascular display, the user should recognize changes in the visual elements 100% of the time thus increasing the utility of the display as well as user performance. In order to achieve this integration, data was collected from a clinically meaningfulness questionnaire and also from a psychophysical analysis of the visualization.</p><p>The goal of this study is to employ a new method for identifying and mapping salient changes of the individual elements of the visualization to clinically meaningful changes in the patient's physiology. By integrating these two types of information, clinicians will expect the visualization to change shape only when clinically meaningful changes in physiology are detected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Assessing Clinically Meaningful Changes</head><p>Eight practicing anesthesiologists with more than five years of experience in anesthesiology were asked to complete the clinical meaningfulness questionnaire. The questionnaire was designed to elicit clinically relevant changes in cardiovascular variables as they deviate from a normal range. The questionnaire asked participants to indicate the normal range, highest relevant value, lowest relevant value, significant change from normal (requiring intervention) and their overall confidence for each rating of the following variables: CVP, MPAP, PVR, MPAP, PCWP, CI, MAP, SVR, and SaO2. Subjects returning the questionnaire were compensated $50.00 for their time. Additional information about the normal range for cardiovascular physiology was gathered from the Handbook of Anesthesiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Ezekiel 1997</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Psychophysical Analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Participants</head><p>Two undergraduate students from the University of Utah were tested individually for a total of six hours each. Both participants were right handed, had normal vision, and received a perfect score on the Ishihara color blindness test <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[Ishihara 1993</ref>]. Participants were compensated $10.00/hr and were awarded a bonus of $20.00 when they completed the experiment within 3 days of beginning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Stimuli and apparatus</head><p>Two networked IBM compatible computers were used to present stimuli and collect data. Stimuli were presented on two identical 17 inch computer monitors arranged side by side and viewed at a distance of 30 inches. The visual display on each monitor presented an image of the cardiovascular visualization centered on a white background that subtended 10 degrees of visual angle. The monitor on the left presented an image of the cardiovascular visualization that served as a template and could not be adjusted (i.e., <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). The monitor on the right presented an image of the cardiovascular visualization that served as a match and could be modified by the participant (i.e., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>). Subjects were able to adjust the size of six elements of the visualization by controlling the number of pixels in each element using a modified keyboard. The computer recorded the number of pixel and hue adjustments each subject made on a given trial for each of the six elements of the visualization. In addition, for each trial, the computer recorded the total pixel values for the template visualization and the match visualization for each element in each display as well as the time between trials. To account for potential anticipatory effects the trials were presented in a random order to avoid sequential and incremental changes in the template visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Design and Data Reduction</head><p>The experiment uses a modified version of the psychophysical method of paired comparisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Manning &amp; Rosenstock 1968</ref>] to determine the JNDs for each element of the visualization. This approach provided an efficient means for calculating JNDs known as the method of average error (MAE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Fechtner 1860]</ref>, as well as a simple task for the participant to perform. The method also allowed the participant to make adjustments from above and below the template value based on appearance.</p><p>The scope of the psychophysical scaling data was constrained to the following six elements of the cardiovascular visualization: CVP, MPAP, ST segment depression, CI, MAP and SaO2. The pixel range for each element was determined by two factors. The first factor was the type of information conveyed by the element, either discrete (i.e., ST segment assigned high, medium or low values) or continuous (i.e., CVP, MPAP, CI, SaO2 and MAP). The second factor was the available inclusive pixel range for the height of each element. For example in the case of CVP, MPAP and MAP the pixel height ranges between 4 and 140 with 70 pixels appearing as normal (i.e., <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). The pixel range for continuous variables was further divided into equally distributed segments across the element's total range. Each segment with one exception contained 17 pixels. The exception was the segment between 70 and 72 pixels. This range was only 2 pixels and was employed to identify the JNDs around the normal range with a greater degree of fidelity compared to other segments. By testing one value from each segment range the number of comparisons within each element was greatly reduced (i.e., in the case of CVP, MPAP and MAP from 137 to 9).</p><p>The ability of a change in one element of the visualization to influence the perception of another element is known as a proximity effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Carswell, 1988]</ref>. Given the proximity of each element in the visualization it was necessary to assess the psychophysical properties of elements changing in isolation as well as in concert with adjacent elements. The likelihood of change in one element affecting the perception of an adjacent element is most likely in the case of the CVP and MPAP elements. Additional proximity effects were likely to be observed in the ST segment depression and the CI elements (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4)</ref>. The visualization is configured such that the ST segment depression information is conveyed within the information space determined by the CI variable. As the CI element decreases in size the perceptual saliency of the ST segment depression element likewise decreases. As a result of this interaction it was determined to establish a baseline minimum of 21 pixels for the CI element to maintain the perceptual saliency of the ST segment depression element.</p><p>Special consideration was given to the SaO2 element since this information is conveyed as a linear color change in the elements appearing after the MPAP element from left to right. This color change ranges in hue from blue to red and is meant to convey the oxygenation of the blood as it passes through the lungs (See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5)</ref>. The SaO2 element is the only element in the visualization that uses color to indicate the amount of change in a variable, but never-the-less may affect the perceptual qualities of other elements.</p><p>In order to determine the psychophysical properties of the visualization within the above parameters, 306 individual template patterns were constructed. Each subject performed a match for each template pattern 3 times for a total of 6 observations for each template. The number of segments and the pixel range for each segment of each element, as well as which elements were tested for proximity effects are shown below in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. The CVP, MPAP and MAP variables are continuous and share the same element parameters. The CI variable is also continuous but has one less segment than the other continuous variables. ST segment is discrete and assigned a normal, mild, moderate and severe appearance. Finally the SaO2 variable is continuous but mapped to a linear change in hue.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.5">Procedure</head><p>Participants used the modified keyboard to change the match display until the visualization appeared the same as the template display. They were shown how to change each of the six elements in both directions. On each trial participants adjusted the size of each element of the cardiovascular visualization presented on the right monitor so that it looked like or matched the cardiovascular visualization on the left monitor. Subjects were able to adjust the size of the individual elements using the modified keyboard. When the participant was content with the changes in the match display they pressed the return key and continued on to the next trial. Each participant performed three blocks of 306 trials. Subjects were not informed what the individual elements represented until after the study was completed. Both subjects completed the study within 3 days. At the end of the last trial subjects were debriefed, thanked and compensated.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Clinically meaningful changes</head><p>The results from the clinical meaningfulness questionnaire are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>. The information shows the measures of central tendency for each variable in terms of the clinically significant change of the variable, normal range, highest and lowest values that need to be displayed. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> summarizes the results of the psychophysical scaling study. The data are presented in pixels and indicate the average JNDs in pixels of the element changes across the entire variable range. Deviations in the number of pixels from the match display to the template display for each element were averaged to compute the JNDs (i.e., <ref type="bibr">Bardin et al. 1980)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> presents an example of the deviation data for each segment in the range of the CVP element.   In an effort to assess the perceptual affects of proximity on each of the display elements, regression analyses were performed using SPSS in order to identify which elements significantly interacted with the perceptual saliency of another given element. Subsequent analyses indicated that deviation scores for the CVP, MPAP and ST segment element coefficients were significantly affected by adjacent elements. In the case of the CVP element, changes in the CVP element affected the perception of the MPAP element; t (5) = 2.064. p &lt; .039. Similarly changes in the MPAP element affected the perception of the CVP element; t (5) = 5.989. p &lt; .001.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Psychophysical scaling</head><p>An example of the proximity effect is shown <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. These figures indicate the increased variability in the CVP element when MPAP is abnormal. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> presents the average deviation score and standard deviation for the CVP element as a function of the MPAP template. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> presents the average deviation score for the CVP element as a function of the CVP template when PAP is normal.</p><p>An additional proximity effect was manifest with the CI and ST segment elements. The ST segment element affected the perception of CI only when ST was severe and the CI was enlarged to 140 pixels; t (5) = 2.894. p &lt; .004.</p><p>Despite the relative proximity of all elements in the display, regression analyses revealed no significant effect of adjacent elements on the deviation score variability for the MAP, SaO2 and ST segment elements. The SaO2 findings were of interest since the color changes seemed to effect perception independent of the other representational elements in the display.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Display implementation using psychophysical scaling and clinical relevance</head><p>The results of this study are used to optimally map the display to the data, given constraints of the size of the display. For example, an application of the cardiovascular display was to integrate it into an existing medical monitor, and the maximum height of the graphical portion of the display was constrained to 140 pixels. A JND of 3 pixels was justified as the basis for the mapping, since all deviation score values shown in Figures 6 and 7 were less than 3 pixels (except for the 140 pixel trial of the CVP template). <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> demonstrates an example of specifying the relationship of the CVP object's height in pixels to its data value in mmHg relationship. The other objects of the display have similar approach for mapping the data to the object's size.  <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>: Deviation scores used to derive the JNDs for the CVP element. The CVP deviation scores are shown as absolute pixel values for each MPAP template. There is a greater variability in the range of scores compared to <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> as a result of the proximity effect.</p><p>An objective of the display is to maintain a uniform appearance when the data values are within a range that is considered to be clinically normal; however, it is desired that the object is not static and conveys a clinically relevant rate of change to the user. Thus for normal range of CVP (2-10 mmHg), we specified that the object should change linearly and has a slope of 2.5 JNDs per unit of clinically relevant change (line B-D in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). This approach ensures that when CVP is normal, clinically significant changes will be perceived by the user. Yet the object's height will not change in excess, which could falsely indicate to the user that CVP is too low or high.</p><p>A second objective for the cardiovascular display is to enhance the "pop out" effect when CVP is out of the normal range. Just below the normal range, the CVP object's height exponentially decreases (line B-A in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). Just above the normal range, the CVP object's height increases logarithmically (line D-E in <ref type="figure">figure 8</ref>). As the CVP value increases significantly past the normal range, the rate of change of the object's height decreases below 1 JND per unit of significant change. Because point E is the value at which the data becomes less clinically relevant, perception of change by the user is not so important. A CVP of 20 mmHg and30 mmHg are both considered by clinicians to be dangerously high and the height of the object should reflect this by maintaining the object's height near the maximum of 140 pixels.</p><p>The same process of fitting a slope function to the data was applied to the remaining elements represented in the cardiovascular visualization. In the example of SaO2 color changes and ST segment depression, no change was necessary in the element mapping. The linear scales employed in the prototype were determined to be sufficient based on the JNDs derived for these elements. The mappings for the remaining elements (including MAP, MPAP and CI) were adjusted in a fashion similar to the CVP element. The combined information from the clinical relevance survey and the psychophysical scaling study should result element mapping that emphasizes meaningful changes in the status of the cardiovascular system, while minimizing unimportant changes in the underlying physiology. Figure 7: Deviation scores used to derive the JNDs for the CVP element. The CVP deviation scores are shown as absolute pixel values for each CVP template. JNDs for the CVP element were derived taking into account the entire variable range.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Based in part on the results of the psychophysical scaling study, the current visualization now indicates a physiologic variable moving out of a normal state by changing the size of the corresponding visual element in pixels according to the unique psychophysical properties of each element. By applying the psychophysical mappings to clinically relevant changes in cardiovascular variables, the saliency of clinically relevant changes should be optimized and readily apparent to the user. As a result the utility of the display as well as user performance should increase. The new cardiovascular visualization represents a clear departure from single sensor single indicator displays currently in use. By combining the same physiologic information available from current patient display monitors into a new visual representation, visualization is not only more intuitive in its representation of the anatomy of the cardiovascular system, but also designed to convey clinically meaningful changes in a patients physiology at a glance. Further performance testing with the psychophysically scaled visualization is currently being conducted.</p><p>Although the results of the study do not generalize beyond the specific domain of the cardiovascular visualization the underlying logic does. Information displays that utilize the domain specific parameter space and combine visual elements that are scaled to the parameters of the human visual information processing system should provide the user with an efficient means to maintain situational awareness in any application. The method applied here presents a cost effective and time saving means for achieving a more optimal scaling of variable changes in a visual display. The clinical significance analysis is limited in nature (n = 8 anesthesiologists) and a more refined dataset with should be compiled for more accurate results. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> indicates that some variables, such as SVR and PVR, had a large standard deviation in anesthesiologists' answers for clinical significance. When possible, clinically significant physiologic data values were used from references in the clinical literature. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>: The resulting mapping of the height of the CVP object derived from psychophysical scaling study and clinical relevance questionnaires. For the normal range of CVP (2-10 mmHg), the object's height changes at a rate of 2.5 JNDs per unit of clinically significance. The object is designed to "pop out" as soon as the data leaves the normal range. At very high values of CVP, the data is less relevant, and the number of JNDs per unit of clinical significance drops logarithmically. This process of using the results of the questionnaire to scale the JND mappings was applied to each element of the display.</p><p>For example, the normal range for the physiologic variables was not derived from the significance questionnaire, but values reported in the Handbook of Anesthesiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Ezekiel, 1997]</ref> were used instead. This method of assessing JNDs was limited such that it does not account for all of the potential proximity effects. In order to thoroughly test all 306 individual templates using the formal method of paired comparisons would require one subject 46,665 trials. To accomplish this end would require an enormous and typically unavailable amount of resources and time. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> shows the limited set of tests to find proximity effects for adjacent objects, but others may exist. For example, we assumed that a color change in SaO2 would not affect those objects (CVP, MPAP, PVR, etc.) that remain a single color; however, it is possible a color change in objects mapped to color could have proximity effects to those objects that do not change color. This assumption was based on preliminary findings not reported in this paper. Thus the rational selection of the number of JNDs per unit of significance may need to be more conservative. The number of proximity effect assessments was chosen as a balance between thoroughness and efficiency.</p><p>As more proximity effect assessments are added to the study, the number of trials required to derive the JNDs increase exponentially. Efficiency is necessary requirement for this methodology because a single change in the information display's design dictates a partial or complete reassessment of the display's perceptual properties.</p><p>Despite the number of limitations within the study, the end result is a more effective mapping of graphic element changes based on the clinical significance of the physiologic state. The findings directly relate to the real anesthesiologist who is the intended end user. The psychophysical properties remain constant between the undergraduate participants and the clinician in the OR. The clinically meaningful questionnaire directly queries clinicians who specialize in anesthesia, drawing upon the domain specific knowledge base to create a domain specific scale upon which to map the graphic element changes. The integration of these factors results in an efficient domain specific visualization that behaves in a clinically meaningful way and increases the overall situational awareness of the anesthesiologist. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>An example of the single sensor single indicator patient display monitors currently in use.</figDesc></figure>
