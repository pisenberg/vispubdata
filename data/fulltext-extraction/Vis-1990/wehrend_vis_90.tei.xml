				<p>Progress in scientific visualization could be accelerated if workers could more readily find visualization techniques relevant to a given problem. This paper describes an approach to this problem based on a classification of visualization techniques that is independent of particular application domains. A user breaks up a problem into subproblems, describes these subproblems in terms of the objects to be represented and the operations to be supported b y a representation, locates applicable visualization techniques i n a catalog, and c o m b i n e s these representations into a composite representation f o r the original p r o b l e m. The catalog and its underlying classification provide a way f o r workers in different application disciplines to share m e t h o d s .</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Users of visualization in different application disciplines lack a common conceptual framework in which to describe and share techniques. A worker trying to display the structure of a cube of earth image data whose coordinates are latitude, longitude, and spectral band may or may not find out about methods used by a worker displaying the structure of a cube of brain tissue, yet these problems clearly have much in common. This paper proposes a scheme for classifying visualization problems and their solutions that is independent of application domain. It aims to provide a common framework in which workers in any area can place their techniques, so that abstract similarities among problems in different application areas can be identified, and new techniques can be readily transported across application lines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract conceptions of representation</head><p>Workers in the theory of measurement (see for example <ref type="bibr">Krantz,</ref><ref type="bibr">Luce,</ref><ref type="bibr">Suppes,</ref><ref type="bibr">and Tversky [ 2 ]</ref> ) have provided ideas that can be extended to describe problems of representation generally.</p><p>A measurement system consists of a target domain of physical or conceptual objects, some relations on these objects, a measurement domain of mathematical objects, some relations on these, and mappings that connect objects and relations in the two domains. The system must satisfy the mathematical constraint that relations in the measurement domain be consistent with those in the target domain, so that (for example) two objects satisfy relation R in the target domain if and only if the corresponding objects in the measurement domain satisfy the mathematical relation that corresponds to R . To be useful it is further necessary that the mathematical relations that correspond to important relations in the target domain be easy to evaluate. For example, real numbers are a good representation for the lengths of physical objects, with addition of numbers corresponding to concatenation of objects and greater-than corresponding to longer-than, because addition and comparison of real numbers are easy to do.</p><p>Though the theory of measurement has concentrated on applications of this framework in which t h e measurement domain contains relatively simple mathematical objects, the framework readily accomodates any kind of representation. For example, the familiar bar chart simply exchanges the roles of the domains in the length example just mentioned: the lengths of physical bars on a display are used to represent real numbers, with comparison of the lengths of the bars being CH2913-2/90/0000/0139/$01 .OO -1990 IEEE used to avoid having to compare the numbers. The logic of a bar chart is clearly well described by the measurement framework, even though the "measurement domain" contains physical rather than mathematical objects in this case. T o mark this broadened application of the measurement framework we will substitute the t e r m " r e p r e s e n t a t i o n s y s t e m " f o r " me as u re m en t system " and "represent at i on domain" for "measurement domain" in our discussion. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>e ss and e f f e c t i v e n e s s criteria. The e x p r e s s i v e n e s s criterion is equivalent to the consistency</head><p>required for representation systems in the theory of measurement framework. A presentation is effective if the perceptual judgements it requires are easy to make. For example, a presentation of the density of compounds that maps compounds onto circles in a display and maps "denser than" onto "to the right of" will be more effective than one that maps "denser than" onto "larger", because comparing the positions of circles is easier than comparing their sizes. Thus the effectiveness criterion corresponds to the requirement within the representation framework that relations in the representation domain be easy to evaluate. Mackinlay 131 described an automated system capable of s e l e c t i n g e x p r e s s i v e a n d e f f e c t i v e representations for a wide range of problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Roth and Mattis [5] add another criterion for t h e</head><p>a p p r o p r i a t e n e s s of a graphical representation: the user's goals in viewing the representation. For example, someone viewing a display of the density of compounds may be interested only in how the densities compare, or may be interested in reading off accurate values for densities. No purely graphical representation is likely to be suitable in the latter case. Roth and Mattis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> provide a list of differing user goals, to which we return below.</p><p>Casner <ref type="bibr">[ l ]</ref> proposes a sophisticated analysis of user goals appropriate for representations intended to support complex tasks like airline flight selection, where many factors, including price, timing, airline preference, and seat availability must be used in coordination. Casner begins with a description of abstract operations logically adequate to perform the overall task, and selects representations that replace these abstract operations with easy perceptual operations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classifying visualization problems</head><p>Mackinlay, Roth and Mattis, and Casner all attack the problem of automating the selection of representation techniques. This demanding goal requires that all important aspects of a visualization problem be captured accurately, so that (for example) no representation violating the expressiveness criterion will be selected. The goal of supporting transfer of techniques among human workers is somewhat less demanding: a rough classification of techniques, augmented by the human user's judgement, may be adequate. We describe such a classification here; more details are presented in <ref type="bibr">Wehrend [ 6 ]</ref> .</p><p>In our approach visualization problems, and corresponding techniques, are placed in a matrix formed by two crossed classifications: objects and operations. Problems are divided in the objects classification in groupings based on the nature of the things in the target domain that must be represented. For example, objects in one problem may naturally be thought of as scalars, like temperatures or densities; objects in another problem may be thought of as positions, like cities on a small-scale map or the places where a measurement was taken; a city on a large-scale map is a s p a t i a l l y -e x t e n d e d region or object, rather than a position, since spatial relationships among parts of the city are relevant. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> lists the categories of objects that are discriminated in the classification.</p><p>The point of the objects classification is that different representations will be appropriate for objects falling into different classes. The many representations possible for scalars, such as bar length, hue (within a spectral range small enough to support order judgements), angle, and so on, are not suitable for representing positions, and vice-versa. Similarly some methods adequate for representing a collection of isolated scalars are not workable when some portion of an entire scalar field must be shown, where values must be closely-packed and connected to underlying positions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The point of the o p e r a t i o n s classification is to</head><p>distinguish problems for which the user's goal in viewing the representation differs. When the user wishes to read off the value of a scalar that is an i d e n f i f y problem; if he or she needs rather to determine which of two or more scalars is larger that is a c o m p a r e problem. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2 lists</ref>  When the objects and operations classifications are applied to problems, a matrix results with problems populating the cells. Visualization techniques can now be placed in this same matrix, simply by putting a given technique in the same cells as any problems for which it is appropriate. Placing techniques in the matrix in this way produces a c a t a l o g of techniques: to find appropriate techniques for a given problem one finds the appropriate cell for the problem and examines the techniques found there.</p><p>When visualization techniques are placed in the matrix formed by the objects and operations classifications, Mackinlay's expressiveness and effectiveness criteria are implicitly dealt with. The compare-scalar cell, for example, will contain only representations that map the ordering on the scalars onto an easy perceptual judgement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Using the classification</head><p>Real problems nearly always involve many kinds of objects and multiple user goals. To use this classification requires breaking such a problem apart into simple subproblems, each involving one kind of object and one operation. Representations for subproblems are not independent. For example, a problem may require different scalar fields over the same domain to be displayed, and one usually cannot use the same representation method, for example hue, for all of the fields. Using different representation methods for the fields runs into limitations if there are more a few of them. In such cases one may have to subdivide the original problem, and produce more than one separate representation.</p><p>Even when a complete, single representation of a problem is possible, the choices of representation for some subproblems may be highly constrained, so that less-desirable methods are used for some subproblems. In such cases the subproblems should be p r i o r i t i z e d , so that m o r e important subproblems are assigned desirable methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experience with the method</head><p>Wehrend </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Issues and limitations</head><p>Apart from the need for further study of the usefulness of this catalog, many matters remain to be addressed. While the classification scheme is informed in a general way by the mathematical structure of common object classes, the current classifications are not rigorously grounded. This is especially an issue with regard to complex objects like fields or structures. Is it appropriate to classify fields as objects on their own, or should fields be seen as complexes of simpler objects? Similarly, should a position be given .separate status in the classification or viewed as a structure of scalars? The current classifications reflect an e f f o r t to capture common superficial differences among problems, rather than to provide a cleaner but more abstract mathematical analysis.</p><p>On the other hand, some of the distinctions made in the classification do not appeal immediately to intuition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S h u p e s and</head><p>spatia 1 l yex t e nded objects or reg ions are intuitively quite similar; they differ abstractly in that shapes are defined independent of size, while spatially-extended regions or objects do have size. Thus "oblate sphere" is a shape, while Mars is a spatially-extended object. Similarly, representations with temporal aspects seem intuitively different from others, but time is treated like any other scalar in our classification as it stands.</p><p>The treatment of complex objects and operations on them is weak, though this may not be a major impediment to use. It remains to be seen whether consideration of the details of relationships among objects needs to be defined precisely to provide useful guidance to a person choosing a representation; as noted above such definitions are essential if a representation is to be chosen automatically.</p><p>The problem of combining representation methods for subproblems into an overall representation for a task is also not treated thoroughly. But here again, limited experience suggests that users may be able to solve this problem fairly easily without help from the catalog. It would be interesting to look carefully for examples in which separate analysis of subproblems is clearly inadequate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>At this stage of work it may be appropriate to separate the goals discussed here from accomplishments to date. While there are good grounds to question virtually any specific aspect of the catalog we describe, it nevertheless appears useful to attempt to develop some classification scheme along these lines. A scheme which combines a sound mathematical foundation with easy mapping to the elements of practical representation problems may be within reach.    <ref type="figure">System (hlOrplate55,page469)</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>the categories used in the operations classification and shows their relation to the categories discussed in Roth and Mattis [5].</figDesc></figure>

Reasonable placements were found for all examples.Wehrend then used the resulting catalog to develop a visual representation of the state of an irrigation system. This is a complex problem, requiring treatment of canal branches and their connections, reaches, which are segments of branches with approximately uniform dimensions and slope, water release points along reaches and at their ends, control gates and turnouts, and water quantities and flows. The problem was decomposed into thirteen subproblems, and representations chosen based on catalog entries for these. The resulting representation, shown inFigure 1, appears to b e an i m p r o v e m e n t o v e r e a r l i e r representations designed in an ad hoc manner.</figDesc></figure>
