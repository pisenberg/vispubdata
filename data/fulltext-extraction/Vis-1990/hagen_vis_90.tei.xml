				<p>The geometric modeling of free-form curves and surfaces is of a central importance for sophisticated CAD systems. Apart from the pure construction of these curves and surfaces, the analysis of their quality is equally important in fhe design process.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The purpose of this paper is to give a critical survey on surface interrogation methods. First we will disc u s several isoline and contouring techniques. Then we will present the reflection line method, which simulates the so-called light cage by computer graphics. The isophote method analyzes surfaces by determining lines of equal light intensity; silhouettes are special isophotes. A different approach to these problems are the mapping-techniques. Here the simulation of natural light effects by computer graphics is not used; the mapping methods recognize unwanted curvature regions by detecting singularities of a special mapping of the curve or surface to investigate. We will have a closer look at the polarity method and the k-orthotomics. Curvature plots are also a practical means of analyzing free-form surfaces. All these methods are effective, but generally need a lot of computational effort. It is therefore desirable to use these methods only for a fine analysis of critical regions. This is possible, if surface patches can be identified, which cannot contain such unwanted curvature regions. The free-form surface visualization by ray tracing is such a technique and will be discussed shortly.</p></div>

First we will consider a set of Bezier curves.   The above shown hair dryer was modeled from a presmoothed net of curves, where by the optimal curvature input at the patch corners was determined by a variational approach. The curvature plot compares the normal section curvature of the surface curve with the normal section curvature, which is obtained by setting the twist vectors to zero ( a standard type of error).
