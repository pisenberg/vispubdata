				<p>In a forecasting system f o r the Great Lakes, the data generated by the three-dimensional numerical model is visualized by a 3D/stereoscopic display module. The module consists of a control panel and a display window with the capability of interactively rendering the results. The event scheduling for scenario testing t o steer the SD numerical model is achieved by a similar panel. These panels set up the simulation and control the data flow between the graphics workstation and supercomputer. Many rendering methods, stereo image y and animation are incorporated t o display the results. Interaction between the user, the workstation and the supercomputer allows steering of the simulation and tracing of the simulation output. Distributed software for post-processing and volume rendering are also used t o enhance the representation. Further enhancement will provide operational predictions of Great Lakes physics and transport features with these visualization methods and control algorithms.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>A numerical model for forecasting three-dimensional currents, water levels and temperatures will be an important tool for predicting the effects of storms on the Great Lakes and facilitate planning for utilization of the Lakes' resources. The complexity and the large amount of data generated by this three-dimensional numerical model must be presented in an easy-tounderstand format and the authors are implementing an interactive visualization program to do so. This visualization program is presented in this paper as well as the scenario testing part of the Forecasting System which also requires interactive visual procedures to set parameters and events for the numerical model. This combination leads to a two part structure of h e visualization system: the control part which oversees the 3D model and the rendering program and directs the data flow between Cray supercomputer and Stardent graphics workstation; and the rendering program Jill L. <ref type="bibr">Kempf Robert E. Marshall</ref> The Ohio Supercomputer Graphics Project</p><p>The Ohio Supercomputer Center which has the necessary graphics and animation capabilities as well as the ability to recognize hydrodynamic features.</p><p>The control part first displays a control panel for setting parameters, scheduling events and issuing commands for steering the numerical model on the Cray Y-MP. After the first time step is reached, a second control panel and a canvas window are displayed. The second panel interactively controls the rendering while the calculation is still proceeding.</p><p>The rendering part combines animation with surface polygon rendering, transparency rendering, particle tracing, vector plotting and time trace plotting. Moreover, stereoscopic display can be activated when needed. Water surface, time traces of water elevations and temperature profiles at selected points are done in tracking fashion. Vector plotting, volumetric rendering, thermocline identification and particle tracing are done in a post-processing fashion. Volumetric rendering is done by the animation production Environment (apE) software [5] which is developed by the Ohio Supercomputer Graphics Project staff.</p><p>A simple test cast on Lake Erie <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>) is done in this paper to evaluate the efficiency of the visualization program. The known features of the Lake are compared with the rendering results to see if the visualization can depict the hydrodynamic features.</p><p>Future work to be completed for the Forecasting System are also discussed in this paper. Besides increasing the resolution of the simulation and real data input, methods for transmitting the rendered results to the public are also discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Forecasting System Concept</head><p>The Great Lakes Forecasting System and its prototype, the Lakes Erie Forecasting System, have been CH2913-2/90/0000/0194/$01 .OO -1990 IEEE 194 r is fully functional. The Data Display and Transmission Module is devoted to formulating the results in a useful form for the consumers and controlling the display of these results in an efficient and easily transmitted form. Currently, the Data Display Module is set up in a more specific way, mainly for use by the scientist instead of providing images for the general public. The highly interactive environment is provided for the scientist of effectively visualize the simulation results. The heart of the Modeling Module is a threedimensional turbulence model based on code due to G. Mellor and co-workers [3][11] made available to this project by the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory. The module employs stress-flux turbulence closure models in combination with a barotropic-baroclinic mode decomposition solution scheme which incorporates a vertical coordinate stretching. The grid resolution used with the Stardent for tracking and animation is 81 x 24 x 15 which corresponds to 5 km horizontal grid size and maximum about 4.5 meters vertical grid size.</p><p>The Data Assimilation Module collects the data necessary for the model forecasts and prepares it in the required input form. Real-time daily infrared data from the NOAA-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite are being integrated into the Data Assimilation Module as a means of providing Lake-wide surface temperatures and heat flux. <ref type="bibr">Merry et al. [9]</ref> are blending in-situ real-time collected temperature data with AVHRR data plus the National Data Buoy Center data to compose a time series of surface temperature distribution which coincides with the model grid. A scenario testing module was set up as a major system controller to generate test data for the display programs until the Data Assimilation Module</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development Environment</head><p>The hardware being used are the Cray Y-MP8/864 supercomputer and the Stardent Graphics Supercomputer model GS2000. The Cray Y-MP supercomputer has 8 processors and a main memory containing 64 megawords. The Stardent Graphics Supercomputer is designed to optimize the requirements of interactive graphics supercomputing applications: Its integer performance is 20 to 25 MIPS; its floating point performance is 40 MFLOPS; it has a 1280x1024 resolution graphics display; a 32 plane frame buffer; and can do polygon rendering at 150k, Gouraud shaded, zbuffered triangles per second. It has a 64 mbyte memory.</p><p>The software development environment can be separated into three parts: networking, user interface, and graphics subroutines. For networking, The UNIX o p eration system on Stardent and UNIX-like UNICOS operation system on the Cray simplify the network compatibility problem. Remote shells are evoked from the Stardent to control the processes on the Cray and UNIX pipes provide the transport mechanism for the data. For the user interface, the X Windows system and the Widget library in the Stardent are used to build the control panels. The control panels consist of labels, buttons and sliders, in which buttons and sliders are mutually activated in some applications to avoid overly complicated control panels. For graphics subroutines, a lower-level programming library called X Floating-point Device Interface (XFDI) on the Stardent is used along with the X double buffering (Xdb) library which provides stereo viewing and smooth animation. The volumetric rendering is performed by the apE software as there are no available subroutines in XFDI to perform the task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>System Control</head><p>Two control panels and a mouse controllable canvas window are displayed in the simulation. Buttons and sliders are built into the panels for simplifying parameter input, steering control and applications activation for running the numerical model and rendering results. Other functions can be activated by the mouse on the canvas window for more direct control.</p><p>The first control panel ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>) is devoted to controlling the numerical model. The control items include setting up the needed parameters, selecting the status of the run, scheduling events, and steering the simulation. The parameters that can be set include the simulation period, horizontal eddy diffusivity, time step, and output time. The user can select whether to start a run at a previous check point or from a new initial condition. A slider representing a time axis is used to schedule events. After an event is set, new buttons and sliders appear. These buttons and sliders are used to set the variables of an event, including starting time, heat flux, wind type, storm duration, storm stress, storm region, storm slope, background wind stress, and background wind direction. Buttons for update, delete and insert are provided to edit the events. For steering the simulation, pause and continue buttons are provided, along with a set of buttons activated by the time axis slider to edit the events after a pause.</p><p>After the simulation is started and the first time step is reached, another control panel ( <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>) is displayed. This panel consists of buttons to activate different functions such as displaying stereo objects, showing different kinds of objects, selecting different rendering methods, showing bounding box and spheres, evoking 2D and 3D particle tracing, evoking time tracing plot for water elevations and temperature profiles, controlling animation and reset. The panel also consists of three sliders for setting the t r a n s parency factor, the rendering scale, and the particle size for the particle tracing.</p><p>Direct mouse control on the canvas window can perform translation and rotation of the object, set the light source direction, set the location for a time trace plot, and set particles for the tracing application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rendering the Results</head><p>The output variables and features need different rendering techniques for meaningful interpretation. Therefore, providing several rendering methods for the variables is an essential task of the system. The rendering techniques used are surface polygon rendering, transparency rendering, particle tracing, vector plotting, time trace plotting and volumetric rendering. Particle tracing, vector plotting and volume rendering are done in post-processing fashion. All other techniques track the output of the simulation and display each frame as the calculation proceeds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rendering Methods</head><p>Most of the rendering subroutines used in this project are XFDI subroutines because XFDI calls can directly access the maximum performance of the hardware. Polygon rendering is used for bottom topography, water surface elevation, and thermocline (a location between the warm upper layer and the cool lower layer, which vertical temperature gradient changes sharply) rendering because they are 3D surfaces. Gouraud shading and Phong shading as well as a wire frame representation are provided. Different surface attributes such as lighting model, material, and shading can be set by XFDI subroutines. Wire frame rendering is achieved by drawing a quad mesh with colors at vertices. The color of each vertex is assigned according to the depth which separates water and land.</p><p>Another surface attribute is transparency which is used for simultaneous display of the water surface, thermocline, and the lake bottom if the user chooses to do so. This rendering method is useful for the internal wave animation sequence which depicts the interaction of the water surface, thermocline and the lake bottom when storms pass. Transparency is actived by a transparency setting subroutine in XFDI which sets the transparency factor of the rendering surfaces. A slider in the control panel can change the transparency factor if needed.</p><p>The clearest way to depict a velocity field is by particle tracing. Using a particle tracing technique, the direction of the coastal jet, the upwelling and downwelling effect and the overall currents can be clearly shown. Due to the XFDI subroutine which draws series of colored spheres quickly, realistic particles and high speed animation are feasible. The locations of the particles can be set by using the mouse directly on the display window. For vertically integrated (averaged) velocity field, particles can be set either within the 2D grid cells one by one, or on grid points whose depth is greater than zero along the Y axis for a certain X coordinate. For the 3D velocity field, the particles can be set on grid points which are on the YZ plane for a certain X coordinate. The paths of the particle set are calculated on the Cray which receives the original co-ordinates of the particles, calculates the new locations at each time step and then sends them back over the network.</p><p>Vector plotting is provided in this system for 2D velocity fields only. The averaged velocities are in twodimensional space and rendering is done only in 2D space, nevertheless, the directions of the vectors are still easily confused. To solve the problem, the XFDI subroutine which draws a alternating series of lines with colors at vertices is used. The origin of each vector thus is set to blue and the other tip is set to red. A program on the Cray is used to retrieve the data after the numerical model runs and sends them to the Stardent.</p><p>Although a realistic rendering of the simulation is very good for visualizing the actual situation, time trace plots are still very important for analyzing the time series data. Due to the 2D property of the time trace plots and the lack of character handling capabilities in XFDI, the time trace plots are generated by normal X Windows calls. The two time trace plots currently available are water elevation and vertical temperature profile. Five locations for time trace plots can be selected by the mouse directly on the canvas window. Colored spheres are used to mark the location while corresponding colored lines are drawn on the windows for the two time trace plots.</p><p>While complicated shading methods can render a smooth and realistic scene, the depth perception of an object sometimes needs the technique of stereoscopic graphics to enhance it. An external lens with a modulator in front of the display screen toggles a frame buffer pointer in the program while flipping the polarization of the lens at the same time to alternate the display and interlace left eye and right eye images. The user wears passive glasses with opposite polarization for each eye to see its view. Stereo pairs are generated through a simple rotation of a scene by about four to seven degrees around a vertical axis. These actions "trick" the human brain into seeing a scene with depth perception. Special subroutines in the Xdb library provide the ability to change stereo views and correspond to the modulator.</p><p>Animation techniques are essential for a comprehensive time series data as demonstrated in the previous computer animation study of Lake Erie storm surges [8]. With the help of the fast rendering speed of the graphics workstation, the smooth shading, particle rendering and time trace plotting are displayed and animated at the same time in a near real time fashion which was not feasible in the previous study. This can be a great help for users in understanding the time variation of the simulated results. The double buffering calls in the Xdb library contribute to this smooth animation. The smooth animation is started as soon as the last frame is calculated and sent back from the Cray or when the simulation is paused by the user. This feature lets the user view the animation of the calculated results before completing the full simulation and possibly terminating the calculation to save computational time if results are incorrect at an early stage.</p><p>The miscellaneous display items such as the bounding box and spheres on the corners are provided in the control panel. The bounding box and colored spheres give the user a geometric verification. The colored spheres also give the user a good idea about the light direction.</p><p>The final rendering method not directly controlled by the control panel, but is very important in the sense of complicated data rendering. A volumetric rendering subroutine in apE is used to visualize the temperature data and is based on techniques developed by Marc <ref type="bibr">LeVoy [7]</ref>. Combining the color key and ray tracing techniques, this method depicts the temperature gradient easily by using the gradient to set the opacity of each voxel, thus, the thermocline can be extracted and displayed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rendering Procedures</head><p>The rendering can be separated into two techniques. The tracking technique renders images as the calculation proceeds, but with no control over the parameters of the simulation other than termination. The postprocessing technique displays images after the calculation is fully stopped. The series data files, previously generated by the simulation, are used as input to the Display Module. No control flow or bi-directional data flow exists between the numerical model calculation and post-processing. A previous paper [lo] contain more detailed descriptions about these techniques.</p><p>The tracking procedures in this system are the display of the water surface elevations and the vertical temperature profiles. Water surface elevations are generated by the numerical model as a standard output and piped to the Stardent for surface polygon rendering. Temperature data are generated by the numerical model as an unformatted, direct access file. As the file is being generated, the program on the Stardent issues a command to convert and ncatn the existing portion through network where it is finally read as an ASCII file. Because multiple UNIX remote shell operations can operate in parallel, tracking more than one variable in a simulation is possible.</p><p>After the calculation is done, all the necessary files are available on the Cray. Therefore, post-processing is only a matter of reading files over the network and performing the selected application. Small p r e grams for calculating the 2D particle paths, 3D particle paths, thermocline location and reading 2D velocities are made on the Cray for speed and easy data access. Only the processed data are sent back to the 10cal Stardent workstation for display. Because receiving a file, opening a file and data input must be performed in sequence, the post-processing operations can not be done in a parallel way, thus, the control panel hangs and no application is performed while the calculation and data transfer proceed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test Cases and Comparison</head><p>The essential parts of the visualization system have been described and this section will demonstrate the application of the system for a simple storm. Events are being scheduled as the storm travels down the long axis of the Lake within 14 hours with the wind stress of 25 dyne/cm2 and a 5 dyne/cm2 background wind stress. The general features of the Great Lakes storm response are summarized in <ref type="bibr">Boyce et al. [4]</ref> which is used here for comparing the rendering results of the simulation.</p><p>After the system control panel is displayed, parameters can be set through sliders and buttons. The period of this test case is set to 72 hours. The horizontal eddy diffusivity is set to 100 m2/sec. The internal time is set at 1200 seconds and the external time step is 25 seconds. To set the output time, the mouse is use to move the nob on the time axis slider. Three buttons will be displayed for selecting time to be the starting time (24 hour), the ending time (72 hour) or the time increment (1 hour) of the desired output.</p><p>The mouse is used again to pick the times for sequential events. Several button will be actived after a time is selected. Through these buttons, the user can select the type of wind, set the heat flux, set the check point, and edit events before or after the start of the simulation. The wind type selection will also activate several buttons and sliders to set the appropriate attributes. For the test case, the 0 hour is set as the first event with a background wind stress of 5 dyne/cm2 and the direction of 247 degree to the north. The heat flux is set to be 100 J/(m2sec). The spin up period is 48 hours, therefore, the next event will be put at 48 hours from start. This event will be the storm that passes over the Lake. The wind stress will increases to 25 dyne/cm2 and the heat flux will remains the same. Although more characteristics of the storm can be set, the rest of the parameters use the default values. The background wind of this event will be used as the background wind when the storm passes over the Lake. It is set as the opposite direction of the 0 hour background wind with the same stress value. As the events are scheduled, the simulation can be started by hitting the "Start Simulation" button. The steering capability has been demonstrated in the previous study <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>.</p><p>While the calculation is going on, the Cray sends the results of each time step to the Stardent. The results can be displayed with different rendering methods. The user can experiment with the methods using the interactive control panel. After the calculation is done, the 48 frames of images will start animating. Different applications can be evoked during and after the calculation to visualize the results <ref type="figure">(Figure 4)</ref>.</p><p>For comparing the results, six general features mentioned in the Boyce et al. paper are sought. First, the thermocline of the Lake is formed noticeable in the Eastern Basin of Lake Erie even though the simulation period is only three days. The Western and Central basins show little stratification due to their shallowness and near-uniform offshore depths. This feature is depicted using time trace plot of the vertical temperature profiles <ref type="figure">(Figure 5 )</ref> . Evidence of stratification was also obtained by using volume rendering <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> as <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows. The second feature is formed because in the closed basin the transport of water through any cro85 section over the period of the surface seiche must be zero. Thus, surface wind-driven transport must be balanced by a subsurface flow. The velocity field of such circulation is complicated. However, through the 2D particle tracing and vector plotting methods, the balancing return transport occurs in the middle of the Lake is clearly shown <ref type="figure">(Figure 7)</ref>. Third, with the 3D particle tracing method, the downwelling on the north shore and upwelling on the south shore due to prevailing wind align the long axis of the Lake can be observed <ref type="figure">(Figure 8)</ref>. Forth, the balance between the pressure gradients and the Coriolis force limits the upwelling and downwelling zones to narrow bands along the shoreline can also be seen <ref type="figure">(Figure 8</ref>) with 3D particle tracing techniques. The fifth feature is the storm surge set up by the stress band passing across the Lake. It can be recognized by the water surface polygon rendering and water elevation time trace plots <ref type="figure">(Figure 9</ref>). The final feature is the well known 14 hour fundamental oscillation period of Lake Erie. This can be seen by the animated water surface and also the time trace plots <ref type="figure">(Figure 9</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future Work</head><p>To provide adequte forecasts, the resolution of the grid needs to be increased and the Data Assimilation Module and Archive Module need to be added as well as the related control panels. From the visualization point of view, to make this project an operational system, additional Transmission Module and rendering methods need to be created and enhanced.</p><p>The current resolution of the grid is 5 km for the steering and tracking operations. The production runs for the Forecasting System will use a 0.5 km grid. Issues involving networking and rendering this increased amount of data need to be addressed as well as the processing priority of large jobs on the Cray.</p><p>From the visualization aspect, the volumetric rendering for tracking and on-canvas interaction should be accommodated within the visualization system on the Stardent. Furthermore, developing procedures for feature identification will continue as well as rendering derived data which are key indicators for many hydrodynamic features. A rendering method of using a series of flags or glyphs for the combination of vector plotting, color key plotting and size key plotting will be a great aid to a clear presentation. Beside the main stream of the visualization, another important area is bringing the images to the public. The Transmission Module related to the visualization thus needs to be set up. A control panel can be set up for selecting hard copy generation option which will plot out a series of stereo pair images on paper, or for a screen dump option which will create screen images for different kinds of personal computers or workstation. The volumetric rendering for tracking and on-canvas interaction may be accomodated within the visualization system on Stardent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>How to visualize the enormous data generated by three-dimensional numerical models has perpetually intrigued scientists who want their results be clearly understood by others as well as themselves. Due to the importance of weather prediction and meteorology, primitive visualization techniques were implemented quite some time ago at the very beginning of the devel- opment of multi-dimensional numerical weather forecasting. With the recent advances in high speed computer technology, the spatial and temporal resolution of the forecast can be increased to depict small yet important features which allow increasing reality to be computed. High speed rendering hardware can now present realistic rendering and smooth animations and provide a design environment for highly interactive interfaces. Therefore, the time related characteristics of Great Lakes can be forecasted analogously to the weather forecasts, and be fully visualized. Because the increasing activities around the Great Lakes, such Forecasts System can be a great help to the 30 million people living in the Great Lakes Region which is one third of the population of Canada, and one eighth of the population of the United States <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. Although the the complexity of the Great Lakes h y d r e dynamic features such as the small scale turbulence mixing, the thermo structure, the tributary flows, and the resonance etc. are unique compare to the weather forecasts, the operational Forecasts System can be achieved due to the hardware and software improvement. This project proves the preliminary feasibility of the Forecasting System.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Lake Erie Bottom Topography explained in several papers [1][2][6].
