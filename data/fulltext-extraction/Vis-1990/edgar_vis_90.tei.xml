				<p>This case study describes how visualization tools were used in a non-linear FEM analysis of rivet deformation. After summarizing the client engineer&apos;s problems, we show how visualization techniques helped achieve a solution. We then analyze why the visualization tools worked. Visualization increased productiviry eight-fold and led to successjid project completion.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>An engineer appeared to the author with the following problems: first, he was viewing isolated data steps, visually unconnected to any others; second, he dealt with a confusion of monochrome contour plots; third, the data displays initially available did not provide sufficient information to discem the reasons for problems. As a consequence the engineer's progress was very slow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Four Problems</head><p>The initial problems, prior to visualization, may be broken down into four basic types--display format, the region of interest, display scaling control, and visualization software data format. We discuss each of these below.</p><p>Initially, the display format was fixed as a monochrome contour plot <ref type="figure">(Figure 1)</ref>. The information presented in the plots confused the viewer because of the contours close proximity. This prevented his determining why the input model failed. Because of the confusion in the single data display format, there needed to be alternatives in showing the data in order to understand it. The visualization tool made available many different formats of data display, among then were-vector arrows, color-shaded contours (color fringes), and color contour line drawings. The most useful style, which presented a maximum of information with a minimum of confusion proved to be color-shaded contour displays ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>) with an overlay of the grid used for the solution step.</p><p>At the start the image was of the entire model, with no user control over what area to display. Visualization enabled the engineer to focus on specific regions of the model without being distracted by other areas of less interest. Management of the region to be displayed enabled the engineer to obtain more accurate information.</p><p>Before visualization the engineer saw only disconnected images of the complete simulation, which had 31 discrete steps. The -lay tool provided the means for animation through the sequential display of all 31 images. The animation greatly aided the engineer, as well as making the simulation more understandable to those not intimately familiar with</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FEM.</head><p>The final aspect of this case was the processing of the data by the visualization software. Initially the graphics were generated by software from the analysis vendor. The final visualization tool obtained from another vendor, required a input format quite different from the FEM analysis output. (Currently there is no standard output format or data management system supported by the majority of FEM analysis package vendors.) Hence, a translator was needed to retrieve any of the seven sorts of data produced by the analysis package. The engineer also needed some degree of configuration control so he knew which of the several versions of models was displayed. The initial translator did not provide these data management facilities; however these features were easily added, and they enhanced the visualization system considerably.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Principles For Making Visualization A Success</head><p>Three factors which aided the visualization process in this case can be extracted as general principles: first, focus the viewer on the area of interest; second, do not confuse the viewer with strange color scales; and CH28192/80XXXXllW201 .OO -1990 IEEE finally, do not try to convey too much information in one image. Images should convey a maximum amount of information with a minimum of confusion. Use of these three principles enabled the author, who is not an engineer, to assist in the visualization process and help the project be a better success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In this case study the most useful techniques proved to be animations of color-shaded contours, where the viewer could zoom in on any area of particular interest. Animation was used for each of the seven different data types produced by the analysis package. The resulting images enabled the client engineer to make more progress in one week than he had in the previous two months. They also made the analysis far more understandable to the engineer's customer and his management. Communication aspects of visualization made this technique even more valuable than just an improvement in productivity. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>BibliographyFigure 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>ABAQUS User's Manual, Hibbitt, Karlsson and Cray Research Inc.
