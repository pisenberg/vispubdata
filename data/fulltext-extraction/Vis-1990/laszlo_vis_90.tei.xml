<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Computer graphics has long been concerned with representing and displaying surfaces in 3-dimensional space 3'. We address the questions of representation and display in a higher dimensional setting. Threemanifolds, the 3-dimensional version of a surface, are treated by the mathematical branches of topology and geometry. They arise in various scientific disciplines, such as cosmology ("What is the global structure of the universe?").</p><p>Author presently at Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Miami, FL. This work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant CCR-8908933.</p><p>One may attempt to grasp a 3-manifold in spatial terms, imagining how it curves in n-space or turns back upon itself, yet usually these objects prove difficult to picture. The basic difficulty in visualizing a 3-manifold arises from the fact that mapping a higher-dimensional space to a 2-dimensional screen (or retina) inevitably results in loss of information. To overcome this, one constructs multiple views of a given manifold, usually in the form of a set of still pictures, or an animation, or via an interactive system. Interactively manipulating views of a manifold is probably the best way to appreciate it visually, since the approach corresponds to the way in which we understand an ordinary object of the real world by moving around it or handling it. Unfortunately, the computing demands of a highly interactive system requires compromises, ranging from the use of fairly primitive display techniques, to severe restrictions on the type of manifold that can be viewed.</p><p>We describe a technique for constructing and interactively visualizing a 3-manifold M . A view of M is given by a cross-section, the intersection of M by some cutting hyperplane. Manifold M is represented by a complex of tetrahedra, and the cross-section surface( s) is computed on a per tetrahedron basis. The data structure used for the complex of tetrahedra efficiently supports the queries needed to calculate the cross-section surface, as well as curvature of the surface and the manifold itself for the purpose of shading and coloring. We have implemented our techniques on a Silicon Graphics Personal IRIS. Furthermore, these techniques readily parallelize. We are presently implementing them on a Connection Machine, whose fine-grain parallelism is expected to support a highly-interactive system.</p><p>In this paper, after first presenting background material, we discuss how a %manifold is described, and how CH2913-2/90/0000/0342/$01 .OO -1990 IEEE</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Figure 1: Polyhedral model for the 3-torus S' x S' x S'.</formula><p>it is decomposed into tetrahedra. We then describe the data structure used to represent the tetrahedrized manifold, and how it supports visualization. We go on to present an examplevisualization of a solid torus-and finally conclude with some observations and directions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background 2.1 Definitions</head><p>A tmanafold M is the 3-dimensional version of a surface. Its local topology is that of 3-space !Jt3; every neighborhood of arbitrary point p E M contains an open set U (p E U) homeomorphic to the open solid ball. Since we will be treating only 3-dimensional manifolds, in this paper we refer to them simply as manifolds.</p><p>Many manifolds M can be described by means of a polyhedral model PI which consists of a solid polyhedron P in which pairs of facets are identified. The manifold is the quotient space formed by P modulo the relation indicated by the facet identifications. An example is depicted by <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Pairs of facets with like-shaded arrows are identified in such a way that the two arrows coincide. One can imagine (with some difficulty perhaps) deforming P so that all pairs of identified facets may be glued together, "twisting" P as necessary so that the facets mate properly.</p><p>A triangulation of P is a decomposition IC of P into tetrahedra. IC is a finite set of tetrahedra whose union is PI and for which, i f s n t # 0 for s , t E IC, then s n t is a vertex, edge or facet of both s and t .</p><p>An immersion of P in R4 is a locally one-to-one, continuous mapping q5 : P + SZ4. The immersed manifold may have self-intersection points, points which have a t least two pre-images. In section 6, we work with an immersion of the solid 3-torus in R4 (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Our particular example is actually an embedding since no selfintersection actually occurs.</p><p>A hyperplane (with respect to SZ4) is a 3dimensional affine space. Given hyperplane H C SZ", a cross-section of imbedded manifold M is the space M H = M n H. If non-empty, M H is a not-necessarily-connected surface. H is called the cutting hyperplane. The notion analogizes that of a plane which slices through a surface in SZ3; the cross-section (the intersection of plane and surface) is a set of zero or more plane curves.</p><p>The reader is referred t o [ST, Th, We] for an elementary introduction to these topics. The last of these references provides a remarkably pictorial account of 3manifolds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Previous Research</head><p>Projection and cross-section are the two most widely used viewing models for forming an image of a manifold. Projection maps the entire manifold to the image plane (up to visibility); however, many different points of the manifold may map to the same pixel under distincf projectors, and it is not clear what should be displayed at such pixels. (To see this, consider projection in a setting one dimension lower-projecting a surface in 9 2 ' to the real line 3. Given point p E 92, all points of the surface lying in the plane orthogonal to SZ at p project to point p.) The cross-section, defined in the previous subsection, is a surface which may be examined with conventional 3D computer graphics. However, the cross-section ignores those regions of the manifold which do not intersect the cutting hyperplane. Both viewing models result in loss of information P o ] .</p><p>The problem is usually overcome by providing multiple views of the same manifold. Multiple views may consist of a small set of static pictures <ref type="bibr">[KBBL]</ref>, or an animation in which viewing parameters vary with time [No], or stereo views <ref type="bibr">[BrD]</ref>, or an interactive system which permits a user to vary viewing parameters interactively. Color is often used to correlate the various views. Distinct features of a manifold, such as the facets of a 4dimensional polyhedron, may be pre-assigned different colors. Alternatively, color may indicate properties of the manifold (such as curvature) which obtain consistently across the different views.</p><p>Much recent work in volume visualization proves applicable to the visualization of manifolds. Given scalar valued mapping F defined over connected region A c 'R3, we can define function F' :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A + 'R4 by F'(z, y , z) = ( z , y , z , w ) where w = F ( z , y , r ) . The isevalued sur- face { p E A I F ( p ) = W O }</formula><p>is precisely the pre-image of the cross-section of F'(A) by cutting hyperplane w = W O .</p><p>Calculation and display of iso-valued surfaces is treated in <ref type="bibr">[DCH, Le, Sa, LC]</ref>. The last reference describes a technique for constructing a polygonal-mesh representation of an iso-valued surface. We employ a similar technique for building a cross-section surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Triangulating the Polyhedral Model</head><p>Solid polyhedron P is triangulated using a two-stage site generation approach. First, a finite set S of points (called sites) is generated in the interior and boundary of P . Second, a triangulation is constructed over Sthat is, the sites of S serve as vertices of the tetrahedra.</p><p>The site generation approach supports considerable control over local fineness of the triangulation; the triangulation is finer where there is a high concentration of sites.</p></div>

The samples obtained at the nodes of the lattice serve as a discrete density function for curvature. The nodes are "unfolded" into a linear sequence, from which a onedimensional cumulative distribution table is computed. The table is used to generate sites using the Monte Carlo method. When a node of the lattice is selected, a site is generated at random (uniformly) in the vicinity of that node.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Generating Boundary Sites</head><p>Sites in the boundary of P are selected so that. pairs of identified (convex) facets f , f' E P can be mated. Specifically, the 2dimensional meshes induced in f and f' by the triangulation of P must be congruent.</p><p>Let facet f = <ref type="bibr">(v1,v2,.-.,vn)</ref> and f' = <ref type="bibr">( v~, v~, . . . , v~)</ref> , and assume that the facets are aligned so that vertices vi and vi mate, for i = 1 , 2 , . . . , n. To generate matching sites s E f and s' E f', we define s and s' by a convex combination of vertices vi and U:, respectively, using the same coefficients for each. That is, having generated random numbers r l , r 2 , . --, r , for which cri = 1, we</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">define s = c r i v i E f and s' = c r i v i E f'. Our tri-</formula><p>angulation algorithm ensures that the resulting meshes in f and f' are congruent. Sites are also generated a t each vertex of P , to ensures that the resulting triangulation covers P . In addition, sites are generated along the edges of P to reduce the number of long "sliver" tetrahedra.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Building the Triangulation</head><p>We construct a Delaunay triangulation 7 ( S ) over the site set S. The Delaunay triangulation may be defined in various ways. One definition states that a set of four sites S' c S determine a tetrahedron of 7 ( S ) if and only if the unique sphere determined by S' (ie. the circumsphere of S') contains no site in its interior. If it is the case that no five sites of S are cospherical, then the Delaunay triangulation is unique [PSI.</p><p>We use the Delaunay triangulation for several reasons. First, the triangulation is more fine in regions of high site concentration. Second, 7 ( S ) covers P exactly (ie. utE7(s)t = P ) if S contains the extreme points of P .</p><p>Third, tetrahedra tend to be well-proportioned-the ratio of radii of circumsphere to insphere tends to 3 (the ratio of radii in the regular tetrahedron). Such tetrahedra encourage numerical stability in the hyperplane and is incident to only one tetrahedron. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>, procedure call tetrahedron(f) seeks a tetrahedron t , determined by the three vertices off and a fourth site s which lies in the side of f not yet examined. That site s is selected for which the radius of the circumsphere oft, is minimal-this ensures that the interior of the circumsphere contains no sites, so that tetrahedron t , belongs to the triangulation <ref type="bibr">[AB]</ref>. Usually, site s lies near facet f . Our implementation therefore first seeks s in the vicinity off, then gradually cross-section calculations. Although some long, narrow expands the search outward from f if necessary. This "slivers" are produced, these tend to be few in number. is accomplished by a preprocessing stage which divides We hasten to note that this has been our observation, space into cubes, then drops each site into its approprialthough we know of no formal property possessed by ate cube. Procedure call tetrahedron(f) examines sites %dimensional Delaunay triangulations in this regard.</p><p>in those cubes (roughly) in order of increasing distance A stereo image of a Delaunay triangulation of the cube from f.</p><p>is presented by <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. To get the 3D effect, hold at Although the algorithm's worst-case time complexarms length, cross your eyes slightly, and focus upon the ity is O(lS13), the use of this search heuristic, together middle of the three images which form. with the fact that the expected size of a triangulation We describe the algorithm we use to build a De-is O(lSl), permits triangulations to be generated over lauany triangulation over site set S <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 3)</ref>. The al-large site sets S fairly quickly. The triangulations with gorithm incrementally "grows" a current triangulation, which we regularly work consist on the order of 25000 iteratively discovering a new tetrahedron which attaches tetrahedra over about 4200 sites. It is constructed in  about 12 CPU minutes when an underlying 203 grid of cubes is used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">The Data Structure</head><p>The data structure for the triangulated manifold represents not only the constituent tetrahedra, but also certain relations that hold among them. Specifically, each tetrahedon points to the four tetrahedra adjacent to it. Given an edge e of the triangulation, it is then possible to visit the tetrahedra incident to e in their cyclic order about the edge. This operation is used to smooth-shade cross-section surface M H . To compute the average normal to a vertex v E M H , the tetrahedra incident to the manifold edge to which v belongs can be visited in turn. Each such tetrahedron intersects the cutting hyperplane H in a triangle or quadrilateral, the normal to which contributes to the average normal at U. The data structure, described by <ref type="bibr">[HW]</ref>, assigns each tetrahedron t a unique integer identifier, and the four vertices o f t distinct labels 0 through 3. The vertex labels are assigned arbitrarily and are local to t-the other tetrahedra sharing a vertex may assign the vertex different labels. Each facet oft is assigned the label of the vertex of t opposite it. Each tetrahedron t is represented by a record nt, which holds geometrical data (the location of each of t's vertices under the imbedding), as well as topological data which we now describe. Record nt pos- may then be applied to P to obtain the next tetrahedron about the same edge. The procedure tnext is defined in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref> .</p><p>5 Visualizing the Manifold</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Constructing the Cross-Section</head><p>The cross-section is calculated by computing the crosssection polygon t H = t r l H for each tetrahedron t of (triangulated) manifold M . Polygon t H is a (possibly degenerate) triangle or quadrilateral. The polygon is non-empty if and only if at least one of the vertices of t is above or on cutting hyperplane H, and one below. To compute t H , we assign to each vertex v o f t a 1 (0) if v is above or on (below) H. Since each of the tetrahedron's four vertices assumes either of two states, the hyperplane can intersect the tetrahedron in 24 = 16 different ways, ignoring symmetries. The local labels of vertices prescribes how the vertex states are concatenated to form an integer between 0 and 15 inclusive. The integer serves as an index into a table which describes all possible types of intersection. Linear interpolation is used to determine the precise position of the cross-section polygon's vertices. The technique is similar to the "marching cubes" algorithm for constructing iso-valued surfaces from 3dimensional discrete data [LC]. changes rapidly with respect to translation of H, the manifold has high curvature; where hue changes slowly, low curvature. Although hue and brightness correspond to different properties, use of Gouraud shading to interpolate both color components permits the use of fast graphics shading hardware. Note that Gouraud shading is implicitly used to interpolate orientation angle over the entire tetrahedron to which a given cross-section polygon belongs (although the calculation is explicitly carried out only over the polygon).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">An Example: The Solid Torus</head><p>Let us define an immersion 4 : P -+ S4 for polyhedral model P <ref type="figure">(Figure l)</ref>, the 3-dimensional torus S' x S' x S'. Where S' represents the circle, the 3-torus M = 4 ( P ) can be regarded as the product of circle S' and 2-torus S' x S'. Let immersion 4 be given by z(e,$,a) = cosa(a+cos$(b+cos8)) y(8,$,a) = sin$(b+cos8) %(8,$,a) = sin8 w(e,$,a) = sina(a+cos$J(b+cosfl)) where 0 5 e,$, a &lt; 2 r , and a-1 &gt; b &gt; 1 for constants a and b. M is a circle of 2-tori M ( a ) around the yz-plane.</p><p>Let the x,-axis be normal to the yz-plane, and form with the x-axis an angle of a radians. Each M ( a ) lies in xayz-space, and occurs as an annulus in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6a</ref>, and as a 2-torus in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6b</ref>.  Cai = M ( a ; ) n H,, is a set of zero or more curves in z,,yz-space. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">figure 6d</ref>, which depicts each M ( a ) in a common xayz-space, C,, consists of two curves while C,, is a single curve. As a increases from 0 to 2s, these curves may be "stacked" to form the cross-section surface M n H,,. To stack the curves, one imagines curve(s) Ca, being continuously (and uniformly) deformed across M ( a ) until it coincides with cal. The cross-section surface resulting from figure 6 is a 2-torus with two handles, pictured in Plate 4.</p><p>Plates 1 through 8 display a sequence cross-sections of 3-torus M as W O increases from 0.1 (Plate 1) to 6.6 (Plate 8). The constants a = 4 and b = 2 are used. The cutting hyperplanes H,, are all of the form w = W O for various constants W O . Stable regions of the cross-section surface (orientation angle x x/2) are colored blue, contractive regions range from blue t o magenta to red (as the orientation angle varies from s / 2 to 0), and expansive regions range from blue to cyan to green (as the orientation angle varies from s / 2 to T). The triangulation consists of 39,890 tetrahedra over 6500 sites. Plate 4, in which the cutting hyperplane intersects the most number of tetrahedra (7075), took 18 CPU seconds to produce on a personal IRIS. The other plates took less time to produce; Plate 8, which represents the least number of intersections (438), required about 1 CPU second.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Future Research and Conclusion</head><p>We are presently implementing these techniques on the Connection Machine, in order to achieve a highlyinteractive system. The pre-processing phases (which culminate in the data structure of Section 4) are performed on a sequential computer. The data structure is then downloaded to the Connection Machine. Each tetrahedron record is assigned a virtual processor, capable of computing its cross-section polygon formed by intersection with the current cutting hyperplane. Hue and brightness calculations are achieved by routing messages among the tetrahedra. A cell-tuple serves as the address of a message, and procedure tnext is used to compute the address to which a recieved message is to be forwarded. An important question addresses our choice of the Delaunay triangulation for decomposing the polyhedral model. An imbedded 3-manifold having high curvature (or change in curvature) generally requires a large triangulation to be well-approximated. The data structure might then use excessive memory. In such cases, the Delaunay triangulation might best be replaced by a regular, semi-regular or hierarchical decomposition which can be represented more concisely. What is a good decomposition of space, which uses relatively little memory yet also satisfies the desirable properties (discussed in Subsection 3.3) possessed by the Delaunay triangulation?</p><p>Another question concerns the behavior of these techniques in the vicinity of a self-intersection. In such regions, the index of a tetrahedron need not correctly indicate the manifold's behavior within the tetrahedron. Some device is needed to detect and analyze local selfintersections. This is also of concern in regions where distinct connected-components of the cross-section surface are very near one another.</p><p>Other questions concern the applicability of these techniques. What is the best way to handle nonorientable manifolds, particularly where two tetrahedra share a facet across which orientation is reversed? Can we characterize the class of manifolds amenable to these methods? Can these techniques be enhanced, or new techniques developed, t o treat less-well behaved manifolds? These questions require further research into 3-dimensional topology and geometry, as well as data structure design.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Stereo image of triangulated cube.

It starts by discovering, and inserting into dictionary F, a facet of the triangulation belonging to the boundary of P. At each step, dictionary 3 holds those facets of the current triangulation for which an incident tetrahedron has been sought on exactly one (and not the other) side of the facet. An iteration consists of deleting some facet f from F, then seeking a tetrahedron t incident to f on the side off not yet examined. If t exists, each of its four facets in turn is deleted from 3 if present, otherwise inserted into 3. If t does not exist, then facet f lies in the boundary of P</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Brightness and hue are used to portray distinct p r o p erties. Brightness (shading) suggests how cross-section surface M H is immersed in the 3-dimensional hyperplane H. The (%component) normal to cross-section vertex v E M H is obtained by averaging over the normals to the polygons of M H which touch U. Since v occurs on some edge of M, procedure tned is employed to visit each tetrahedron incident to the edge. Each such tetrahedron yields a cross-section polygon which touches U , whose normal contributes to the averaged normal a tU. Having obtained normals to the vertices of a cross-section polygon of M H , brightness values are calculated by Lambert's cosine law, and Gouraud shading used to shade the polygon. The hue of any point p E M H indicates the angle formed between the (Pcomponent) normal to manifold M (at p) and the (4component) normal to H. We call this the orientation angle of M with respect to H.To compute hues, we pre-compute the hue a t each manifold vertex v E M. This pre-processing step is done by averaging over the normals to all tetrahedra of M that touch U , then computing the angle between the averaged normal and the normal t o H. (Here we assume all tetrahedra of M are say right-handed, so that all normals point "outward.") Later, to compute the (#-component) normal to cross-section vertex v' E M H , we interpolate between the hues stored at the endpoints of the manifold edge on which U' lies. Having obtained hues at the vertices of a cross-section polygon, the polygon may be Gouraud shaded.As H is translated in the direction of its normal, crosssection M H changes slowly in regions where the orienta-tion angle is approximately r/2, and rapidly where the orientation angle is close t o 0 or to A. M H is contracting upon itself in regions where the orientation angle is close to 0, and expanding where the orientation angle is close to K. Hue suggests behavior of the manifold beyond and beneath the current position of the cutting hyperplane.For instance, in highly contractive regions of M H , the manifold contracts onto itself "just beyond" the current hyperplane. Furthermore, change in hue indicates curvature of the manifold. In regions of M H where hue</figDesc></figure>

The Wein- garten map L, : T, + Tp is a linear map defined whereU E R3 is a velocity vector located at p . Here N = ( N I , N 2 , . . . , N,) is the normal to q5 corresponding to p , and v N i is the gradient to N i = N i ( p ) . Lp(v) measures the rate of change of normal N as one passes through p with velocity U. Counting multiplicities, there are three eigenvalues of Lp, which correspond to the prin- cipal curvatures of q5 a t p .of 4 a t p , and serves as our sample value at p .
