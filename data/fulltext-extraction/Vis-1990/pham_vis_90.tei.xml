<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Colors are often used for displaying variables in statistical maps to facilitate communication and data analysis. The choice of colors influences the kind of information maps can reveal and hence can enhance the understanding of data or cause confusion and misinterpretation. Some experimental work has been carried out in an attempt to understand how people perceive quantitative information from color displays and to establish principles for constructing effective color schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">13]</ref>. According to Wainer and Francolini <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>, univariate maps should reveal quantitative information, local and global distribution of a variable. For bivariate maps, the association between two variables and the correlation between the two distributions are also important. Trumbo <ref type="bibr">[ l l ]</ref> suggested that a good color scheme should preserve both the order and separation of a variable. For the bivariate case, it is also desirable for the scheme to display clearly the positive association of two variables and not to allow the univariate information to obscure each other. Ware <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[13]</ref> classified information extracted from univariate maps into two cateeories: metric and form. Metric information conveys quantitative value at each point and form information conveys the shape or structure of data. Some examples of form data are local maxima, valleys, cusps, saddles and ridges. His experiments were designed to identify the kinds of color sequences which are good at conveying form or metric information, and at minimizing the effects caused by simultaneous contrast. Simultaneous contrast occurs when the perception of the color of an area is changed by the colors of adjacent areas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Robertson and O'Callaghan</head><p>] discussed various techniques for generating color sequences for univariate and bivariate maps using a perceptually uniform color space. They applied Trumbo's principles for choosing the scheme representation and evaluated the representation by using the levels of comprehension of maps specified by Wainer and Francolini. All these color schemes have relatively simple geometric representation.</p><p>In many situations, quantitative information is not the only important issue for interpretation of data. It is often desirable to emphasize certain characteristics of data in a particular map. For example, to make a sharp change in data at some position more salient, it would be better to create a sharp perceptual change in color elements locally. In other cases, aesthetics or convention might dictate the choice of certain color elements. Hence, it is necessary to have interactive facility for modifying color elements locally to bring out the required features for a particular map.</p><p>In this paper, we shall introduce an altemative computational model for generating color sequences which is based on B-spline curves and surfaces. The main aim is to break away from simple geometric representation in order to provide more flexibility and control over color selection. This would result in facilitating the task of constructing a customized color scheme for a particular map. Section 2 gives brief description of existing color schemes and their characteristics. Section 3 provides some background for Bspline curves and surfaces. Section 4 deals with spline-based methods for generating color sequences for univariate and bivariate maps. Three methods for constructing color sequences for mvariate maps will be described in section 5. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Curves in HSL</head><p>It is an accepted view that a color sequence with monotonic increase in illuminance is better at conveying order whereas a sequence which cycles through a range of hues achieves wider separation in values of a variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr">11]</ref>. It is also desirable for a color sequence not to vary monotonically in any of the three opponent channels in order to reduce simultaneous contrast [ 131. For bivariate color schemes, univariate axes need to be independent so that the component variables do not obscure each other. The principal diagonal of a scheme must form a visually distinct class from other scheme colors, in order to convey the association between two variables <ref type="bibr">[ll]</ref>. Most existing color schemes aim to satisfy some of these principles for making effective use of color for data representation while keeping the computational model simple. Characteristics color differences are not perceptually regular, no explicit control over lightness regular increment in saturation and lightness, irregular spacing in hue wider hue range, two non-adjacent colors near the primaries can appear very close due to pointed shape of color gamut at the primaries wider hue range, increasing separation, order is less obvious</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Univariate sequences</head><p>The simplest representation of a color scheme for univariate maps is a a straight line or straight line segments with color elements regularly spaced in a color space such as the RGB, HSL, or uniform color space (UCS). While the RGB space is useful for display devices, the HSL space is more suitable for color specification as human perception of color can be more intuitively expressed in terms of hue, saturation and lightness. The uniform color space, on the other hand, has the advantage of realizing perceptual differences in colors in terms of Euclidean distances. Details on different color spaces may be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">14]</ref>. Curves and spirals in HSL space which cycle through hues and with increasing lightness and saturation are also used <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr">10]</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes some color schemes and their characteristics. More details on these schemes may be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr">10,</ref><ref type="bibr">11</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bivariate sequences</head><p>The most simple bivariate representation uses a plane or a surface which is constant along a perceptual variable hue, saturation, or lightness. Other schemes relax these constraints to achieve a balance between using a wider hue range for conveying separation and increasing lightness for conveying order <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr">11]</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> gives a summary of some bivariate color schemes and their characteristics.</p><p>Cubic B-spline Curves and Surfaces B-splines provide a very popular mathematical representation for curves and surfaces in computer graphics as they allow a user the flexibility of modifying interactively the shape of a curve or a surface using a small number of control points. Detailed information on B-spline curves and surfaces can be found in many references (e.g. <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>, [SI). De Boor <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> gave a very efficient algorithm for computing points on a polynomial B-spline for a specified set of n control vertices. In general, the control vertices are off the curve and it is not an easy task to locate their exact positions in order to obtain a specific curve. To overcome this problem, Yamaguchi <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[15]</ref> introduced an inversion algorithm for finding the control vertices from a set of knots lying on the curve <ref type="figure">(Fig.2)</ref>. The knots are in fact the endpoints of the curve segments. This method which is based on a Gauss-Seidel iterative process is stable and converges very quickly. Once the control vertices are found, points on the curve can be generated by applying De Boor's algorithm.   To represent a B-spline surface, a (m+l)*(n+l) grid of control vertices is used <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig.3)</ref>. Schaffner <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref> derived an algorithm for computing a grid of control vertices from a given grid of knots lying on the surface to be generated. His method uses digital filters and is very efficient. De Boor's algorithm can also be used for obtaining other points on the surface once the grid of control vertices are known.</p><p>The most useful feature of B-splines for curve and surface design is that whenever a knot and subsequently its corresponding control vertex is changed, a B-spline curve or surface only changes in a local region around that knot while other parts of the curve or surface remain the same. Thus the designing task can be achieved by firstly obtaining the overall shape of the curve or surface, then modifying specific knots to get more detailed form locally. This feature will be exploited for constructing and manipulating color schemes.</p><p>Spline-based Color Sequences for Univariate and Bivariate</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mapping</head><p>All existing color schemes rely on computational models which have relatively simple geometric representation in order to simplify the computation involved. They are certainly not the only models which can satisfy some of the fundamental principles for effective mapping described in section 2. One common drawback of these models is that their simple representation constrains color elements in a sequence to a restricted range dictated by the chosen path or surface, and not by any perceptual or other reason. It would be useful, therefore, if a technique could be found for constructing a less restricted geometric representation which still satisfied some of the mentioned principles and yet allowed some flexibility for modification of particular elements in the color sequence.</p><p>As cubic B-splines provide much flexibility for manipulation of the shape of curves and surfaces, it is not unreasonable to expect that they will provide similar flexibility for color representation and manipulation in some color spaces which realize close relationships between perceptual differences and Euclidean distances. The main idea is to generate a color sequence from a set of chosen key colors by fitting a cubic B-spline curve or surface through the key colors.</p><p>As the HSL color model relates directly to human intuitive understanding of colors in terms of hue, saturation and lightness, it is more appropriate to specify key colors in this color space. The uniform color space is used for computing elements in the sequence as Euclidean distances in this space closely approximate perceptual distances. This property allows regular representation of numerical data by regular changes in perceived color.</p><p>The key colors are firstly converted from the HSL space to uniform color space, and used as knots for a 3D cubic Bspline curve. Yamaguchi's algorithm is then applied to find the corresponding control vertices. Color elements are generated as points on the cubic B-spline curve defined by these control vertices. The number of color elements obtained depends on the chosen parametric step size. Plate l(a) shows a color sequence derived from a straight line in the uniform color space starting from a shade of blue and ending at a shade of yellow. Plate l(b)-(d) display examples of three color sequences generated by a cubic spline using a set of six key colors, where the f i i t and last colors are the same as those in sequence (a). The fourth key color is different in each case, whereas the remaining colors are the same. Hence the differences in the three color sequences only occur at the sixth, seventh and eighth colors. Sequence (c) gives better separation than sequence (b) while sequence (d) gives a totally different shade which can be used for highlighting certain range of data. This highlighting effect is also present in adjacent color elements although to a much lesser extent.</p><p>It might be desirable sometimes to emphasize a range of data by stretching the perceptual distance locally while reducing the distance in other parts. This effect can be easily achieved by moving the knots in that range further apart. Experiments carried out by Ware <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[13]</ref> c o m f i i the theory that a color sequence which approximates the physical spectrum is better at conveying order (or value information) because the effects of simultaneous contrast. On the other hand, a grey color sequence is better at conveying form information. In some cases, it might be useful to be able to emphasize order information in a certain range of data, while bringing out form information within another range. By specifying suitable key colors at appropriate positions, both effects can be achieved for the same color sequence. Thus the spline technique makes it easier to introduce more variation in hue, saturation and lightness to a sequence and to adjust individual key colors in order to enhance the separation or to achieve other effects. This advantage would be felt more strongly in the case of a longer sequence being generated from a small set of key colors, when a user is already satisfied with a large portion of the sequence and only wants to change a few particular color elements.</p><p>For the bivariate mapping, color schemes may be generated by using a bi-cubic B-spline surface. A grid of key colors are firstly specified in the HSL space before being converted to the uniform color space. They are then used as input to Schaffner's algorithm to obtain a set of control vertices from which a bicubic B-spline surface can be fitted. In this color scheme, the two axes are 3D B-spline curves which can be directly specified and manipulated <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig.4)</ref>. Thus this scheme which can be seen as a generalisation of other existing</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Color Schemes for Trivariate Mapping</head><p>The most simple mvariate scheme can be constructed by extending the cylindrical bivariate scheme to a volume which is a portion of a cylindrical ring <ref type="figure">(Fig.5</ref>).</p><p>The three axes are perceptual axeshue, saturation and lightnessand the cross-sections are of constant hue, constant saturation or constant lightness. Among these three types of cross-sections, those of constant saturation have the least restricted range of colors and can best convey order and separation, while those of constant lightness have least separation. Plate 3 displays an example of four crosssections of this type, where the hue varies from cyan to magenta.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">b L</head><p>bivariate schemes, provides more freedom in selecting colors, and yet still can accommodate some of the principles for effective mapping if they are required. For example, if the two axes are chosen as two spline curves which cycle <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig.6</ref>). through a range of hues and increase monotonically in lightness, the scheme would convey separation and order. The key colors can also be chosen in such a way that allows the scheme to display clearly the positive association of two variables (e.g. diagonal elements are of a certain hue), or to split the data into two distinct classes (e.g. cool and warm colors). Plate 2(a)(b) show examples of two color schemes of the latter type at low and high saturation respectively. Another variation is the scheme in Plate 2(c) which is a mixture of cool colors at low saturation and warm colors at high saturation. This scheme separates the data on either side of the diagonal more clearly than the previous two schemes. All these color schemes are generated from a grid of 4*4 key colors. By changing one key color in the top left hand region to a lighter shade of cyan, the data range corresponding to this area is made more salient (see Plate</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">2(d)).</formula><p>The double cone model in the bivariate case can also be extended to a mvariate scheme which is represented by a volume bounded by sections of two double cone surfaces The saturation axis is also used as the third axis as in the case of the cylindrical ring model. Plate 4 shows an example of four cross-sections with decreasing saturation and with hue ranging from a shade of green to a shade of red. This model provides cross-sections along the first two axes which have more separation than those cross-sections of the cylindrical ring model as they involve more variation in hue, saturation and lightness. However, it has a problem that the colors at the two apexes of the double cone are very close together. The third mvariate model that we construct is an extension of the spline-based bivariate scheme. The model is represented as a volume which is bounded by two bi-cubic B-spline surfaces which are generated from two grid of key colors <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig.6</ref>). <ref type="figure">Fig.7</ref>. A spline-based trivariate model. The key colors for each boundary surface are specified in the HSL space, and converted to the uniform color space as before. They are then used to compute the control vertices for two bi-cubic B-spline surfaces which pass through the key colors. To avoid the need to specify the knots for inbetween cross-sections individually, they can be generated initially by linear interpolating between knots of the two boundary surfaces. The color elements for cross-sections are then generated in a similar way to those of two boundary surfaces. If they are not satisfactory, the knots for in-between cross-sections can be altered individually to match specific requirements of a user. Once the cross-sections along one direction are obtained, color elements for cross-sections in two other directions can be readily obtained by grouping appropriate color elements in the first set of cross-sections.</p><p>Instead of generating color elements for cross-sections of this mvaxiate scheme from two randomly chosen boundary surfaces as an example, we select two sets of 4*4 key colors from the first and last cross-sections in Plate 4. The intention is to manipulate these key colors slightly so that the color elements in different cross-sections resulted from the spline-based trivariate scheme have more separation near the origin and near the top right hand comer. The results displayed in Plate 5(a)-(d) show the four cross-sections generated by the spline-based mvariate model. The improvement over the double cone trivariate model is most noticeable at the low left hand and top right hand comers and along the right hand side in (c) and (d).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We have described three models for generating color sequences for univariate, bivariate and mvariate mapping, which are based on cubic B-spline curves and surfaces. Similar models based on quadratic B-splines can also be constructed using techniques described in [SI. These models can be seen as geometric extensions of existing models and can be computed efficiently. They also provide more flexibility for interactive modification of key colors to obtain customized color schemes for individual maps to bring out their special features.</p><p>One possible useful application of the spline-based models is in the device modeling process which attempts to relate addressing coordinates of a display device to perceptual coordinates. In this case, key colors are first generated within a device addressing space, and the possible range of colors that can be produced by a display device is then computed. Thus, it is feasible to represent the color gamuts of a display device by either B-spline curves (paths or cross-sections) or B-spline surfaces.</p><p>It would be interesting to investigate the implications of the spline-based models in perceptual terms, e.g. do some spline paths have closer association with perceptual changes and how to choose a good path for a given set of key colors? These questions must be answered if these models are to be used to their full potential.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>0 Fig. 2 .</head><label>02</label><figDesc>.(a) a square of constant hue; (b) a portion of a cylindrical surface; (c) a section of a double v =P 0 A cubic B-spline curve with knots Pi and control vertices Vi.vertices Vi j.</figDesc></figure>
