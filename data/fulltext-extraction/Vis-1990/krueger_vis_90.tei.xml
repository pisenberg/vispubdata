				<p>This paper describes a visualization model for 30 scalar data fields based on linear transport theory. The concept of &quot;virtual&quot; particles for the extraction of information from data fields is introduced. The role of merent types of interaction of the data field with those particles such as absorption, scattering, source and color sh@ are discussed and demonstrated. Special attention is given to possible tools for the enhancement of interesting data features. Random texturing can provide visual insights as to the magnitude and distribution of deviations of related data fields, e.g., originating from analytic models and m e m m e n t s , or in the noise content of a given data field. Hidden symmetries of a data set can often be identified visually by allowing it to interact with a preselected beam of &apos;)dysical&quot; particles with the attendant appearance of characteristic structural effects such as channeling.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Scientiiic measurements or model simulations typically create a huge amount of field values on a set of discrete space points. Storing this information as large amounts of printed output or tapes often impedes a quick evaluation of the results and an estimate of their scientific value. In order to overcome this obvious bottleneck, tools for the (interactive) visualization of such data fields have been developed over the last few years (see the general discussion of this problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>). Success in the application of such tools has been demonstrated in fields such as astrophysics, meteorology, geophysics, fluid dynamics, and medicine. Generally, in all visualization tools suitable to scientific applications there is a trend to incorporate results and methods from "neighboring" areas such as pattem recognition, p i c m pessing, computer vision, theory of perception, scattering theory, and remote sensing.</p><p>The aim of this paper is to develop special tools for the visualization of 3D scalar data fields originating from scientific measurements or model simulations by supercomputers. The approach will be based on the linear transport theory for the transfer of particles in inhomogeneous amorphous media. The advantages of this model CH2913-2/90/0000/02731$01 .OO -1990 IEEE are its rigorous mathematical formulation, the applicability to data sets originating from different fields such as molecular dynamics, meteorology and astrophysics, and a wide variety of possible mappings of data features onto the model parameters. But, visualization based on this model is very time-consuming, especially in cases where nontrivial scattering processes are considered. It can be shown that almost all volume rendering techniques, more or less dedicated to the problem of intemtivity, are covered by certain mappings and approximations of this model. A discussion of relevant volume visualization models can be found in [6].</p><p>The discussion of the volume rendering model propsed in the paper divides into the following main parts:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">8 8 8</formula><p>Inttoduction of the concept of "virtual" particles interacting with the data field By this one is to imagine probing the data set, considered as a 3D abstract object, with a beam of fictitious particles whose properties and laws of interaction with the data set are chosen at the discretion of and for ease of interpretation of the user. Information about the data set is visually extracted from the pattem on the screen of these "scattered" virtual particles. Classical transport theory provides the quantitative framework in which this concept of "virtual" particles can be systematically developed and exploited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development of a mathematical-physical framework to</head><p>guarantee flexibility in the rendering process for a broad variety of data sets orginating in widely diverse fields.</p><p>It is desirable to have as many conveniently tunable parameten as possible built directly into the algorithm. Classical linear transport theory with its scattering cross sections, absorption coefficients, internal and external source terms and energy shift terms is a familiar formalism whose results are easily interpreted after a minimal amount of "working in" orientation.</p><p>Additional improvements such as texture rendering can be used to probe fluctuations in the data set or to enhance deviations of two related sets. "Interference" pattems visible among scattered artificial particles can be used to identify periodicities and similar hidden symmetries or to indicate the localization of "hot spots" of the probed data field.</p><p>The applicability of results and methods of transport theary in the field of computer graphics is well-known. Enhanced ray tracing algorithms <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>, rendering tools for volumetric effects such as haze or clouds 11, 11, 151 and radiosity methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> exploit these methods.</p><p>In the next section a brief introduction to an appropriate form of the basic equation of transport theory is given.</p><p>An overview of the numerical computation routines is Outlined in the Appendix.</p><p>In the following section the mapping routine8 of special data features onto the parameter fields of transport theory are explained. The "physical" action of these visualization parameters is documented with test pictures.</p><p>The last section is dedicated to tools which can enhance the perception of data field features. Random texturing is introdud as a tool for comparison of data fields originating from different sources, e.g., analytic solutions and results of experiments, or for visualizing the noise content of a data set Hidden symmetries in a large (noisy) data field are visualized with the aid of interacting "virtual' particles which can show characteristic "channeling" effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Basic technique for volume rendering:</head><p>The transport theory model The visualization model considered follows the concept of extracting the essential content of a 3D data field by "virtual" particles passing the field. The concept of "vir"' particles generalizes the models for tracing light rays in complex environments used for computer graphics applications, where the interdon of the light with the objects is governed by optical laws.</p><p>The fundamental quantity in transport theory is the intensity Z(x,s; E) describing the number of particles at a point x which move into direction s with energy ("color") E. In the discrete color space the intensity is given by the averaged v a l w li(x, s) with i = R, G, B.</p><p>The mdering technique proposed is based on an evaluation of the linear transport equation described in many textbooks (see e.g., [2, 3, 5, 141). The basic equation of stationary transport theory is the linear Bolmann equation describing the gains and losses of the particle intensity in a volume element A form suitable for the visualization of 3D data fields is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(S D) * I(x,s; E) = -u~(x; E) * I(x, S; E) + q(x, S; E) (1) a m , S; E) - * aE + u,(x; E) . 1 dw' As' + s) . I(x, s'; E )</formula><p>where D is the gradient operator such that (s. D) = &amp; with the distance variable R and dw is the solid angle around the direction s of the path.</p><p>The relevant parameter fields for the visualization process are the extinction coefficient ut = U, + U, where U, , U, are the absorption and total scattering coefficients respectively, the source term q and the stopping power Si , which reflects inelastic c'color" shifting) interactions. The function p(s' -+ s) is the normalized scattering phase which accounts for changes in the direction of the particle beam.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mapping of data features onto visualization parameters</head><p>Important requests from the user's side on 3D visualization tools are convincing rules for the mapping of interesting data features onto the visualization parameters and "physically" meaningful actions of those parameters during the rendering process. Scientific visualization must produce well-defined pictures.</p><p>An advantage of the transport theory model proposed is that many different possibilities for synthesizing such a mapping suggest themselves. It can easily be demonstrated that all source-attenuation models in volume rendering (see e.g., Volume densities can be mapped onto a volume source term g,, in the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(5)</formula><p>where the coefficient cv &gt; 0 may depend on the "color" E. This mapping is only useful for the visualization of the spatial shape and decay of the data field. This approach was used to visualize the appearance of atmospheric data</p><p>[21] and of the electron density of highly exited atoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. The evaluation of equation <ref type="formula">2</ref> example of the action of this visualization tool is given in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> where the field outside the isosurface is rendered by using the mapping (5) only. The appearance is similar to that of pictures from emission tomography or fluorescent matelidS.</p><p>To visualize isovalue surfaces of volume densities or swng discontinuities along surfaces in volume densities (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr">211)</ref>  This method is especially popular in medical applications where an enhancement of boundaries between different tissue materials (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr">231)</ref> is desired. Examples for the appearance of an isovalue surface are given in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4 and 5,</ref> showing the role of the Lambertian factor (s-e,) for the enhancement of depth formation. This mapping gives enhanced depth information and is also useful for the visualhation of details (see also <ref type="figure">Fig. 6 and 7 )</ref> . Point-like source terms q p or line-like source terms qL can be considered as special cases of the volume source term <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref>. Generally, "hot spots" in volume densities or interesting hyper-surfaces should be visualized with the mappings (5) or (6). The mapping (6) is equivalent to the "diffuse" reflection term used in computer graphics which accounts for the description of light reflection from "very" rough surfaces, for example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b) Absorption term</head><p>The extinction term in the transport equation (1) causes an exponential attenuation of the intensity in (2) via the optical depth. Identifying the absolute value of the field or of the field gradient with uo in the form one gets visualization effects similar to x-ray pictures. An example for the influence of the absorption term on a nonzero initial intensity I, is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. In addition, <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> also shows the attenuation of a surface source visualized with the mapping (6) and high-lighted by using a "specular" component in mapping (10).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>c) Scattering terms</head><p>Exploiting also the more "sophisticated" scattering term U, in the transport theory leads to more elaborate computation algorithms, e.g.. the Monte, Carlo method (see path 2 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>in the Appendix and equation (A2)).</head><p>This term should be incorporated in two different cases: </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Selective</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(IO)</head><p>The phase function PBpec defines the shininess of the surface if a Phong-like smoothing of the &amp;function around the specular direction ssPw is chosen. The location of the specular reflecting parts on the surface can be artifidly chosen by introducing additional external sources. The role of the specular reflection for the enhancement of the depth information is demonstrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5-7</ref>.  <ref type="figure">(10)</ref>. The visualizatton of the iso-surfaces underlines in this example the spatiat decay of the interatomic potential.</p><p>Almost all volume rendering tools use a combination of the mappings <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(51, (61, (9-11)</ref>.</p><p>and Cb.</p></div>

In these cases the coloration is an essential tool (see e.g., PI).</p><p>In general, all parameter fields C (x; E ) in equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>depend on the space coordinates x and on the energy parameter E ~colu"). Using the decomposition</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(12)</head><p>one gets two parallel mapping rules for data field features. <ref type="figure">Figures 4-6</ref> have been rendered with this simple method to enhance the diffexent appearance of volume and surface sources.</p><p>Another approach to use color for feature enhancement can be introduced by incorporating the more "physical" stopping power term in equation <ref type="formula">1</ref> Iden-g Sin(x) with the data field the energy ("color") will be shifted up or down locally, depending on the sign of the field value. <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref> shows a visualization example for such 3D fields by using (14) in addition to volume and surface source terms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tools for enhancement of critical features</head><p>All of thm tools for visualization of 3D scalar data fields are "classic" ones when considered under the aspect of the transport theory model. Recognizing the applications of the transport theory in so many areas additional tools for enhancing special (hidden) features of data fields might be overtaken in an appropriate form. a) Role of texture -"quality" of data An essential part of the interpretation process in science is the comparison of related data fields. For instance, models for the representation of complementary data fields use the composition of visualization tools as surface topography, coloration, and transparency effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Another These statistical parameters am mapped onto corresponding parameters of the particle intensity I via the linear transport equation. Equation <ref type="formula">2</ref>generates the propagatian of field deviations along the particle ray in the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref> where H and N depend on the deviations of the parameters of the transport theory according to the mappings chosen.</p><p>The role of random texture for the comparison of data fields on hypemufaces can easily be demonstrated. Assuming the interesting surface will be visualized by a surface source term (6) only the variance of the particle intensity is proportional to the variance of the data field deviations</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">I2(x, s; E ) = H * Il(X, s; E ) + N</formula><p>where Fl, F2 are the data sets on the surface to be compared. The autocorrelation of I has the same form as <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> with appropriately transformed comlation lengths. The constant in (18) should be chosen such that u12 varies from zero to values larger than 10. Then the natural texturing model <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> can be applied where u12 generates more or less strong non-Gaussian intensity fluctuations on the screen. The autocorrelation length influences the size of the random texture patterns such that the granularity depicts the fineness of the underlying mesh space.</p><p>Considering a mapping of the data field onto the volume source tenn according to (5) equation (2) shows the dependence of I on the spatial average of the source deviations Aq(x)(w AF(x)) along the ray path. Assuming the data field F2(x) only deviates significantly on a few grid points from Fl(t) the intensity variance is given by where k counts the deviation points along the path. As long as k is small compared to the number of grid points along the path ui will be different from zero. The texhrre paaem indicating some strong point-like data field deviations is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>.</p><p>The form (15) of the disturbed intensity 12 at the screen also suggests the incorporation of filtering methods into the rendering process to enhance the visual appearance of noisy data fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b) Visualization of symmetry effectschanneling</head><p>In practice, many data fields have to be checked for (hidden) symmetry properties. The effect of channellng of charged particles in crystalline solids <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> can be used to indicate field symmetries by specific patterns appearing on the surface of the data field. This is an example for visualizing data field features by "vir"' particles other than "photons". Assigning to the test particle an "electric" interaction with the field data than it will be scattered by the field and follow the path 2 depicted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> in the Appendix. If there is any symmetry in the data field, e.g., symmetric "strong" scattering centers, then specific directions along "symmetry channels" will be preferred (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 2</ref>). Letting such test particles cross the data field in a form of a pencil beam, a specific pattem will appear on the screen. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 9</ref> shows the "classic" rendering of a volume field and in addition the scattering pattem of lo00 "charged" test particles caused by cubic-like symmetry properties of the data field. The advantage of this method is that certain channeling effects occur even in the case of a disturbed symmetry.</p><p>Appendix: Evaluation of the transport equation The evaluation of the integral form (2) of the linear transport theory can be done by discretization. This procedure describes a piecewise linear transfer of "virtual" particles, incident with an intensity I, along the volume surface on the right, through the volume considered (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>contains all possible couplings of lowest order of parameter fields to the particle intensity I@, s; E).
