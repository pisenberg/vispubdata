			<abstract>
				<p>A methodology for guiding the choice of visual representations of data is presented. The methodology provides objective and directed, rather than ad-hoc, display design facilities. Such facilites can guide interactive visualisation design, generate standard visualisations automatically, and assess the extent to which chosen representations can convey the required information to data analysts. The methodology is based on distinguishing objectively the types of information conveyed by various visual representations and matching these to the intrinsic characteristics of data and to aims for its interpretation. This approach is directed towards developing a stronger theoretical basis for visualisation in scientific computation. The methodology is developed using a natural scene paradigm in which data variables are represented by identifiable properties of realistic scenes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction: the need for a methodology for visualisation</head><p>Visual representations of data aim to exploit effectively the ability of the human visual system to recognise spatial structure and patterns. This can provide the key to critical and comprehensive appreciation of the data, benefitting subsequent analysis, processing or decision-making.</p><p>Many approaches can be used to represent data; different representations can reveal quite different characteristics of the data. Effective and unambiguous interpretation of data characteristics, however, can depend critically on whether their visual representations are chosen appropriately.</p><p>The task of choosing an appropriate representation is compounded if several data variables are to be portrayed or compared for correlations. Present methods of choosing representations are more often than not based on ad-hoc approaches relying on the experience and advice of a "visualisation expert". This is unsatisfactory when one considers the broad range of applications in which visualisation techniques can play a critical role and the small number of "visualisation experts" @I.</p><p>What is needed is a methodology, based on some appropriate "information theory" of visualisation, for choosing data representations to best achieve any set of specific visualisation aims <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref>. Software tools to support visualisation can then be soundly based and used more widely; at present there is a distinct lack of such tools for application and system builders [6].</p><p>The general aims of visualisation techniques have been fairly well established <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">18]</ref>, but the development of methodologies has been limited. Much work on designing data displays has largely consisted of sets of guiding rules which, although valuable, do not constitute a methodology on which automatic display generation methods can be based. Partial methodologies have been developed for the use of colour in choropleth map displays, remotely sensed multispectral displays, and more complex multidimensional displays <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. A logic-based approach to the problem of choosing colour representations has been suggested by <ref type="bibr">Hudson [4]</ref>. This is one of the few serious attempts to establish a formal and systematic methodology to generate display representations for data. Hudson shows how logical functions testing atmbutes of a display (display predicates) can be used for determining whether particular display strategies can satisfy specified requirements on the basis of logical contraction to encompass all data elements within a single predicate corresponding to a single selective attention mechanism.</p><p>To develop a more comprehensive and systematic treatment of how display representations can be chosen and generated a more complete formalism is required. This paper develops a theoretical basis to underpin visualisation and presents the resulting visualisation methodology.</p><p>The aims of visualisation Visualisation techniques attempt to provoke intuitive appreciation of the salient characteristics of a data set. This is achieved by mapping relevant aspects of the data, CH2913-2/90/0000/0114/$01 .OO -1990 IEEE which may or may not be visual in nature, on to visual representations that can be understood easily and intuitively by the observer <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">19]</ref>. Such techniques can be most powerful if they present data in a form which exploits natural and well-developed visual abilities for appreciation of spatial structure. Underlying the concept of visualisation is the idea that an observer can build a mental model, the visual attributes of which represent data attributes in a definable manner. This raises several questions:</p><p>1. What mental models are most effective for carrying various kinds of information?</p><p>2. Which definable and recognisable visual attributes of these models are most useful for conveying specific information either independently or in conjunction with other attributes?</p><p>3. How are chosen mental models most effectively induced in the mind of an observer?</p><p>4. How can guidance on choosing approriate models and their attributes be provided to a human or automated %lay designer?</p><p>The first three questions have long been considered by artists and scientists alike, if not explicitly, then certainly implicitly. One approach is to use models that are clearly and easily understood such as 3D structures or scenes, to represent data variables by the recognisable properties of the objects or scenes, and to induce them in the observer's mind by using graphics scene simulation techniques. This approach is expanded further in this paper, and used as a basis for developing the visualisation methodology.</p><p>We might also consider the approach of buildmg a model which might in itself be less clear or less immediately accessible, though perhaps in its own way be as powerful, possibly in some temporal or cognitive context. Such a strategy might better enhance concentration on, or appreciation of, aspects of the attributes or properties of the model. Indeed, much modern art can only be interpreted in a contextual sense, perhaps historical, perhaps social, or perhaps by awareness of associated disciplines. This form of communication may be just as, or more, powerful, although may be more difficult to effect reliably than approaches based on realism.</p><p>The fourth question introduces a pragmatic element that focuses on taking objective approaches to the first three questions. In this work, we use the concept of the natural scene paradigm as a viable basis for a systematic approach to this fourth question.</p><p>The natural scene paradigm Our visual mechanisms develop to understand the 3D real world in which we live. That world consists largely of surfaces and their coverings: we can glance at a scene and gain an immediate appreciation of its 3D surface structure, what the surface is covered with, and even the condition or state of that surface covering 171. For example, we can look at undulating hills, covered perhaps with forests or agncultural crops, and perceive each of these properties of the scene independently. That is, we can shift our concentration, at will, from observing the undulations of the hills to variations in land cover, and even to forest density or condition, indicated by colour and texture. This ability to shift attention, or reconfigure mentally, from appreciating one physical property of the scene to another is critical in allowing us to assess scene properties either independently or in relation to one another <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11]</ref>.</p><p>This explains why, when we are faced with the task of finding an appropriate visual representation for data variables, representing them by the physical properties of a scene can be successful even if the data variables are originally non-visual in nature. This does not mean that all physical-property, or natural, representations of data variables are bound to be successful. Neither does it mean, as noted earlier, that non-natural representations are invariably bound to be less successful. Rather it suggests that visual mechanisms which are known to be efficient can be exploited in understanding the structure and components, both basic and subtle, of a visual image presented in the form of a synthesised natural scene.</p><p>An example of the effectiveness of natural scene representations can be seen in the widespread use of reliefshaded surfaces to represent scalar variables defined over a 2D field, where the height of the surface represents the scalar value of the variable. Such a representation can be appreciated easily and immediately whereas an alternative depiction, such as a contour map, can take many years of training before its interpretation is intuitive. It is also interesting that the effectiveness of the relief shading is generally not affected by, for example, an overlay of contours to carry the additional information explicity; such phenomena can occur naturally without interfering with the underlying robustness of the visual system's more basic scene-analysing mechanisms. Thus while it may be possible, and even advantageous, to train the visual system to interpret data representations which are initially nonintuitive, it can be much more effective to harness our well developed scene-analysing mechanisms and abilities by choosing representations that can be interpreted intuitively.</p><p>The natural model has also been widely studied resulting in an understanding of many of the perceptual processes involved [2,7,191. There are many possible ways of representing data variables in natural scenes. These depend on the dimensionality of the data, the method of display, and accompanying constraints.</p><p>Given that we have chosen a particular model (the natural scene) to address our fist question, a particular mechanism (identifiable physical properties of natural scenes) to address our second question, and a realisation method (3D computer graphics scene synthesis) to address our third question, we are left with the fourth question: how can we develop a systematic approach to providing guidance on choosing display representations to a human or automated display designer? It should be noted that the approach developed in this paper does not depend on the choices made to address the fist three questions. Rather it provides a basis for the development which could then be applied over a broader range of models, mechanism and realisations.</p><p>This approach, reflected in subsequent sections of this paper. is based on:</p><p>establishing the nature of the data to be displayed and the interpretation aims of the analyst;</p><p>establishing the capability of various visual representations, being components of natural scenes, to convey information about the attributes of data variables;</p><p>choosing an appropriate representation, or set of representations, for the data by matching the representation capability to the interpretation aims.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Types and Interpretation Aims</head><p>Scientific and statistical data sets can involve a wide range of data types with varying dimensionality. Display requirements can involve isolating data anomalies, portraying gradations in the data, or emphasising abrupt variations; very often depicting the spatial nature of correlations between these characteristics in two or more data variables can be important.</p><p>More specifically, with one data variable, the aim can be not only to portray the local and global nature of data variations but also to allow inference of data magnitude at any point in the display. Both the order and the separation of distinct data values or levels should be apparent. With two or more data variables defined over a common region for example, in a spatial sense in choropleth maps and in a more general sense applies to multi-spectral radiance data (from multiple sensors of different spectral response measuring radiation reflected from a common surface). Most generally, however, several data variables can have arbitrary and distinct distributions.</p><p>Subsequent discussion and examples in this work treat scalar variables defined over a 2D field while recognising that many display problems treat single or multiple 1D variables (such as many of the examples in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[18]</ref>) or variables of three and higher dimensionality (for example in geological or meteorological analysis). The underlying methodology developed depends not on the dimensionality but rather on its objective determination; multiple 2D scalar fields provide a demanding display problem widely applicable in geographic and other contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data variables and dimensionality</head><p>A data variable can be treated as lying within a multidimensional space, the dimensions of which can be spatial, spectral, temporal or other nature. Two variables that have identical distributions in (n-1)-dimensional space, but different distributions in n-dimensional space, can be treated as two parameters of the (n-1)-dimensional space.</p><p>Practical examples are R,G,B components of a 2D image (which can be treated as a 2D 3-parameter data set) or a bivariate choropleth map (which can be treated as a 2D 2parameter data set). In general, variables defined over a common spatial region, as is often the case with geographic data, are spatially 2D and may have a number of parameters. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data types</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Interpretation Aims</head><p>The interpretation aims of a data analyst may be focussed and clearly defined but may also often be broader and  Data attributes of interest to an analyst can be represented both for interpretation of each variable independently, and for interpretation of correlations between variables, as shown in the example of table 2 for three variables from the ecological data set.  The attribute before the colon is row-indexed while the attribute after the colon is column indexed; the colon itself can be read as 'in relation to'. Thus the analyst has indicated interest in the amount of rainfall (variable 1) at a point, the species type (variable 2) at a point and its global distribution, and the local and global distribution of the density of the dominant species type (variable 3). Interest in the correlations is indicated as the local rainfall distribution in relation to the species type at a point, global rainfall distribution in relation to global species density distribution and, and the species type at a point in relation to its global density "ibution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visual representations based on a natural paradigm</head><p>Modem displays have the capacity to control interactively the spatial, spectral and temporal presentation of data.</p><p>This allows a wide range of data representations, incorporating structural, colour and other variations in space or time. The fist step to developing a systematic approach to characterising and choosing effective visual representations of data is to look for guidance from our interpretation of the real world.</p><p>A simple real-world surface exhibits two, possibly independent, parameters over the same 2D spatial field: its height structure and its covering structure (e.g. undulating terrain covered by various forests). In practice such parameters are often related in some physical sense (e.g. vegetation growth depends on surface slope and aspect) but they may also be independent. The surface covering structure can in turn exhibit two independent subparameters: its nature or type of material (e.g. conifer/deciduous forest), and the condition of the material (e.g. overall growth condition). Further, the condition may have several sub-parameters, such as its density (e.g. mature trees per unit m a ) or its phase (e.g. annual stage of plant growth), each indicated by aspects of colour and texture. And so on.</p><p>The distinctions between the various parameters and subparameters of the surface covering variable are not necessarily well defined and they may be related by the underlying physical properties of the scene. But it is clear that many properties, and subtle relationships between these properties, can be observed by focussing attention selectively on the physical components of a scene. And this type of mental reconfiguration can be performed rapidly and easily. These are exactly the types of subtle relationship that an analyst very often wishes to extract from related data variables. Providing such paradigms for model building is the essential role of visualisation tools when used in an exploratory context and is thus a critical element in choosing appropriate representations.</p><p>Other more complex effects can also be observed in natural scenes. For example mixed coverings can be detected and the balance between the components, and to some extent independent variations in each, can be appreciated. An example might be soil types and grass types over the same area. Similarly the co-occurrence of, for example, water and grasslands can allow appreciation of the properties of each to some extent. Other factors, such as the presence and speed of wind, can be indicated (for example by ripples in flat water through which grass may protrude). The "wettening" effect on a material, indicated by the suppression of randomly-directed specular reflections by internal reflection in a water film and the resultant darkening of the material, can be detected simultaneously with the colour and texture of the material. Even further, spatial frequency (or spatial scale) of some scene properties can allow independent appreciation of two processes or variables indicated by the same attribute. An example might be 3D structure at low spatial frequency (such as the shape of a stream bed) and at high spatial frequency (such as the sizes of pebbles on the stream bed).</p><p>The natural world thus offers the model of a very rich set of physical properties, often individually constrained, many of which can be evident either independently or in co-Occurrence with others. There is demonstrated potential for exploiting this by simulating scenes in a display and even making use, for example, of the "wetness" or "dryness" of a material to represent an additional binary variable viewed in conjuction with surface covering and structure depictions. These are observed static properties; allowing a temporal variation can make possible or improve perception of further properties and of subtle relationships between such properties. We constrain this work to static displays for the purpose of building a framework into which further degrees of freedom are subsequently brought.</p><p>To exploit this potential source of interrelated representations we must look at each of these basic scene properties in greater detail and determine the type of information it conveys and any accompanying constraints on its interpretation. The earlier-introduced descriptors (nominallordinal; discretelcontinuous), and spatial relationships between variables (sub-paramemcity) can also describe the natural components, or physical properties, of a simple 3D scene. This can be done for basic scene properties (e.g. properties 1-3 in table 3) and for specific cases (e.g. properties 4-6). The tree structure corresponding to this set of properties is shown in figure 2. </p></div>

Variable is reserved to describe a data variable to be displayed; property is reserved to describe a physical property of a 3D scene. Scene properties may thus be used to represent data variables in a dam display. Attribute is the term chosen to describe each of the earlier introduced information measures describing the characteristics of a data variable (point, and local and global hstribution). The extent to which these attributes can also be conveyed by specific properties of a scene, and the analysts requirements for portraying specific attributes of a variable, determines the suitability of chosen representations of data variables by scene properties. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attributes of a set of natural scene properties</head><p>We can also construct a table showing the informative attributes conveyed by each scene property (table 4). The atmbutes indicated in the table will depend on the method of realising, and thus viewing, the scene and in table 4 are shown for an overhead static relief-shaded view. There may also be other, possibly less complete, scope for making evident attributes or correlation between attributes Qf the properties in such a scene.  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Attributes of scene properties that can be appreciated by a human observer either independently (on-diagonal) or in relation to one another (off-diagonal), under a relief-shaded overhead scene representation.  . Thus it becomes apparent that for any chosen 3D realisation of a representation, or for any given field of application and type of data, the table of evident atmbutes will be slightly different.</p><p>Temporal variations, achieved by animation or by using real-time display techniques to portray intersecting surfaces, can often help to clarify information, such as the spatial structure of 3D scenes, that is less apparent in a static representation. But additional quite complex properties can also be portrayed; movements of one material relative to another can depict characteristics of the surface shape that are not otherwise evident. Examples include the interaction of flexible materials with solid objects to depict material stiffness or the intersection of a plane with a surface to depict coastline profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>.</p><p>The underlying assumption behind exploiting scene property representations is that sophisticated scene synthesis tools and sufficient computational resources are available. This is rapidly becoming the case as computer graphics techniques are based increasingly on better illumination and reflectance models and as improved computational hardware and software are developed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Matching visual representations to interpret at ion requirements</head><p>Establishing common measures. and structures to quantify the measures, of interpretation requirements and representation capabilities allows a matching process to correlate the two. The effectiveness of the various scene properties in depicting specific atmbutes of data variables can be Seen from the tree structure of figure 2. Thus the requirements for any display, and the capabilities of display representations for meeting these requirements, can be reduced to an objective form for matching under any given criteria for interpretation.</p><p>In the ecological data set, for example, rainfall can be represented by the height of a surface (depicted by reliefshading, corresponding to local reflected lightness variations), predominant fauna type by the surface material type (depicted by the pigment used to colour the surface, corresponding to the perceived hue), and the predominant fauna density by the condtion of the surface (depicted by the pigment density, corresponding roughly to the saturation of the colour). The utilised portion of the natural scene property tree is shown in bold in figure 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational matching approaches</head><p>To date this work has utilised these structures as an aid to display specification using human operated matching. Computational tree matching techniques can provide a viable framework for automated or complex display generations, particularly if underpinned by a logic-based verification process. The previously mentioned work by Hudson [4] may offer a model for computational treatment of the matching and verification problem. This approach contracts display predicates into a predicate corresponding to a single selective attention mechanism. This selective attention mechanism is the previously discussed condition for independent appreciation of the various properties of a scene and thus of individual data variables represented by scene properties.</p><p>Hudson treats the representation capabilities, and constraints on the use, of various one-place atmbutes of colour. Generalisation to include spatial and temporal aspects of scene representation results in a display task of substantially greater complexity. The extension to twoplace (comparing two data entities), and more generally multi-place, predicates should allow complex task/display matching to be performed in a logically consistent, formalised manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ill-defined or conflicting interpretation aims</head><p>Although it would seem sufficient to base display generation on the interpreter-stated atnibute requirements (in terms of point, local and global interpretation) this may not always be sufficient. Visualisation is often opportunistic; that is, an interpreter will not always have a good idea of exactly which attributes are of principal interest and indeed may often specify conflicting aims. It may also be advantageous to generate initial representations for large quantities of data automatically and quite independently of analyst interaction.</p><p>The problem of ill-defined interpretation aims can be partially addressed by progressing lower in the structure and basing the assessment of which atmbutes are important on the nature of the data variables: whether they are nominal or ordinal, and continuous or discretely-valued. These properties are fundamental and should either be indicated in descriptive information accompanying the data or be extractable from the data by automatic means. Such assessments may be application-specific and could be prespecified or invoked as a set of adaptive defaults.</p><p>There is also substantial scope for requesting interpretation aims that are conflicting or that pose unrealistic demands from an available set of representations. It has become apparent, through interaction with data interpreters, that some form of rule-based guidance, substantiated by sensible choice of defaults and active feedback, for choosing display representations is highly desirable. It is unrealistic to expect analysts to be able or prepared to specify all aspects of their data and its interpretation aims and also be fully aware of the interpretation trade-offs, and subtleties that can be exploited, in even a straightforward representation paradigm such as the natural scene model.</p><p>But results also suggest that relatively little guidance is required to resolve and design a wide range of display problems that would otherwise be almost entirely ad-hoc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical implementation and display composites</head><p>The approach to choosing data representations is thus based on gathering information about the data, and about the analyst's interpretation aims, and then invoking matching techniques and rule-based guidance to generate displays. At An analyst should be able to modify scene properties interactively by changing, for example, the height emphasis of a surface or the chosen colour representation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">this</formula><p>A specified set of display demands may be impossible to meet with a given set of property representations in a single scene. Multiple and composite displays nevertheless offer substantial scope for resolving such demands, at least to a partial extent, as indicated by the following examples. An intersecting set of surfaces, viewed in perspective, can show correlations in local dmibution between, for example, individual surfaces indicating point, local and global amibutes for each variable independently. Some sacrifice in the appreciation of global distribution will result, but appreciation of local distributions will be maintained.</p><p>As suggested earlier, another approach can use natural spatial frequency separations, for example of large scale and small scale features, to convey more than one parameter in a given structure. This might be applicable to portraying error functions of a variable by small modulations of surface height, the lower frequency variations in which represent the variable itself. Many other such techniques can be applied. Also important is knowledge of the discrete or continuous nature of a data variable, and whether its values are inherently ordinal or nominal, to allow these characteristics to be matched by the nature of the scene properties chosen to represent it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary and Conclusions</head><p>In complex displays effective utilisation of the visual system's spatial analysing capabilities can depend on exploiting, and not confounding, its natural interpretation mechanisms. In this work we have explored the natural scene paradigm, in which scene properties that can be appreciated independently and intuitively have been used to represent data variables, in the development of the display design methodology. The work has focussed on showing how a limited, fairly straightforward set of identifiable static scene properties, such as height distribution of a surface or the nature and condition of its covering material, can be utilised to depict the required attributes of a set of interrelated data variables. Tree structures can be used to represent the dimensional and parametric relationships between natural scene properties allowing them to be matched to the corresponding tree structures indicating the same relationships between the variables in a data set. Matching these structures includes matching the specific informative attributes depicted by each scene property, and between scene properties, to the corresponding requirements for the data set variables.</p><p>The natural scene paradigm is based on knowledge of innate or naturally learned visual interpretation mechanisms. Other models may well be appropriate in specific areas of application, but may not necessarily be so pervasive over the general field of data representations. The methodology developed does not depend on specific models or measures, but rather only on the ability to characterise the models used, and draw distinctions between chosen measures. This level of formalism allows the implementation of a systematic approach, based on direct matching of representation capabilities to interpretation aims, to choosing data representations. Underlying the matching process are considerations for simultaneously depicting both independent and correlated information about data variables, and the potential for exploiting the rich set of natural associations (correlations) that are inherent in the interrelationships of the physical properties of natural scenes. This type of systematic approach can contribute in guidmg the choice of data representations for visualisation.</p><p>Full exploitation of this approach in the visualisation of highly complex or multiple data sets will require a more formal underlying basis. A promising way of providing such a basis appears to be the use of predicate logic to resolve composite relationships between interpretation demands and representation capabilities, supported by rulebased approaches to rationalising ill-defined or conflicting demands. Current research leading on from this work is thus in several directions: building the underlying computational framework to realise general displays of sub-dimensional subsets of multidimensional data; introducing rule-based systems to help generate display representations based on analyst-specified priorities and scene comprehension rules; investigating computational tree-structure matching and logic-based approaches to resolving matching problems; and investigating the generic aspects of spatial, spectral and temporal variations in information displays, together with the influence of constraints on their interpretation.</p><p>The problem of guiding visualisation in scientific computing will not be solved with a single system or approach. What is important is that approaches and underlying methodologies developed are progressively based on, or contribute to, a better understanding of visualisation in terms of the information conveyed. Specific techniques will vary but the development of such methodologies is seen as critical if an effective move from ad-hoc to designed display generation is to take place. This is necessary if serious scientific computation is to benefit from the emerging opportunites in the use of visual computing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>(</head><label></label><figDesc>often spatial) it becomes important to depict not only the actual values of each variable but also the correlations (both positive and negative) in their values and in their local and global distributions.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>A data variable can be either nominal or ordinal. Ordinal data carries an intrinsic progressive relationship between successive values while in nominal data the individual values may not be related in an ordered sense but rather represent (nominal) classification. An ordinal variable may be continuous or discretely-valued, while a nominal variable may be single-valued or multi-valued. Thus, for example, a variable indicating the rainfall over a geographic area might be an ordinal and continuous variable defined over a 2D spatial field; a variable indicating the predominant fauna species (kangaroo, koala, dingo, etc.) found in delineated regions of the area might be a nominal, multi-valued variable defined over the Same 2D spatial field; a variable indicating the density of Occurrence of the dominant species in the same regions of the area (number of kangaroos per unit area, etc.) might be ordinal and continuous and have spatially delineating boundaries over the spatial field in common with the species type variable. Other relevant data variables might also include a nominal, multi-valued variable indicating predominant vegetation type (flora) over the same 2D spatial field, an ordinal, continuous variable indicating total fauna density, including all fauna species, and so on.The data set would thus consist of five variables defined over a common 2D spatial field, with two of the variables being parameters of a given delineation over that field. The structure of this set is illustrated in tree form infigure 1, where the dimensionality is treated independently of what we may term the paramemcity. Thus we term the rainfall, the predominant fauna, the predominant flora, and the total fauna density as parameters, and the type and density of the predominant fauna as sub-parameters of the predominant fauna parameter.

Ask the analyst about the important attributes for interpretation: for individual data variables (point, local, global); for correlations between them (point, local, global relative to each other amibute for each variable); of their relative importances (i.e. priority ordering or weighting of these amibutes); establish analyst-specified constraints (e.g. forcing particular represenmions). Match the representations to the interpretation aims: choose (and display) representations optimising the match, based on smct analyst-specified priorities and constraints; optimising the match on a broader basis; choose (and display) alternative representations indicate which interpretation aims are satisfied; allow interactive change of priorities and *lay regeneration.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Different visual representations can convey different types of information about a data variable and its distribution. The development of a systematic approach to choosing data representations depends on establishing objective measures of the capability of a representation to convey information. This work has proposed and evaluated a practical set of informative attributes, or measures: (1) the data values at any point; (2) the local distribution of the data values around a point; (3) the global distribution of the data values. Display design then requires that an analyst formulate the interpretation aims in terms of these same measures to allow compatible representations to be chosen.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>context-specific. Even context-specific aims should nevertheless be reducible, ideally by the analyst, to a set of more generic characteristics. In fact performing such an exercise can be quite valuable for focussing the interpretation aims.This raises the question of what constitutes an appropriate set of general characteristics. In this work we isolate a particular set that provides a basis for the development of the methodology without necessarily making any claims for its optimality. These Characteristics are based on perceptual and data interpretation considerations.An initial distinction can be made between actual scalar values of a data variable at a point in its distribution and values at a point assessed in relation to its neighbouring values or its distribution of values. One step further, values relative to those in a local neighbourhood can be distinguished from the more general or global distribution of values. Local distributions are indicative of gradients or small (or partial) features, while global distributions are indicative of trends, overall structure, or objects at a larger scale.This type of distinction is not new in visual perception or indeed in broader human communication contexts. The significance, and exploitation, of the difference between local interpretation and global interpretation (or concentration) is particularly clear, for example in the graphic works of M. C. Escher, the music of J. It may be desirable, for certain types of data or interpretation, to draw finer distinction between, for example, local and global attributes. Features can be identified by gradients or gradient patterns and structure can be determined by the aggregation of features; an additional level might thus incorpomte some better defined concept of feature specific to an application. What is important at this stage, however, is the isolation of specific atmbutes which are sufficiently distinct to avoid confusion between their Scope. between two data variables can also be expressed in these terms. For example the co-ocCurrence of specific values at a point in one variable with steep gradients or specific local distributions (such as circular features) in another variable might be significant.Simple descriptive matrix structures can represent these data properties and interpretation aims. The initial three variables, with corresponding indication of dimensionality and parameteric relationships, from the ecological data set example are shown in table<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> along with the nature of each of the variables.</figDesc><table><row><cell>We thus isolate a set of attributes that describes the general characteristics of a data variable: values at a point @oint); local distribution of values (gradients, features) (local); global distribution of values (trends, structure) (global). i Correlations Variable 1 2D-p 1 ordina1,continuous Variable 2 2D-p2(spl) nomina1,multi-valued Predominant fauna type Variable 3 2D-p2( sp2) ordina1,continuous Predominant fauna density</cell></row></table><note>S.

Thus, for example, a continuous, ordinal variable represented by the height of a 3D surface depicted in shaded-relief will make local and global amibutes evident if the data is spatial-frequency band-limited to a degree corresponding to perceived smoothness. On the other hand high spatial frequencies, resulting in abrupt height changes, will not be evident with a consequent loss of local and global distribution information.A</note></figure>
