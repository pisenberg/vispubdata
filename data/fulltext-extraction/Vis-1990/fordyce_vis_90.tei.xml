			<abstract>
				<p>This project represents a typical problem, that of presenting and gaining deeper understanding of a multi-dimensional system: a mathematical model predicting 20-90 second duration oscillations in breathing. We have utilized custom sofhvare for interactive analysis of a 3 0 model plus Wavefront sofhvare to render translucent images of the 3 0 surjbces. The results show that under conditions of no peripheral chemosensor sensitivity, periodic breathing is predicted to occur with (1) an increase in circulatory transit time between the lungs and brain, (2) the presence of marked &apos;steady state&apos; hypoventilation, andlor (3) an increase in brain bloodjlow rate. Therefore, we conclude that the peripheral chemosensors (carotid bodies) are not essential for the development of periodic breathing.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The physiological system controlling the rate and depth of breathing is thought to be a classic example of a closed-loop feedback regulator maintaining the levels of oxygen (02) and carbon dioxide ( C e ) in arterial blood within the narrow limits consistent with life. This system consists of the lungs, airways, chest wall, breathing muscles, specialized centers in the brain responsible for respiratory muscle activity, body tissues which consume 0 2 and produce C02, and chemosensors which sense the levels of 0 2 and CO2 in arterial blood. Arterial blood is rich in 0 2 since it is blood which has undergone gas exchange in the lungs but has yet to reach metabolizing tissues. It is widely held that this system operates much like a room thermostat; as the temperature in the room falls, the heater is activated and the temp rises. With breathing, the regulated variables are both 0 2 and CO2 while degree of breathing is the "controlling" variable; as the 02 level in arterial blood falls, it is sensed by the chemosensors, neural activity in the respiratory centers increases, breathing increases, and the level of 02 in the blood rises. Conversely, as the CO;! level in arterial blood rises, it is sensed by the chemosensors, neural activity in the respiratory centers increases, breathing increases, and the level of CO2 in the blood falls. The differing polarity of 02 and CO;? controller actions reflect the fact that 0 2 is consumed and CO2 produced by cellular metabolism.</p><p>With the above perspective, the important aspect of breathing is the volume flow rate of fresh gas into the lungs; this is calculated for each breath as the depth (i.e., volume in L) of the breath divided by the duration of the breath (in seconds); this volume flow rate is called minute ventilation ( \ j~) . The (2) there are additional one located in the brain near the respiratory centers, so-called central chemosensors. It is assumed that the peripheral and central chemosensors exert independent and additive effects upon breathing. A block diagram of this control system is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Thus, the negativefeedback respiratory control system has some inherent time delays and wash-in time lags. Theoretically, such a system may maintain steady levels of the controlled variables, but under some conditions, it may show instability and oscillations in \ j~ and the levels of and C a .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Controller plus VP</head><p>Periodic breathing (PB), characterized by repetitive oscillations in minute ventilation of 20 to 90 seconds duration, occurs spontaneously in various circumstances including heart failure, metabolic and neurological disorders, sleep, prematurity, high altitude, and hypoxia <ref type="bibr">[l-31</ref>. An example of PB is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. The accepted view is that PB is due to instability of the entire chemical feedback system controlling breathing with its inherent circulatory time delays. The alternative view is that PB is generated in the central nervous system in spite of the chemical control system. Statement of the Physiological Problem Based upon the premise that PB is the result of the chemical control system, our earlier modeling results [4] indicate that during acclimation to high altitude the peripheral chemosensors are the key destabilizing elements. Thus, one would predict that if the peripheral receptors were surgically eliminated or blunted naturally, PB would no longer occur. Surprisingly, the experimental removal of the peripheral chemosensors in the pony does not eliminate PB [5]. The question is: how can PB occur without the peripheral chemosensors? A closely related practical issue is the design of a series of experiments to address this question. The modeling and visualization described here form the basis for these experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling Methods</head><p>Under the hypothesis that periodic breathing results from instability in the chemical control of breathing, Khoo and coworkers (6) have developed a mathematical model to predict the occurrence of PB in intact humans. This model has three compartments representing the lungs, body tissues, and brain tissue (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) and consists of 5 differential equations and 30 parameters. It includes circulatory transit delays from lungs to peripheral and central chemosensors, mixing in the heart and pulmonary vascular, and both peripheral and central feedback effects upon ventilation. With Khoo's approach, PB (or instability) is predicted for a set of parameter values by transforming the equations into the frequency domain and examining the value of the open loop gain (Lâ‚¬i) which is frequency dependent. This approach stands in contrast to examination of the response in the time domain. Thus, the closed loop nature of the dual feedback control system is "opened" mathematically and the time domain is not strictly considered.</p><p>The technique of "local stability analysis" described by Khoo er al.</p><p>[6] predicts whether or not the respiratory control system is stable in the immediate vicinity of a particular operating point. We have used this procedure with only minor modifications. By restricting the analysis to small regions around specified operating points, the non-linear equations describing the dynamic model may be linearized and solved analytically. By definition, the system is locally stable if and only if it returns to a particular operating state over time after a small disturbance has displaced it away from this original point to some nearby state. This is equivalent to requiring that the open loop gain be less than 1 (see below). A classical theorem in control theory states that if the linearized system is stable in the vicinity of a given operating point, the complete non-linear system is also stable at that same point [6]. The stability properties of the system may be explored by applying this quasi-linearization approach to various operating points. Calculations are made at a particular operating point, and non-linear functions are linearized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition of Loop Gain</head><p>With Khoo's analysis, instability is predicted by subjecting the "open loop system" to small sinusoidal perturbations in ventilation. After this disturbance acts on the lung compartment to alter arterial blood gases, these act, in turn, on the peripheral and central chemosensors to create a small sinusoidal response of the same period, T. Due to the transport delays and time constants of the system, the response lags behind the disturbance by some phase angle. The ratio of the magnitude of the sinusoidal response to the disturbance is termed the open loop gain (LG). For a set of system parameters and a specific cycle duration, the results of local stability analysis is pair of calculated values: the LG and its associated phase lag. Given values for the parameters, the open loop gain is calculated for a set of cycle durations <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref>. The system is unstable (and PB will occur) if the LG at a phase lag of 180' (LG@ 180') is</p><p>LG at 180 deg \ 2.8 1 2.1 1 1.4 <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Typical plot of Loop Gain (LG) versus phase angle for a range of disturbance frequencies as derived by local stability analysis for intact man at high altitude. In this case, LG@ 180' is greater than 1 which indicates that for this set of parameters the system is unstable (and periodic breathing will occur). greater than or equal to 1.0. Conversely, the system is stable if LG@180' is less than 1.0, but higher values of LG@180' (although less than 1.0) may be described as being relatively less stable than lower values. We have not routinely retained individual values of LG and phase angle (as functions of T) in our datasets, rather we have determined LG@ 180' using Newton's method and retain that and the associated period, T.</p><p>Thus, our input parameter space has 25 dimensions while our output is a vector (IS@ 180' and T).</p><p>Previous work for intact humans indicates that certain sets of parameter values lead to predictions of periodic breathing; these predictions are consistent with clinical observations [4, 61. In other words, some parameter sets are associated with PB while others are not. The parameter values published by Khoo er al.</p><p>[6] for normal humans are based on various physical and biological measurements. Khoo's model appears to be an improvement over earlier models in that it predicts periodic breathing under normal physiological conditions with only subtle changes in parameter values; this corresponds to the fact that observations indicate that episodes of periodic breathing appear and disappear in a seemingly spontaneous manner.</p><p>Using this model, Khoo et al.</p><p>[6] investigated a number of situations in man: normals during sleep and during acute exposure to hypoxia, sleeping infants, and patients with cardiovascular or neurological lesions. They found that in almost every case the predicted ventilatory instability was mediated by the peripheral chemosensor drive to breathe.</p><p>In the present work we simulated hypoxic ventilatory blunting by simply eliminating the peripheral chemosensors from the model. In the body, these receptors are completely responsible for the increased ventilation of high altitude (i.e., reduced oxygen levels or hypoxia). Removal of the peripheral receptors only reduced the number of parameters in the model from 30 down to 25. After mathematical elimination of the peripheral chemosensors, there were two questions of interest. First, were there sets of parameters which resulted in PB?</p><p>Second, if there were, which parameters are the most important in that they required the least change from normal to induce PB?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific Conclusions</head><p>Our results show that PB due to the chemical control system can appear in the absence of the CB; these have been presented elsewhere [7]. Basically, certain characteristics of the central ventilatory chemosensor, in combination with the rest of the system, can provide the appropriate degree of negative feedback such that the system becomes unstable. The important characteristics are the lung to central chemosensor time delay, the gain factor and threshold for the central chemosensor CO2 response, and the time constant for the central chemosensor ventilatory response. Experiments have been planned to measure these values in awake ponies after the elimination of the peripheral chemosensors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Viewing Multi-dimensional Data</head><p>A mathematical model such as this one results in multidimensional datasets, with input parameter values lying regularly along orthogonal axes. These datasets are, in general, scalar or vector fields. A common challenge in scientific data visualization is to show the nature of the output field and how the input parameter-space affects this field.</p><p>A most obvious mapping of multiple dimensions of data is to an ideal 3D space, in which three data dimensions are represented by three perpendicular axes (usually X, Y , and 2).</p><p>Coordinates within the space are displayed according to the associated data values (using colors, symbols, iso-surfaces, etc.). In addition, a fourth dimension of the dataset can be mapped along a temporal axis (considered to be perpendicular to the X Y Z cube). This results in an animated change in the 3D space over time. Color can also be used in a variety of ways to represent data from a fifth dimension, which could also be altered through time in terms of another dimension of data, etc. In theory, any number of dimensions of data may be mapped onto any number of geometrical, chromatic, or temporal spaces. The challenge is to craft appropriate combinations of these mappings of raw data in order to channel meaningful information to the investigator and hisher colleagues. We believe an effective visualization is one which allows the researcher to readilv gain new insights about the system under study.</p><p>The history of computer graphics is highlighted by key developments in the search for visual realism. The kinds of problems encountered in scientific visualizations such as the present one are not concemed with problems of visual realism. In this case, the data values do not necessarily represent any aspect of how a model <ref type="bibr">''looks" [8]</ref>. This model is an abstract one, not based upon an anatomical or spatial structureit is more "topological", based on the dynamics of a physiological system, in which certain parameters have been isolated for study. This class of visualization problems is more openended: it poses a different kind of challenge since the forms, colors, and events are used solely for the sake of communicating numerical data. The methods for doing this rely on matters of perception, communication, and the conventions of visual language.</p><p>Before we began imaging his data, the investigator was not clear on how the combinations of parameters were affecting the output variable, Loop Gain. He suspected that the variations would tend to vary rather unevenly within a cube defined by three selected parameters from the simulation. We considered a translucent volume visualization of the entire chunk of data but quickly realized that selecting a few iso-surfaces displaying different values of Loop Gain would suffice. The visualization showed the variance along this dataspace to be relatively laminar and continuous. We decided that this could be adequately communicated using only a few representative surfaces (Loop Gain at 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1, with each surface displayed with a unique color). An illustration of these three surfaces is shown in </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interaction</head><p>We initially developed an interactive animation on the Silicon Graphics IRIS workstation using the IRIS Graphics Library. To begin, we decided it would be useful to interactively rotate the 3D surfaces, so as to gain an initial understanding of the dataspace. Given the speed of our IRIS 3020 (which we did not consider to be fast enough for adequate display of shaded surfaces) we chose to represent the surfaces as dense sets of points arranged so as to give the effect of translucent surfaces.</p><p>Here is a case of compromising rendering sophistication for the sake of effective real-time image interaction [91. By rotating the model to different positions, we could readily see the presence of all the surfaces and their contours.</p><p>The use of interactive rotation and translation helps in getting the grasp of a visual model like this by taking advantage not only of the visual senses but also of the kinesthetic senses. These senses come into play when, for instance, one moves a mouse across the desktop to rotate a 3D model. For this model we put to use some custom algorithms for translating the user's hand motions and button pressings on a mouse to actions on the screen. These were useful in quickly developing the visualization code.</p><p>An initial visualization which is quickly produced and interactive can be useful for a variety of reasons. It allows the investigator to get insights about the model in short order. This is valuable since it not only improves the investigator's science but also hisher confidence in scientific visualization as a valuable tool and in the visualization specialist as an effective member in the research team. Also, the researcher can receive a videotape in a few days suitable for small presentations. This initial effort may be sufficient for some investigators, but it also can set the stage for more sophisticated, production quality renderings down the road.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rendering</head><p>Although this model is not a representation of any physical objects in the visual world, we felt that using computergraphical techniques for visual realism could help in clarifying the nature of the dataspace for presentation of the research at a national meeting. For this we chose a high-end animation system (Wavefront) to script out a set of rotations with the surfaces rendered in a "truer" form of translucency and having a semi-glossy sheen. Iso-surfaces in Wavefront fonnat were produced using the Marching Cubes algorithm <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. The Wavefront animations we produced illustrated a variety of different surfaces and volumes resulting from different parameter combinations. The high quality of the Wavefront renderings reduced the difficulty in interpretation that we encountered in our first animations.</p><p>Our experience with Wavefront confirmed our view that although it produces high-quality graphics, the level of interactive feedback in "communicating" with the data is very slow (i.e., days to weeks), and it does not serve as a good environment for the investigator to explore his dataset. Wavefront, like many high-end rendering and scripting packages, is primarily a production tool, not a data exploration tool.</p><p>We have returned to program development on the IRIS to explore visualizing more dimensions of the data simultaneously. For instance, we have included the mapping of a color field onto a surface to represent the second output variable from the simulation (the period of oscillation). Color has been used not as a classification device (like identifying different levels of Loop Gain), but as a continuous map of a scalar field which varies over the dataspace.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The graphical model and user controls we have developed for this visualization represent a straightforward solution to the problem of comprehending a typical multidimensional dataset encountered in mathematical modeling. Our considerations are primarily those of mapping concurrent data dimensions to appropriate sensory modalities (spatial, chromatic, temporal) for the sake of maximizing the investigator's understanding of the dataspace.</p><p>As a visualization team, we have found that it is useful to pursue two approaches to the visualization process: first, immediate access to interactive graphical manipulation via custom programs or turnkey visualization applications and, second, production of high-quality animations for conference meetings.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Block diagram of the respiratory control system. chemosensors are located in two different areas: (1) a pair are in the neck, known as the peripheral chemosensors;</figDesc></figure>
