By employing computer graphics to enhance the interface between the user and their data, (i.e. allow interactive investigation of data), productivity in research and product development can be greatly increased.

In addition to accepting data from the previous stage in the pipeline, user input/control for each stage is shown to the right of each function block.</p><p>Function-specific output data is also indicated to the right of the particular function block.</p><p>Two types of input files are required: grid geometr (grid file) , which stores the X, Y, f coordinates of the grid points and flow quantities (solution file), which contains the experimental or computational results.</p><p>Access to the input parameters is provided by a graphical user interface, based on MOTIF.</p><p>The user is presented with a series of "panels" that control numeric parameters and program operation via an intuitive "point and clickt1 methodology, making the software easy to learn and operate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">SCALAR AND VECTOR FUNCTIONS</head><p>The Scalar and Vector Functions block reads the input data sets and allows the user to select from a wide variety of field functions that can be applied to the solution data to calculate derived Vorticityll .</p><p>An integral register structure holds the results of the field calculations as three quantities per node point: a scalar value, a vector and a "threshold function". The threshold function may be used as a discriminator: scalar or vector functions will be displayed only where the threshold function is within a range specified by the user. In this way, the user can filter out parts of the display based on the value of a function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">NUMERIC TO GEOMETRIC FILTER</head><p>This functional block is the heart of the visualization process: it is here that the field data is converted into a "graphical paradym" for display. The user defines a set of surfaces, each with its own set of rendering parameters. A arbitrary cutting plane may be positioned interactively within the data field and the system will solve for the scalar and/or vector parameters on that plane. Iso-surfaces are defined by specifying a data value (or in the case of sweeping or animation, a range of values). FIELDVIEW will solve for the polygons required to generate the 3D iso-surface(s).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Both surface</head><p>control panels provide control over the rendering and colormap attributes used to display the results. Some of the rendering attributes that may be controlled are: representation (wireframe, shaded, shaded with light source) , visibility (on/off) , mesh display (on/off), and color. Colormap functions allow the user to interactively select from a list of predefined colormaps, squeeze/stretch the range and load user supplied colormaps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">VIEWING INTERFACE</head><p>The final stage in the Visualization Pipeline is the Viewing Interface. The user can rotate, zoom and move around the field to get a clearer picture of the flow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.0">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>Three problems are used to demonstrate the use of FIELDVIEW in investigating flow data sets:</p><p>Numerical simulations <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref> of hot supersonic exhaust jets produced from three nozzle designs;</p><p>A numerical simulation of the effect of a hot streak in a two-dimensional time-dependent rotor-stator interaction </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">HOT STREAK EXHAUST JETS</head><p>An interesting problem in aircraft applications is that of improving mixing rates of jet exhausts with the external streams.</p><p>This example uses results obtained by Anderson and Barber <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref> in applying their three-dimensional paf-abolic Navier-Stokes procedure to a series of supersonic nozzles. A computational grid of approximately 190,000 grid points was used in the analysis of three configurations: axisymmetric, rectangular and splayed nozzles. analysis is to examine the splayed nozzle for enhanced mixing of exhaust over the other two configurations. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows axial cross sectional planes of total temperature. This type of display can be generated through the explicit selection of the computational plane location, or animated by sweeping the plane through a range. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the 1000 degree Rankin isotherm for each of the three configurations.</p><p>It is clear from ,the visualization that the splayed mixer exhibits a more rapid mix out of hot exhaust gases.</p><p>The objective of the 3.2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HOT STREAK MIRGATION</head><p>In optimizing gas turbine cycle efficiency, it is desirable to achieve high average combuster exit temperatures. Due to the spatial and temporal varations in the exit flow temperatures, allowable metal temperature may be exceeded. Davis (UTRC) has applied a time-dependent, thin-layer Navier-Stokes method developed by Rai <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to study the hot streak migration through a rotor-stator interaction. A configuration consisting of 3 stators and 4 rotors was analyzed with a multi-zone grid of approximately 35,000 node points. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows a single time step in the computation. The low temperature is indicated by the blue color and the high temperature is indicated by the red color.</p><p>The visualization clearly shows a build-up of hot streak on the pressure side of the rotor which leads to degradation of durability because of the high heat transfer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">FUEL INJECTOR</head><p>Experimental data can benefit from interactive analysis as well.</p><p>In this example, laser diffraction velocimetry (LDV) was used to measure the mean velocity flow field behind a Pratt and Whitney fuel injector <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>.</p><p>The objective of the researchers was to understand the recirculation zone, a region in which the fluid in the opposite direction to the main flow.</p><p>Streamlines (or particle path lines) are used to understand this type of phenomena. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows a single view of the injector geometry and the streamlines. The streamlines are constructed by interactively releasing particles from a rake geometry.</p><p>FIELDVIEW calculates the resulting path taken by the particles at discrete time steps. The streamlines are colored to indicate the distance of the release point from the central axis of the injector.</p><p>When animation is used to display the particle motion, the experimentalists observed flow behavior near the boundary of the recirculation region that they were not aware of before.</p><p>In this case, interactive visualization was used to discover new physical phenomenon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.0">CONCLUSION</head><p>Fluid mechanics data sets generated by today's three-dimensional, time-dependent problems often contain billions of pieces of information.</p><p>These data sets may be effectively studied through the use of interactive data visualization to: FIELDVIEW is a software tool that has been created specifically to fulfill these criteria and as such, provides a very useful tool for interactive investigation of fluid mechanics data sets.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>FIGURE 1.
