				<p>Visual Data Analysis (VDA) methods have found application in aerospace engineering research. VDA is being used to develop new non-destructive evaluation testing techniques for graphite epoxy composites by providing new insights into stress waves propagating through them. Visual Data Analysis was used to analyze stress wave propagation, determine the origin of an unexplained wave distortion, and create a theoretical model to eliminate the distortion Urilizing mathematical modeling.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Role of Visual Data Analysis</head><p>Today we are able to generate a significantly greater amount of data than we are able to analyze and from which we can obtain useful information. Typically, the scientific process involves these steps: accessing data; developing hypotheses; designing experiments; developing and implementing algorithms; collecting data; and presenting results. Scientists, engineers and other technical analysts have been searching for innovative ways to shorten the "mean time to discovery" when working with large volumes of data. Today, the ability to unravel information from mountains of data is linked directly to analysts' ability to visualize --to explore and discover -on the basis of what they see.</p><p>The key words in Visual Data Analysis are "interaction" and "immediate." The user must be "in the loop", moving easily between analysis, visualization and interpretation of the data and data subsets. Removing any of these components from the loop slows the exploration and discovery process. Visual interaction with the data is crucial, as evidenced by the case history example that follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NDE Test Methods</head><p>The aerospace industry uses graphitelepoxy fiber-reinforced materials extensively. These materials are used in structures that can exploit their strength, light weight, and high stiffness. In aircraft structural design, the two most critical parameters are stiffhess and strength; because graphitdepoxy composites are lighter and stronger than metal, they are replacing metal in the construction of aircraft, submarine hulls and rocket launchers. In most applications, laminates constructed of many layers of graphite fibers embedded in an epoxy polymer, are required to achieve the desired strength and stiffness. Some parts of the airframe require that all fibers be unidirectionally aligned parallel to the load direction, such as in longerons or spar caps. It is in these unidirectional components that a non-destructive test technique utilizing mathematical modeling is used to measure a change in stiffness for stiffness-critical applications.</p><p>The test detects hidden defects that may have formed during fabrication. Components made of composites are subjected both to ultrasonic nondestructive testing and to actual stress tests. Such testing is costly and time consuming. During the test, two waves are generated by a single acoustic transducer. A quasi-longitudinal (QL) wave propagates in one direction and a quasi-transversal (QT) wave propagates in another. Traditionally, changes in the stress wave speed are used to measure a corresponding change in stiffness, but here the same change in stiffness also changes the Visual Data Analysis (VDA) is an exciting new approach to this discovery process which has evolved from the confluence of substantial computational power on the desktop, sophisticated high-performance vector and raster graphics, and high-level software tools for accessing, analyzing and visualizing large volumes of data.</p><p>Visual Data Analysis techniques permit scientists, researchers and engineers to consolidate these processes, interact with the data, and produce their desired results in significantly less time than the traditional sequential process demands.</p><p>Traditionally, the process of interacting with data has been a time consuming effort that required becoming skillful at a particular compiled language and learning a large number of graphical subroutines. There always will be a need for customized routines,but for many applications, VDA packages can offer useful visual aid tools in a friendly interactive language. They require only a fraction of the time to create visual aids compared with custom approaches.</p></div>

For example, atmospheric moisture could absorb into the epoxy matrix through an exposed pomon of the structure and reduce its stiffness by as much as 30 percent, which would result in a 10 percent shift in the QT wave direction. To measure this shift, multiple transducers are placed in the far boundary where the QT wave reflects.</p><p>Preliminary tests have verified a shift in the QT wave where a rather wide acoustic transducer was slowly moved in small increments within the region of interest. Within the same region, an array of acoustic elements made the same measurements not only faster, but also with better resolution. Improved resolution enabled Dr. Ronald Kriz, of the National Institute of Standards (NIST), in Boulder, Colorado, to observe distortions in the QT wave that were impossible to remove and had no obvious physical origin. The QT wave distortions placed the validity of the test in question because they made it impossible to measure changes in the propagation directions of the QT wave.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test Simulation</head><p>Kriz and his colleagues at NIST set out to determine the origin of the wave distortion. First, they simulated with finite elements the origin of the wave distortion. Second, they simulated with finite elements the propagation of stress waves in a block of graphite/epoxy composite. With a somewhat course finite element mesh, the results indicated that, at best, they could reproduce a necessary mode transition in particle displacements and a flux deviation propagation direction. This method proved inadequate. While they were able to reproduce a mode transition in particle displacements and a flux deviation propagation direction, the physical origin of the distortions remained unknown. At that point, it was difficult to determine whether the distortions were caused by the course finite element mesh used in the simulation. They required a finer mesh size, but found that a refined mesh size would exceed the resources of their vector processor computer.</p><p>They changed to a finite difference technique, used the NIST supercomputer to generate their data, and their results improved. The mesh density was large enough that no distortions in the propagating stress waves were observed.</p><p>Their computation time was significantly reduced.</p><p>Kriz's data simulation process generated a huge amount of datamore than 300 megabytes. Using the fast mathematical modeling techniques created by John Gary of NIST's scientific computing division and Visual Data Analysis software, Kriz was able to view the progression of stress waves moving through the epoxy material from different planes and perspectives. The finite difference model was analyzed with PV-WAVE software operating on a Sun 3 workstation. The magnitude of the stress wave displacement was displayed using a gray scale format with white representing the largest positive displacements, and black showing regions of the largest negative values. This clearly showed the wave periodicity and the direction of wave propagation, however, it did not show the corresponding diffraction components or Rayleigh surface waves.</p><p>Kriz then modeled the diffraction magnitude of a single pulse instead of a continuous sinusoidal vibration. He was able to take advantage of the shaded surface visual aid in order to clearly see both the large gradients in the planar QT and QL bulk waves and the small gradients in the surface wave and diffraction. This method highlighted the interrelationship of planar bulk waves, diffraction, and Rayleigh surface waves. Still, the physical origin of the QT wave distortion remained unknown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Animation</head><p>He turned to animation for the answer. He created a 14frame sequence which predicted the shape and the path of the stress waves. It revealed that the faster moving QL wave reflected from the far boundary, then propagated along the same deviated path, in the process interfering with the slower moving QT wave. This phenomenon had remained hidden in the gray scale plot because the human eye can differentiate a maximum of 30 shades of grey. The shaded surface animation used blue shading which allowed the secondary waves to appear and showed how the waves were reflected back and forth inside the material. Kriz had discovered the physical source of the QT wave distortion. As a result, he was able to detennine that the distortion could be eliminated by launching the QT waves prefmntially.</p><p>Once the physical source of the distortions was determined, a mathematical solution could be suggested. The final animation shows the QL wave reflecting from the boundary of its origin. When the QL wave reflects, all of the energy remains associated with the particle displacements, and no additional QT wave is generated. So by visualizing, he could deduce that waves could be preferentially launched if a transducer was made to vibrate with the same ratio of longitudinal and shear displacements prescribed by the mathematical model. Using this approach, they simulated the propagation of a single QT wave. The idea worked and the next step was to fabricate a transducer with the desired vibration ratio. To date, there is no such transducer, but it is physically possible to cut a Quartz transducer with the</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>Combining vector and raster graphics provides profound insights into various aspects of multi-dimensional datasets.</p><p>In this instance, Kriz could display the vibration angles of the particles as a raster image and drape it over the wireframe representation of the shock wave magnitudes allowing him to easily visualize the relative effect on the material properties of the shock waves. Furthermore, the interaction of the primary and secondary waves in turbulent wakes could readily be observed.</p><p>Albert Einstein said that, "If we trace out what we behold and experience through the language of logic, we are doing science; if we show it in forms whose interrelationships are not accessible to our conscious thought but are intuitively recognized as meaningful, we are doing art." Kriz' stress wave animations allowed him to see the space-time interrelationship of data that were previously unimaginable. Utilizing PV-WAVE, VDA was the vehicle which allowed him to bring together "art," and the "language of logic." Visual Data Analysis played an important role in solving this particular scientific puzzle. There are many other examples of how VDA can be used in conjunction with experimental results and theoretical requirements to solve problems. It can be used in technical applications ranging from high prescribed ratio. energy physics to medical research, astronomy and space Kriz, R.D., "Nondestructive Evaluation of Simulated exploration to process monitoring.
