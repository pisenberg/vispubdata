				<p>This research is an exploratory effort to classify visual representations into homogeneous clusters. Our goal is to determine the type of knowledge conveyed by various visual representations. We collected hierarchical sorting data from twelve subjects. Five principal groups of visual representations emerged from a cluster analysis of sorting data: graphs and tables, maps, diagrams, networks, and icons. Two dimensions appear to distinguish these clusters: the amount of spatial information and cognitive processing effort. Our future research will continue to identify properties that characterize knowledge expressed with visual representations.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Visualization transforms raw data into pictures that people can understand quickly. Tools for visualization are emerging rapidly. The National Computer Graphics Association estimates that $22 billion will be invested in graphics technology this year1. Currently, information technology accounts for fifty percent of the net capital expenditures in the Fortune 5OO2. There was a -1 % per year return on this investment in the 1 9 8 0 '~~. Given this poor prior performance, it is appropriate to reiterate questions raised philosophically by T.S. Eliot: "Where is the wisdom in knowledge? Where is the knowledge in information? "</p><p>The goal of visualization is to extract knowledge from raw data.</p><p>Research in visualization investigates those mechanisms in humans and computers which allow them to perceive, interpret, use, and communicate visual information4. Visualization includes both image understanding and image synthesis. Too often we become so involved in a microcosm of problems related to our current visualization algorithm that we fail to understand how people extract knowledge from data.</p><p>Some visual representations convey certain types of knowledge better than others. Classifying the type of knowledge conveyed by various visual representations avoids the subjective aspects of designing an appropriate visual representation. Classification helps people to make informed decisions about which type of visual representation best conveys different types of knowledge. Our research classifies the type of knowledge conveyed by a visual representation.</p><p>Classification is a fundamental process of science. Classifications identify concepts necessary for a development of theories within a scientific field. All sciences are built upon classifications that structure their domains of inquiry. Our objective for classifying visual representations is fourfold:</p><p>to pnderstand how people organize and process 9 to identify problem areas and anomalies in the to communicate how to convey knowledge to predict future research needs and limitations</p><p>The remaining sections of the paper contain visual information processing issues relevant to our research, methodology and data analyses used to develop our classification system, results of our empirical study, and possible directions for future research. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visual Information Processing Issues</head><p>Visual information processing issues germane to our research are only a small part of the classical study of visual p e r~e p t i o n~-~. The issues in visual representation extend beyond the general visual perception issues.</p><p>Although the perceptual mechanisms are equivalent, the content of the images studied are different. Visual representations contain semantic information that communicate a purpose or graphical message. Artificial and sometimes abstract conventions symbolically encode the message of the visual representation. People decode the visual representation to extract its knowledge. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CH2913-</head><formula xml:id="formula_0">RS = c V. p&gt;</formula><p>where V is the visual representation of the real world, and P is a set of processes that interprets V.</p><p>Visual representations carry no meaning without the decoding processes that interpret the visual representation. People must have rules to interpret features of visual representations. Our research classifies these features of visual information that people use to interpret visual representations.</p><p>Sorting procedures provide a useful method for creating a classification. Sorting provides data that can be analyzed using many multivariate statistical procedures, including factor analysis, clustering, and multidimensional scaling. Sorting can reveal structure if the information is hierarchical. Hierarchical information storage is a classic principle of categorization research9-lo. We assume that people store visual knowledge hierarchically.</p><p>Our empirical sorting task allows us to examine this structure. Our goal is to identify major clusters of visual representations and determine properties that uniquely distinguish each cluster.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Three broad methodological challenges must be overcome to create a classification of visual representations. First, the sample of visual representations used to create a taxonomy must be a representative subset of all visual representations within the scope of the taxonomy. Second, the sample of people used to create a taxonomy must be a representative subset of the general population of graphics users. Finally, different techniques for data collection and analysis used to create a classification can and do produce different solutions for the same data.</p><p>In our initial effort to create a classification, we could not address all three of these problems concurrently. Trade-offs were necessary. We chose to seek maximum variability in both the sample of visual representations and the sample of people used to create the taxonomy. Although it increases variability in the data and reduces agreement in the categorization task, it allows us to generalize our findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Items</head><p>Our subjects sorted 40 items. The Sorting Task There are two main types of sorting procedures, top-down and bottom-up. In general, a top-down sorting task is conceptually driven, while a bottomup sorting is data driven18. Top-down sorting emphasizes differences among items. The sorter seeks to discriminate items by their differences. In bottom-up sorting, the sorter creates groups of similar items. The sorter successively combines initial groupings into larger and larger groups of similar items. We chose bottom-up sorting for our categorization task because of its emphasis on similar features among visual representations.</p><p>Subjects sorted forty items into groups of similar items using a bottom-up sorting procedure. Each subject sorted the items individually; the task required 45 to 90 minutes. Subjects could create any number of groups and any number of items per group.</p><p>Once the subjects completed their initial groupings, they described each group and explained why all the items in the group were similar. After the experimenter recorded these descriptions, the subjects continued to combine their initial groupings into larger clusters. Again, the experimenter recorded the subjects' explanations of why all the items within a cluster were similar. This process was repeated until all 40 items were in one cluster.</p><p>In addition to the original sorting task, six of the twelve subjects repeated the sorting task 22 months after the original sorting task. The items and procedures in the re-sort task were identical to those in the original sorting task. The purpose of this resort task was to determine whether the original sorts formed a stable categorization of the items.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis and results</head><p>The analysis of the sorting data required two stages. First, we analyzed the sorting data by subject to determine whether the sorts were homogeneous. Second, we performed an item analysis to uncover the hierarchical structuring of items common to subject sorts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subject analysis</head><p>For each subject, each pair of items could be considered as either being in the same group or not. As a measure of agreement between a pair of sortings, we counted the number of times 1's appeared in the same matrix position for the two subjects. That is, we used the number of times that both subjects sorted pairs of objects into the same group as a measure of their similarity. This measure of similarity is essentially equivalent to the Jaccard coefficient described in Jain and Dubes19.</p><p>In evaluating the measures of similarity, we used the fact that the number of 1-1 matches follows a hypergeometric distribution (see 19 pp. 22-23 for a discussion). Thus, for any integer k, it is possible to compute the probability that the number of 1-1 matches between two groupings equals or exceeds k. This probability measures the degree to which subject matches are due to chance. We computed these probabilities for all subject pairs. where k equalled the number of observed 1-1 matches. Low probabilities indicate stability and consistency of sorting patterns. No probability exceeded 0.006; in fact, more than 95% of the computed probabilities were smaller than .oooOl. The amount of agreement among subjects' sortings dramatically exceeds chance. These data strongly suggest that the subjects have a homogeneous representation of the visual stimuli.</p><p>The re-sort data provide an additional check of the stability of a shared representation. We would have expected that a subject's original sort and re-sort would show more agreement than, say, two different subjects' sorts. This should have been particularly pronounced if different individuals were using quite different representations of the stimuli. However, the high levels of agreement both within and between subjects indicates that subjects have quite similar representations for the items.</p><p>To summarize the results of the subject analysis, we conclude that the entire corpus of sorts was consistent and homogeneous. The item-item similarities were similar even though subjects had disparate levels of graphics expertise. Our subsequent analysis of items pools the data from the twelve subjects into one homogeneous group. The next section describes the commonalities in the derived representation for the twelve subjects across stimulus items.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Item Analysis</head><p>The individual subjects' matrices described above were summed across the twelve subjects' original sortings to give a p l e d similarity matrix. Re-sort data were not included. Entries in this matrix ranged from zero to twelve. Each entry indicated the number of subjects who put the two items in the same group in their lowest level sorting. Both hierarchical cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling were then applied to the pooled matrix.</p><p>Hierarchical First we measured the agreement between these clustering solutions and the original sorting data. We computed the correlation coefficient between the observed distances and the complete linkage solution (.8793) and between the observed and the single linkage solution (.8550). The single and complete cluster trees are also in basic agreement (.8093) which is consistent with an inherent hierarchical structure in the data20. The correlations show good agreement between the original sorting distances and both hierarchical clustering results. Five principal clusters emerged from the cluster analysis of the forty items. We named these clusters using the descriptions provided by our subjects during the sorting task The named clusters represent groups of highly similar items. These homogeneous groups include graphs and tables, maps, diagrams, icons, and network charts. These groups are not too surprising. For example, Bertin describes static, two-dimensional, monosemic visual representations1 l . He excludes a discussion of figurative, polysemic images such as icons and diagrams. The remaining three groups fit the basic groups of visual representations described by <ref type="bibr">Bertin.</ref> Graphs and tables formed a single cluster. Some information properties are common to both forms of visual representation. In fact, graphs and tables are often used interchangeably to express the same data. Graphs refer to most business and statistical graphics that have become popular in computer graphics packages. The range of types include line, bar, pie, Gantt, and categorical graphs. Planar dimensions attribute meaning to the data. One plots the data according to these planar dimensions. The data are shown symbolically using visual features such as color, slope, angle, area, shape, and orientation to express meaning in a graph. Tables are lists or matrices of primarily alphanumeric, non-visual data. Subjects noted that tabular data are read rather than being seen. People locate information using the row and column index. Often tables are void of abstract symbols commonly found in graphics, but some tables contain a mixture of graphic and tabular information (e.g., item 7).</p><p>Maps and diagrams express spatial data. Maps depict geographic location with various levels of abstraction of the true planimetric positions of objects on the map. Diagrams describe the structure of physical objects or interrelationships and processes associated with physical objects. Structure diagrams are a static description of reality; process diagrams express dynamic interrelationships among components of the diagram.</p><p>Icons impart a single interpretation or meaning for a picture. Each icon provides a unique label for a visual representation. Icons are used when the meaning of the icon is readily apparent to the target user population.</p><p>A network chart shows the interrelationships among the components. Symbols indicate the presence or absence of data elements. Correspondences among the data elements are shown by lines, arrows, or containment. The planar dimensions of the network chart generally are void of meaning. Meaning results from an efficient spatial arrangement of the data that is parsimonious and avoids intersecting lines.</p><p>After we identified these major clusters of visual representations, we used multidimensional scaling to confirm the cluster analysis results. Multidimensional scaling helps identify properties that distinguish each cluster. Multidimensional scaling 21-23 positions the items in n-dimensional space so that the inter-item distances in this space match as closely as possible (in a monotonic sense) the original distances. Multidimensional scaling expresses the structure of data spatially, rather than hierarchically. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows a two-dimensional plot of the output from multidimensional scaling. The five groups from cluster analysis remained basically intact. The multidimensional scaling solution lends further credence to the reality of the clusters shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>The horizontal axis of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows graphs and tables on one extreme; maps are on the other extreme. We labeled these extremes discrete and continuous representations. These properties are similar to two of the four basic categories of knowledge representations described by Rumelhart and Norman8. Propositional representations portray knowledge as discrete symbols or propositions.</p><p>Analogous representations have a 1 : 1 correspondence between the real world and the representation.</p><p>The notion of discrete visual knowledge units is appealing. Imagine a line graph showing sales over time. If the task is to compare sales between two periods, then the slope of line segments symbolically depict this knowledge about trends. If the task is to locate extreme periods of sales, then each data point becomes a knowledge unit. Knowledge about a single concept or event is one discrete unit. The data can convey different types of knowledge depending on the graph type and symbolic conventions used to visualize the data. Often the data could convey multiple messages, such as extremes and trends. When people develop a graph to communicate a message to an audience, they must select a graph type that best conveys the intended message.</p><p>Continuous data express knowledge at different levels of resolution. One selects a desirable representation of the data by rotating, panning, or zooming to an appropriate level of resolution.</p><p>Higher levels of organization of continuous data provide structure to lower levels. Often this structure is helpful for orientating the viewer to the information. For example, maps often use multiple levels of resolution to orient the viewer. A city map may show the location of the state in the USA and an area within the state.</p><p>The intermediate nature of network charts on the spatial dimension is not surprising. The spatial arrangement of data in a network chart shows the interrelationships among the components. Meaning results from an efficient spatial arrangement of the data. However, the data do not have a direct 1:l correspondence with real world objects or geographic locations. The vertical axis of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows icons on one extreme; network charts are on the other extreme. One interpretation of this dimension considers the level of cognitive effort required to extract information from the visual representation. Recent work on graphical p e r c e p t i~n~~-~~ has focused on the specific processes people use to decode visual information. MacGregor and S10vic~~ argue that the amount of information processing necessary to transform symbolic information determines the effectiveness of a particular information display.</p><p>The symbolic notation used to visualize network charts is cumbersome. Users must read and view the relationships among the components to extract knowledge from this visual representation. On the other hand, icons are a shorthand notation for a label. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This research is an exploratory effort to classify visual representations into homogeneous clusters.</p><p>Our goal is to identify the type of knowledge conveyed by various visual representations. Five major groups: graphs and tables, maps, diagrams, networks, and icons, emerged from the hierarchical cluster analysis. The multidimensional scaling solution identifies properties that distinguish these clusters. One property suggests that data express discrete or continuous information. The other property, cognitive processing effort, suggests that some visual representations are more efficient than others for conveying certain types of knowledge.</p><p>In many cases, people extract information more easily from spatial representations. Spatial data provide a structured repository for storing and retrieving information. For example, many network management systems use a map rather than a tabular report to display the status of a network. Other interfaces to data management systems, and executive information systems could exploit spatial properties of data. Examples might include systems for retail floor space management, quality control on an assembly line, and auto parts inventory.</p><p>Procedural information seems to require more effort to process than non-procedural information. Dynamic representations can highlight salient chunks of procedural information presented to the viewer to aid the presentation of procedural information, Continuous data navigation tools should allow the user to pan, rotate, and zoom to an appropriate level of resolution that expresses the requisite knowledge. Discrete data visualization tools should allow the user to select a separate visual representation by task such as making comparisons, identifying trends, grouping data, and finding extreme values. These properties have practical implications for data visualization tools. Tools for automating data presentation, exploratory data analysis, visual data analyses, and electronic image processing systems lack ways to characterize image data. The problem is inherent to all visual database systems.</p><p>Recent advances in hypermedia, multimedia, image data management systems, and electronic image processing systems focus on images to convey information. The adage "A picture is worth a thousand words" aptly expresses the value of an image to aid our cognitive processing of information. Unfortunately, we are often unable to write the 1,OOO words that describe the image. The difficulty of describing, indexing, searching, and retrieving information from a visual data system is one of the major impediments to the growth of products in this industry. The crux of the problem is the high degree of inconsistency among indexers who assign terms to index images.</p><p>Recent work on a prototype image-retrieval system at NASA offers a unique solution to the problem associated with indexing visual data systems31. The Johnson Space Center maintains an image repository of over one million images. Users may query the system using key terms or images. An intelligent visual thesaurus automatically converts the images into strings of key terms. The visual thesaurus clusters images hierarchically. The conversion process identifies dominant perceptual features that may be extracted from an image. An algorithm maps these perceptual features to hierarchical clusters of images with similar information features. One critical problem in the development process is generating the key terms from the image hierarchies. Our classification is a first step in this process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Directions for future research</head><p>Our research, while certainly suggestive of an underlying classification structure, has not established a multi-level, deep structure of images.</p><p>We are planning future studies to identify features that characterize visual representations. Our future work will focus on a broad range of visual representations in three different empirical tasks (pairwise comparisons, verbal descriptions of images, and top-down sorting). This work will allow us to test our initial classification and discover superordinate and subordinate structure within the classification of visual representations.</p></div>
