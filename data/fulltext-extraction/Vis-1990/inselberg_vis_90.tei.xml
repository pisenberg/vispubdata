				<p>ABS TRA C T A methodology for visualizing analytic and synthetic geometry in R N is presented. It is based on a system of parallel coordinates which induces a non-projective mapping between N-Dimensional and 2-Dimensional sets. Hypersurfaces are represented by their planar images which have some geometrical properties analogous to the properties of the hypersurface that they represent. A point t-* line duality when N = 2 generalizes to lines and hyperplanes enabling the representation of polyhedra in R N. The representation of a class of convex and non-convex hypersurfaces is discussed together with an algorithm for constructing and displaying m y interior point. The display shows some local properties of the hypersurface and provides information on the point&apos;s proximiry to the boundary. Applications to Air Traffic Control, Robotics, Computer Vision, Computational Geometry, Statistics, Instrumentation and other areas are discussed.</p>

The W physicist Paul Ehrenfest found that planetary orbits in N-dimensional Euclidean space R N are stable if and only if N = 3, precluding other dimensional universes from having a long career <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. Another dimensionality result is that rigid bodies rotating in R N have an axis of rotation if N is un odd munber <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[40]</ref> showing that even the parity of the dimension number can have far reaching implications! For scientists and others studying multi-variate relations or data sets, understanding the underlying geometry of a problem can provide crucial insights into what is possible and what is not. This need to augment our perception, limited as it is by the experience of our three-dimensional habitation, has attracted considerable attention and various visualization methodologies have been proposed (see for example 111, 121, (31, <ref type="bibr">[41, [51, 181, 1101, 1121, 1221, ~3 1 , 1261, (271, (351, (371, (411, (421, 1431, [441 and [451)</ref>.

The same construction can be used to discover proximity when the two lines are nearly intersecting or better yet when their mini" distance is less than some spesied bound. This can be computed very efficiently without need for computing the actual distunce. The construction is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.  A straight line trajectory for constant vector velocity can be represented by three stationary points say T:l , 1:2, 23. The time axis can be thought of as a "clock . At any given time T, the position of the aircraft is found by selecting the value of T on the T-axis. Such a representation also c l d i e s the problem of understanding collision as the intersection in space and time (i.e. both aircraft must be at the same position at the same time; a 4-D intersection) as contrasted to passing through the same position but at different times. An example is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">j = i + 1.

By way of illustration a resolution not involving altitude changes (i.e. in 2 dimensions) for one of these scenarios (scenario 8) is presented. The initial position and constant velocity of the six aircraft involved is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref>. As can be seen from <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> several conflicts arise. An expert Air TrafEc controller resolved the conflicts with four (4) aircraft remaining at the same altitude and changing the altitude of two. It is usually more desirable to avoid altitude changes. Our algorithm was able to resolve all conflicts without altitude changes. There are two key steps.</p><p>The first involves the computation of certain parallelograms which enclose the circular safety zones centered on each aircraft. For example in <ref type="figure">Figure   9</ref> the parallelograms with respect to aircraft 4 and I ' 3.   the remaining aircraft are shown. There may be none, one or two adjacent parallelograms with each circle and they are computed from the relative velocity of that aircraft with respect to aircraft 4. Any aircraft flying with the same velocity as 4 in order to avoid the circles must avoid entering the parallelograms. The second step involves the representation of lines in parallel coordinates by points so that the trajectory information for each circle is represented by intervals on the same line. Aircraft 4, in this case, is in conflict with another aircraft if and only if the points representing the trajectory of 4 are interior to the intervals associated with that aircraft. The interval associated with aircraft k consists of the points representing all paths parallel to the path of 4 which enter the parallelogram of k. The closest conflict-free path for 4, parallel to the original trajectory, is represented by one of the end-points of the union of these intervals. If that end-point lies on yet another</p><p>interval 4 the union is enlarged by including 4</p><p>until eventually a free end-point is found. Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide a short exposition on this interesting application and a proper one would take us too far afield. The   by N -1 vertical lines. Hence, a hyperplane in P N is represented by N -1 vertical lines and a polygonal line P representing one of its points <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>. A feel for the power of the representation can be gained from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref> from which, with a bit of practice, the vertices, edges and faces, and their interrelationshp, of the hypercube can be recognized. A large set of equally spaced points on a hyperplane will show intersections along the vertical lines. There is an alternate elegant hyperplane representation due to Eickemeyer [ 191.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I X ' -</head><p>To motivate it let us look a set of 3-dimensional points (consider at frst only the portion in the first 3 11 axes) shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref> which happen to be on a plane n and are not equally spaced. So the vertical lines reveahg co-planarity of the previous representation are not seen. In fact, no discernible "structure" seems evident. how let us form Iines on the plane n from pairs of these points. These lines are represented by a pair of planar points indexed with two subscripts (i.e. two out of the three <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">collinear points ?12, 2 2 3 z 1 3 )</ref> .</p><p>The collection of lines through the ?. 16. In fact this tums out to be a necessary and sufficient condition for coplanarity! Since a planar point has two independent coordinates more information is needed to identify the specific plane. This shows that the original points belonged to two different planes. To completely identify the planes this process may be repeated with another axes permutation to obtain two more points.</p><p>This may be done by taking another copy of the 3 parallel coordinate axes as shown on the righthand-side of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref> (hence the six axes seen) and represent the original points on n with respect to these axes which effectively have a different horizontal distance between them than the original set, repeating the process and getting another pencil of lines as shown <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 17</ref> at another point say if2311 which tums out to have the same y-coordinate as Cl23 so the coordinates of the two points have enough information between them to identify the plane n that they represent. It is rather remarkable that a plane in 3-dimensions, a two dimensional object technically called 2-flat, can be represented in terms of two pencils of lines which in tum represent its lines (1-dimensional objects called I-flats) in terms of two planar pencil of lines. Recall, that a 1-flat (i.e. in 2-dimensions) is represented by one pencil of lines. It is not difficult to think of situations where discovering coplanarity is of interest, i.e. Computer Vision, Statistics, CAD/CAM etc.. In such cases one would expect the data to have errors so it is important to see if thts representation is numerically stable with "noisy" data. So a set of points which is within "20% of coplanarity" in the sense that given:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">( 5 ) TI, TI, : C l X l + c2x2 + c3x3 = c + c,</formula><p>points on the nominal plane TI are found with c, while points on the "noisy" plane n, are computed by allowing the variation Ic,~ = f .21cl from the nominal. Repeating the process by forming h e s again two pencils of h e s are clearly seen, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  18</ref>, but now with some variation. It would be interesting to study the density of the clusters of intersecting lines picking the two points or better the two positions where the highest number of lines intersect as the "best planar fit" to the data in some reasonable sense.</p><p>This representation, as well as the numerical stability, turns out to be completely general. As an example consider the 6-dimensional points with the same k h d of variation from some nominal hyperplane shown in the fmt six axes in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  19</ref> Repeating the process as is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  20</ref>, for the 1-flats by joining successive pairs of points representing h e a r objects of increasing dimensionality the near coplanarity is discovered from the pencil of lines formed by the points representing the 4-dimensional hyperplanes (4-flats) contained in the hyperplane as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> 1. Repeating this process for the successive axes permutations 234561 <ref type="bibr">', 34561'2', 4561'2'3', 561'2'3'4'</ref> yields 4 more such points. The position of these five points, labeled by the six indices corresponding to their axes permutation completely identify the nominal hyperplane. In general, in N-dimensions an (X-1)-flat is represented by h'-1 pencils of lines (i.e. points) representing (N-2)-flats each point labeled with N indices.</p><p>Points belonging to several planes may also be "separated" in this way. Starting with 100 points in 3-dimensions 100 lines are formed by sampling pairs of points as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 22</ref>. The number of intersecting lines per pixel is recorded, <ref type="figure">Figure</ref> 23, with only two positions having more that 1 "hits", <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 24</ref> indicating that the original point set was on two different planes. This separation method works also in higher dimensions, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 25</ref>, where 4-flats are formed from a set of 500 points in 5-dimensions, the number of intersections per position is shown on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 26</ref> with two positions having more than one <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  27</ref> showing that the points are on two separate hyperplanes.</p><p>In general a pflat in N-space, specified by the (N-p) hearly independent equations, It was mentioned earlier that a convex hypersurface S c P N is represented by ' ( S ) the envelope of is tangent hypersurfaces. T h~s needs to be done stagewise one dimension at a time as for the representation of h'-flats in the previous section. This is currently being investigated. In the meantime, below a simplified hypersurface representation and its possible usefulness is illustrated.</p><p>Here a general convex hypersurface is represented by computing the envelope of the collection of polygonal lines representing its points. The representation of a convex hypersurface in P2' is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 28</ref>. It corresponds to a particular (nonlinear) relation which for our purpose describes a process involving 20 parameters labeled</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">X I , ... ,</formula><p>x20. An N-tuple is a feasible point for the process if and only if it is interior to the hypersurface. This is the geometrical equivalent of the the statement that a particular combination of parameter values satisfies all the constraints imposed on the process. There is an algorithm for finding interior points to such surfaces which is illustrated in the figure.</p><p>The interval on the xi-axis between the upper and lower portions of the envelope indicates the range of parameter xi. When a value for XI = a1 is chosen in the available range of X I the number of variables in the relation is reduced by one (i.e. fram 20 to 19 variables in our example). Again with reference to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 28</ref> from the fixed value of X I tangents to the upper and lower portions of the envelope are drawn (here the points of tangency are not seen since they lie outside the strip between the x1 and x2-axes). The envelope of the 19-dimensional hypersurface is then obtained from the (description) of the original hypersurface with the value X I = al. The restricted available range of x2, due to the constraint of fixing the value of one of the variables, is the interval on the xz-axis between the upper and lower tangents. A polygonal line is shown which always lies between the intermediary envelopes. It represents an interior point to the hypersurface and all interior points can be found in this way.</p><p>When the value of a variable is fixed, the complete envelope of the 19-dimensional surface may be drawn showing at a glance not only the current value of any of the parameters (in this case x l ) but, unlike a conventional "instrument panel", the current available range of all the parameters; t h s is due to the interrelationship among them. There are other salient features of the display. Note that for the parameters x13 , x14 , ~1 5 the available ranges are the narrowest. This indicates that the feasible point is closest to the boundary with respect to these critical parameters. Hence, where there is need for rapid decisions in view of a lot of information (e.g. as is piloting very fast aircraft), sigdicant information reduction can be achieved by controlling the critical parameters whose priority is decided by theirproximity to the boundary. This also brings out the possibdity of displaying or highlighting only the information desired (possibly specitic subsystems) at any given time.

Let's see how this works out. To resolve the conflicts, at T = 0 five aircraft start maneuvers which eventually lead each of them to a new course parallel, and within 5nm of the original one, where they continue flying at their previous constant velocity with the circles exquisitely missing each other. This is shown in Figure 10. There and also in Figure 11 are seen instances of tangent circles. This is because the algorithm minimally disturbs the aircraft from their original paths.

Fortunately t h s is not the case.Wegman's Theorem [6]  states that for N = 2n exactly n "well chosen" displays suffice while for N = 2n + 1, n + 1 display-s suffice. A complete graph of N vertices can be obtained as a union of that many "properly chosen" spanning trees each representing a particular display. Let the ith-node stand for xi and the edge for the pair xi+ Each of the aforementioned spanning trees represents a particular display containing all the variables appearing in the order indicated by the edges. Altogether then O(N) displays contain all possible pairs of variables adjacent to each other since all the corresponding spanning trees yield the complete graph.
