				<p>The use of qualitative shape synthesis for the display of 3-D binary objects, is presented. Instead of the commonly used shading approaches, we propose t h a t intrinsic shape features of the object(s) be the means for the display. The proposed approach is applicable t o multi-object scenes and to outdoor scenery as well. It makes use of a new method, the diffusion process, t h a t simulates diffusion of particles within the interior of a 3-D discrete object. Starting with initial concentrations of particles at the boundary-voxels, the diffusion procedure simulates the propagation of these particles inwards. Boundary voxels of the object are colored according to the concentration of particles obtained by suspending the diffusion process. This method assists shape characterization by providing a qualitative measure of boundary curvature and was used in achieving display of a variety of voxel-based objects. Examples of the use of this approach on synthetic, terrain, and range data, are provided.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Different approaches are available for the display of 3-D objects on a screen. These approaches are strongly dependent on the technique used t o represent the object. Analytical representations are widely used for man-made objects while planar and curved patches <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref> are used for describing the object surfaces. Projection of such objects on a screen involves rotating the vertices of the polygons or the control points, performing visibility tests on the surface parts of the object, and projecting the visible parts on the screen.</p><p>When the object description is based on real data <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31]</ref>, different approaches may be devised. One approach which has been widely applied is the extraction of planar surfaces t h a t approximate the object's boundary <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33]</ref> and projecting these planes on the screen. The extraction of planar surfaces can be achieved by locating surface edges in each slice plane and placing planar surfaces between points that form the object's boundary. The most popular planar surface * This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant IRI-88-02457.</p><p>used for this task has been the triangle <ref type="bibr">[G,l4,22]</ref>. The projection is implemented using hidden-surface removal, shading, transparency, (121 etc. A second approach extracts contours on the object's boundary on a sliceby-slice basis. These contours may be displayed directly by forming a wire frame image, by tiling <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>, or by spline techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">32]</ref>. A third approach represents the object as a part of a 3-D discrete volumetric world t h a t consists of voxels (volume elements).</p><p>Voxel-based representations are derived from 3-D data acquisition techniques such as Computerized Tomography (CT), Ray Scanning, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Ultrasound etc. The display of voxel-based objects is essential in geological surveying <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, in biomedical imaging <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>, partially in CAD <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>, and in computer vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>.</p><p>Different techniques for the representation and rendering of 3-D discrete objects have been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. These techniques may be classified according t o two approaches: the voxel-based approach <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13,</ref><ref type="bibr">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">23]</ref> and the octree approach <ref type="bibr">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr">[37]</ref>. The vonel-based approach represents and displays the object by manipulating each of its constituent voxels. The octree approach represents the object as a hierarchical data structure (i.e., octree) t h a t is displayed by interpreting the corresponding octree nodes. Hidden-surface removal is implemented easily by reading out the cubes t h a t correspond t o nodes of the octree in a recursive back-tofront sequence. The octree representation is efficient in memory requirements, but has the overhead of a large construction-time, Viewing the voxels of a n object can be implemented using a back-to-front (131 method where hidden-surface removal is achieved by reading out the voxels starting from the back of the scene in a slice-by-slice manner. Front-tDback [19,25) is a more time-efficient method. A d a t a structure representing the pixels on the screen is used. At each viewing stage pixels t h a t have not yet been colored are tracked and only those voxels whose image falls onto such pixels are computed. Hence, hidden voxels contribute very little t o the computation time. A third approach, ray tracing [2, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21,</ref><ref type="bibr">30]</ref>, is unique in t h a t boundary-detection and hidden-surface removal are not carried out explicitly. The image is developed CH2913-2/90/0000/0051~01 .OO -1990 IEEE assuming a progress from the screen t o the object rather than vice versa.</p><p>One approach that is used in labeling voxels of a voxel-based object is depth shading <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. In this case, voxels are labeled with colors according t o their distance from the viewpoint. Such an image is called a range image of the object. A second approach is density-depth shading <ref type="bibr">[ll]</ref>. In this case, voxels are colored according t o two criteria, the distance from the viewpoint, and the density value obtained from the C T scanner. A third approach labels each face of a voxel with a different color. For any voxel, at most three faces may be visible from the viewpoint. A fourth approach is based on using light shading techniques <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>. Six light shading methods were reviewed in <ref type="bibr">[ 3 ]</ref> . An interesting approach based on animation was introduced in <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. Shape understanding is enhanced by applying animation on 3-D C T images.</p><p>In this paper we present a new approach to aid the display of 3-D discrete objects. Shape characterization of an object is achieved by labeling each of its boundary-voxels according t o a qualitative curvature measure obtained through a simulation of a diffusion process on the interior of the object. Display of objects is straightforward once the simulation has been completed. Thus no further computation is required. The algorithm was implemented on a parallel computer (Connection Machine).</p><p>Objects need not be convex. The only restriction is one of simple connectivity at voxel level, which can be relaxed by allowing diffusion through edges and vertices. The proposed method can overcome noise as well as certain shape distortion of the examined object. Though global synthesis is performed v l a the diffusion process, the algorithm is entirely based on low-level data (i.e., voxels), therefore avoiding a direct extraction of a higher level representation.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a general overview of the diffusion process followed by its definition, as well as a brief discussion of some of its aspects. In Section 3, we describe the display strategy that we used. Section 4 analyzes the execution time and space requirements of the algorithm. Section 5 contains some concluding remarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Diffusion Simulation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">General Overview</head><p>Diffusion simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref> was recently introduced as a means for shape synthesis of 2-D discrete regions. In this paper we present the 3-D diffusion process and demonstrate some of its characteristics. The discrete diffusion simulation is inspired by the phenomenon of diffusion of gasses: particles diffuse according t o the differences in concentration between regions. Similarly, in the discrete simulation particles diffuse between neighboring voxels according t o the differences in concentration between voxels.</p><p>The diffusion procedure simulates the propagation, after a n initial release, of a given number of particles between object voxels. Initially, only voxels which are at the boundary contain particles. Particles diffuse from the boundary inwards as a result of the inner empty space. The simulated diffusion is discrete, both in time and space. A t each instant of discrete time after the initial release and for each voxel belonging t o the object, the number of particles that it contains is computed. Diffusion is simulated under the isotropic assumption (i.e., the diffusion law is equally applicable in all directions and for all parts of the examined object).</p><p>Concentration of particles tends t o be greater at concavities, lesser at planar or near-planar regions and the least at convexities. Stopping the simulation after differing numbers of diffusion iterations emphasizes different characteristics of the object's boundary shape. Obviously, if the simulation proceeds long enough the system will reach a steady state such that all the voxels belonging t o the object contain an equal number of part i des.</p><p>Our study of the diffusion simulation revealed its potential for shape classification. This classification of shape is tuneable, viewpoint-independent, qualitative, and object dependent. The diffusion process is tuneable in the sense that it can be adjusted, t o a certain extent, t o capture a whole range of shape descriptions, starting with merely a local-based description when a small number of diffusion iterations is performed, and ending with regional and global descriptions when a large number of iterations is performed. It is viewpointindependent because of the intrinsic shape synthesis t h a t is separated from the viewing of the object voxels (in comparison t o the light-shading approach). It is qualitative in the sense t h a t a region's shape can be described as more concave or convex than other regions rather than being associated with an absolute curvature measure (see for example <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). Finally, it is objectdependent because a direct comparison between the curvature of regions of different objects according t o the diffusion results is hard t o achieve (e.g., when a cube is examined, the planar faces are labeled as convexities while the corners and edges are labeled as concavities). We do not view this feature as a disadvantage mainly because the shape synthesis we seek is intended t o be applicable at object-level, not at inter-object level. Furthermore, common display techniques do not address such comparisons between objects. These features, especially viewpoint-independence, make this approach advantageous over standard techniques.</p><p>The diffusion simulation is applicable t o multiobject scenes, as well as outdoor scenes. Having different overlapping or non-overlapping objects does not affect the process since only local operations are carried out. Furthermore, it is worth noting that there are no mutual effects between objects in the scene, unless occlusions occur (i.e., objects are connected). If they are connected, then the boundary between them will be labeled according t o local shape characteristics. Experiments on terrain, indoor, and outdoor (mainly roads) range images have provided good results.</p><p>The diffusion simulation is inappropriate for thin objects. The reason is t h a t particles have very little space to diffuse within, therefore, the concentrations remain almost the same as in the initial conditions. Objects such as thin planes, brushes, etc. are basically 2D objects that are viewed in 3-D volume and therefore it is not surprising t h a t the diffusion simulation that works on 3-D volumes becomes ineffective in such cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Definitions</head><p>A voxel is associated with three integer coordinates t h a t represent its location in space, and a n integer density t h a t describes its contents. An object is called a binary object when the density value of a voxel belonging t o the object is '1' and '0' when it does not. A boundary-voxel is a n object-voxel such t h a t at least one of its face-adjacent voxels does not belong t o the object (i.e., has a '0' density value). A 3-D discrete scene is represented as a three-dimensional array of voxels.</p><p>Three possible adjacencies may occur between two voxels: face, edge, and veTtex adjacencies. The connectivity of an object is based on adjacency between voxels. An object is /ace-connected if for any two object-voxels U and U ' there is a sequence</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v v = ( v ) , v 2 , . .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>. , U, =(U')</head><p>of object-voxels such t h a t each two consecutive voxels are face-adjacent. An object is edge-connected if any consecutive voxels can be face-adjacent or edge-adjacent. An object is vertex-connected if any consecutive voxels can be face-adjacent, edge-adjacent, or vertex-adjacent. We assume a face-connected object, although our approach may be extended t o deal with edge and vertex connected objects as well (as explained later on).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Diffusion Definition</head><p>Before starting the diffusion simulation, boundaryvoxels of the object are initialized so that each contains N p particles. It is intuitively clear that as N p increases, so does the shape differentiation between voxels. Nonboundary interior voxels as well as exterior voxels are initially assigned zero particles. Although, conceptually, particles can diffuse through faces, edges, and vertices, we only focus on simulating diffusion through faces.</p><p>Let Ni,j,k(t) denote the number of particles in the object voxel at coordinates ( i , j , k ) a t time t. The following equation expresses the number of particles in voxel ( i , j , k ) at time t + 1: <ref type="figure">j , L ( t + l ) = N i , j , h ( t )</ref>  Equation (1) expresses the requirement that the number of particles in a given voxel of the object at time t+l equals the number of particles that were there at time t , minus the number of particles that were transferred t o the neighboring voxels, plus the number of incoming particles from those same neighbors, based on their respective contents at time t . Neighboring voxels t h a t lie outside the object do not participate in the process so they maintain the initial zero number of particles.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">N i ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">-V , K/ Ni,j.k(t)+K/ { Ni-~,j,k(t) (1) + Ni+I, i, h ( t + Ni, j -1 , L ( t + Ni, j + I , L ( t + Ni, j , h -~( t + Ni,j, +~( t</formula><p>Diffusion through edges and vertices of voxels could also be allowed. In such a case, equation (1) must be modified t o represent the transfer of particles through edges and vertices. Obviously, the face-connectivity assumption is needed when diffusion takes place through faces only. In particular, in this case edge-adjacent or vertex-adjacent voxels have no opportunity for affecting their neighborhood, nor are they affected by it throughout the diffusion process. Allowing diffusion through faces, edges and vertices weakens the connectivity requirement.</p><p>The concentration of particles at each boundaryvoxel is dominated by the number of its face-adjacent neighbors. If a voxel is a part of a convex region it has fewer neighbors that participate in the diffusion process than a voxel belonging t o a concave region. The fewer neighbors a voxel has, the fewer particles it loses, and the fewer particles it receives. Hence, boundary-voxels preserve their contents longer at convexities than at concavities.</p><p>The output of the diffusion simulation is primarily a local shape measure though it expands t o include global shape characteristics. Perhaps the term regional shape measure describes it better. By regional shape we mean a description that is affected by the immediate neighborhood and in some degree also by further voxels. A voxel's region is the set of voxels that affect the voxel's content throughout the diffusion simulation. Since the region concept is time-dependent, it is considered as a fuzzy set of voxels although it can be counted through an extra computation effort. This set expands as the diffusion simulation proceeds and eventually, if the simulation is allowed t o continue long enough, the set will include all voxels of the object. It should be noticed that the regional interpretation of the diffusion process does not weigh close and far voxels equally. Instead, it results in a n exponential decrease in weight which is proportional t o the distance from the central voxel <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Aspects of the Diffusion Simulation</head><p>Given a n initial voxel-based binary representation of a n object, the diffusion simulation assigns numeric labels t o the boundary voxels according t o their regional shape. Local features of the object's shape dominate the initial steps. As diffusion proceeds, regional features begin t o domifiate and local characteristics tend to vanish.</p><p>The diffusion simulation is affected by the following factors: the value of the diffusion constant, the voxeladjacency used in the diffusion process, and the stopping time.</p><p>Theoretical and simulation work on 2-D images has shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref> that the number of iterations needed t o obtain certain densities on the boundary is approximately inversely proportional t o the diffusion constant I(/ (i.e., if K f . t is kept constant, an equal number of particles is 1 obtained on the boundary; however, ICf is bounded by -6 in the 3-D case). This means that there is a trade-off between the value of the diffusion constant and the number of diffusion iterations. We emphasize that the observed relation between the diffusion constant and the stopping time reduces the number of free parameters to one. Either the diffusion constant Kf or the number of iterations can be used as the free parameter. However, as explained in the following paragraphs, the optimal stopping time is not yet well defined.</p><p>When comparing results in the cases of diffusion through faces, edges and vertices with those through faces only, it was found that a relatively low value of the diffusion constant through edges and vertices (compared t o the value of the diffusion constant through faces) had little effect on the results <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>. However, when the values of the diffusion constants through edges and vertices got closer t o the value of the diffusion constant through faces, it was observed t h a t the higher diffusion activity contributes t o earlier discrimination of noise and shape distortion, but at the cost of weakening the sharpness of highly curved regions. Therefore, our conclusion is t h a t diffusion through faces is preferable t o diffusion through faces, edges and vertices. For example, the artifacts seen in the image of the teapot in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> are due t o the quantization. A higher quality image may be achieved by allowing diffusion through edges or vertices.</p><p>The effectiveness of the diffusion simulation is due t o the transient period through which the system passes. Therefore, the stopping time of the diffusion simulation is very critical in evaluating the obtained results. The effect of the stopping-rule was studied in the 2-D case <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>, and the conclusions were applied t o the 3-D case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1 -The difference between the maximum and minimum particles' densities on the boundary</head><p>Applying a stopping rule that maximizes the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the densities of the particles along the boundary-voxels <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref> was found effective in cases t h a t magnification of local features was desired. When studying the value of the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the particles' densities on the boundary it was observed t h a t this difference increases continuously starting from the initial state and at a certain time later it starts t o decrease until the steady state is reached <ref type="figure">(Figure 1)</ref>. Allowing the diffusion process t o run further proved effective in giving the object a more homogeneous form since the longer the diffusion process lasts, the more each voxel's content is affected by non-neighbor voxels (i.e., each voxel expresses the whole region's shape rather than its shape with respect to its immediate neighborhood).</p><p>On the other hand, a longer diffusion time weakens the sharpness of shape characteristics (see <ref type="figure">Figures 5, 6 and</ref> Our empirical results suggest t h a t few tens of iterations are needed for achieving the best rendering results. Specifically, 40-100 iterations were found optimal for most objects, when ICf is set to 0.0625. 8).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Display of the Results</head><p>Synthetically constructed objects and real d a t a (terrain and range images) were used t o demonstrate the performance of the diffusion simulation. Analytic representations of 2-D and 3-D structures were used t o produce digitized 3-D data, hence introducing noise and distortion of shape. Moreover, objects that were rich in curvature changes were constructed so that more reliable results could be achieved (see <ref type="figure">Figures 5-8)</ref>. The real d a t a was noisy, especially the terrain image.</p><p>A t the time the diffusion simulation is stopped, each voxel belonging to the object has a certain density of particles. These densities are sufficient for characterizing the object's shape. Only boundary-voxels are involved in the following interpretations.</p><p>Each voxel is given a color according t o the number of particles it contains. Two approaches, absolute and relative are available for this mapping. The absolute approach divides the whole range (in our simulations 0 -10000 particles) into equal parts, each part having a unique color (in our experiments 255 colors). The relative approach divides the range between the highest and lowest numbers of particles as detected on the boundary of the object at t h e stopping time of the diffusion. This range is divided into equal p a r t s -o n e for each color. The latter method was chosen since it provides a n object-dependent labeling. However, if a comparison between different objects is required, then the absolute approach may be preferable. In cases that the main interest is t o study only convex regions (or concave regions), a logarithmic division might be preferred instead of the linear division. This means that a greater resolution is achieved at convex regions than at concave regions (or vice versa).</p><p>Color must be selected carefully for a clear and accurate display. If the goal is to display a smooth image then different shades of the same color are used in the color lookup table. O n the other hand, by using different shades of two colors a better contrast of the regional characteristics of the object's shape is displayed.</p><p>We assume that the object is enclosed in a unit cube (normalized world), and that the viewpoint may be at any of its corners. Scaling is achieved by setting a clipping box and mapping it t o the world's cube where the spacing in each axis may differ from t h a t in the other axes. If the clipping box is a cube then a n equal scaling in each axis is achieved and the image will express the real shape dimensions of the 3-D object. W e emphasize t h a t our choice of viewing objects along the cube body diagonals is for the sake of simplicity of implementation. Since our approach is viewpoint-independent, any location for the viewpoint will yield an image of comparable quality.</p><p>It is possible t o select a part of the object and display it without additional computation. A 3-D clipping box is set and only voxels within the box are displayed. The box is constructed from planes parallel t o the 2-y, 2--2, and y-z planes.</p><p>Since we used the Connection Machine for implementing the algorithm, a parallel Z-buffer was used t o minimize the running time.</p><p>Viewing of a voxel on the screen is computed by a linear transformation matrix that performs a parallel projection of the scene. The viewing is computed in a This transformation was found quite effective ing images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Complexity</head><p>Most of the algorithms t h a t manipulate in produc-3-D voxelbased data suffer-from high demand of memory resources. Representing high quality 3-D scenes consumes memory ranging from a few Megabytes t o a few tens of Megabytes. The diffusion simulation is no exception t o this. Each value of a voxel is represented by a two byte integer and for each voxel two values are saved, the value at time t and the value at time t + l . This means that four bytes are needed for each voxel (a single byte value is not sufficient due t o the low resolution between voxel values). Thus, the space requirement is o(n3), where n is the number of voxels along each axis.</p><p>Computation time depends on the number of voxels t h a t belong t o the object and the worst-case time complexity, on a serial machine, is o ( n 3 t ) (i.e., when the object occupies the whole space, n is the number of voxels in each axis, and t is the number of diffusion iterations). An advantage of the algorithm is t h a t computing the values at each instance of time consists only of add and shift operations. The value of the diffusion constant can be set t o such values so t h a t multiplications can be performed by shift operations. Thus, special purpose hardware can significantly speed up the computations. In particular, a massively parallel machine is suitable for running the diffusion simulation.</p><p>We performed our simulations on the Connection Machine. The execution time of the program was substantially shorter than on a serial machine. A hardware configuration of lGK processors was able t o perform 650 diffusion iterations per minute for a 3-D vector of 128 voxels in each dimension. The time complexity on the connection machine is o(t) assuming t h a t each physical processor simulates a single voxel (if the ratio is not one, t will be multiplied by a constant representing the number of voxels each physical processor represents, although it may still be regarded as O ( t ) ) .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">. Conclusions and future Work</head><p>A new method that synthesizes the shape of 3-D voxel-based objects was described. This method uses simple computations involving add and shift operations. Local and regional characteristics of shape were extracted by processing low level data. This approach is unique in being independent of the viewing location (i.e., intrinsic), thereby, minimizing the cost of repeated display (e.g., change of the viewing location in space). No assumptions on the structure of the objects were required. A good performance was achieved on noisy environments and on partially distorted objects.</p><p>No smoothing techniques were applied t o the 3-D results nor t o the 2-D image. It is obvious that smooth-ing a t any level can enhance the quality of the displayed images. Different image enhancements can be applied in order t o improve the quality of the displayed image. Smoothing of the 3-D data (before or after the simulation) or the 2-D image may prove beneficial. Defining criteria for the optimal number of diffusion iterations is being addressed in our current work.</p><p>Contrary t o the popular light-shading approach, once the object's shape is obtained through the diffusion simulation it can be rendered from any viewing location repeatedly without additional computations. The p r e posed approach does not provide satisfying results when elongated and very thin objects (discretely measured) are examined since particles have very little space to diffuse within.</p><p>The diffusion approach is applicable t o various environments where the display and shape understanding of 3-D voxel-based objects are needed. Medical imaging is the most appropriate since 3-D data is acquired by means of voxels. Although the initial voxels are not cubes, they can be converted into cubes using a simple interpolation. Geological surveying is another field where the approach can be applied. Computer graphics applications and computer vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref> are also good candidates for the diffusion approach. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1</head><label></label><figDesc>Kf is the diffusion constant.
