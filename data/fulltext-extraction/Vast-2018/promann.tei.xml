				<p>Social data charts-visual presentations of quantitative data about peer behaviors-may offer new means to motivate individuals to participate in group goals. However, to do so these charts need to create a semantic response of &apos;unity&apos; among the chart viewers in order to overcome the problems of social loafing where people act selfishly and undervalue the group&apos;s goal. In this paper, we focus on two properties of social data charts that may affect a viewer&apos;s perceptions of unity: (1) The skewness in the data structure-the statistical distribution of the social data, and (2) the proximity in the visual structure of the chart-the spatial organization of the data points. We performed a controlled perceptual experiment to examine the effect of proximity and skewness on four different semantic facets of perceived group unity: similarity, entitativity, rapport, and centrality. We exposed 179 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk to different group charts using a 2 x 2 factorial design, varying both proximity and skewness. Our two-way ANCOVA analyses reveal three important findings: (1) Across all conditions, proximity has a strong positive effect on perceived group unity and conveys a social meaning of group entitativity, as well as, member similarity and rapport; (2) Skewness and proximity interact in a non-linear way, suggesting that skewness creates a negative force that modifies the semantic responses to high proximity; and (3) The perceptual responses to proximity have different semantic facets that are either stable or sensitive to skewness. These findings contribute to perceptual as well as social InfoVis literature.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Data charts with quantitative data about a person's daily activities have become an important means to motivate individuals to achieve their personal goals. End-user applications on personal devices like mobile phones, tablets, TVs, or other applications visually present us feedback on our behaviors related to fitness routines, personal finance, or education <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, for many of our society's challenges a focus on individual goals is not sufficient to overcome 'social dilemmas': situations were maximization of self-interests results in outcomes where all participants are worse off compared to feasible alternative choices focused on group goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Examples can be found in many aspects of our everyday life. Tasks like recycling, energy conservation, public protests, juries or organizational committees require cooperation and pooling of individual efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Unfortunately, such group tasks often fail because people act individualistically and engage in social loafing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>: They undervalue the group's goal compared to their individual one and lower their contributions. Economists <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and social psychologists suggest that one way to overcome the problem of social loafing is to enhance a group's social identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>[9] <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Individual's motivations to contribute to their group's goal can be significantly improved by group identification and in-grouping <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, which require individuals to perceive the group as being united <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we focus on social data visualizations. Particularly, we study the role of visual cues in social data charts: visual presentations of quantitative data about social peer behavior and their ability to convey a conceptual 'meaning' of perceived unity of a group. Group tasks with group goals are unique from a perceptual information visualization (InfoVis) point of view, as they lend themselves to two alternative and also conflicting interpretations of numerical information: from an individualistic or from the perspective of the group as a whole.</p><p>Existing literature has tackled this problem from two different perspectives. The first and established stream of perceptual InfoVis has furnished deep insights into the effects of visual structures on attentive and semantic responses to the presented data <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Visual chart structure refers to the spatial organization of data points (e.g., data density <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> or hierarchy <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>). The second stream of so called social InfoVis has applied these effects to social cues in social data visualizations, and studied the negative motivational responses when such cues trigger individualistic interpretations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Indeed, skewed social data suggests imbalances among individual contributions, resulting in lack of motivation and individuals dropping out from participating in group tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In this paper, we tackle an important research gap relevant to both literature streams: the lack of theoretical explanation of how visual cues created by the visual structure of social data charts affect perceptions of group unity, and if the interpretation of the underlying social data is taken into account.</p><p>To close this gap, we draw upon literature on Gestalt <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and perception of grouping <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> that has furnished theoretical explanations of how information cues about group member physical traits in graphical visualizations and real-world images shape our perceptions of grouping <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. We use this established theory and translate it into the context of group tasks, which face problems of social loafing. We theorize that proximity in the visual structure of a social data chart (the spatial organization of data points) can shape an individual's perception of unity. Further, we argue that the effect of the visual structure, and in particular its proximity, is distinct from the data structure and the statistical property of the social data visualized <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The data structure on its own may create information cues for perceived unity. If numerical values are skewed, information cues about members' efforts presented in the chart may negatively affect perceptions of unity. Thus, both (1) the proximity in the visual structure of the chart, and (2) the statistical data structure of the social data depicted are both important properties of chart visualization that may affect perceptions of unity. With these theoretical arguments in mind, this paper answers the overarching question: How does proximity (visual structure) and skewness (data structure) in a group chart affect individual perception of group unity?</p><p>To answer this question, we engage in theory-guided design and controlled perceptual experiments to evaluate four different group charts. The charts vary in terms of proximity (low-high) and skewness (skewed-balanced). We design our charts for the context of home energy monitoring and group-oriented energy conservation. To test the joint effect of proximity in the visual structure and skewedness on perceived unity, we design and implement a controlled online experiment using 179 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). We use a 2 x 2 factorial design and analyze our data using a two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).</p><p>We present three major findings: First, proximity in the visual structure of the chart (data density) has positive effects on perceived unity across all facets of group perception, while skewness affects only perceptions of group member similarity. Hence, the more proximate the visual presentation of the social data the more likely it is that individuals assign a conceptual meaning of 'unity' to the underlying data. Second, quite unexpectedly according to prior InfoVis literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, we find a non-linear joint effect of visual structure and data structure on perceived unity; however, this effect is not the same for all facets of group unity. Balance amplifies the effect of proximity and also moderates its social meaning in terms of rapport (harmony) and centrality (belonging to the group). Third, we also find that proximity creates a stable semantic response of entitativity, which is insensitive to skewness. This suggests that certain combinations of proximity and skewness create unique social perceptions. These three findings make important contributions to two streams of literature in InfoVis, namely perceptual InfoVis and social InfoVis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">THEORY DRIVEN DESIGN AND HYPOTHESES</head><p>In this section, we introduce our theoretical model that guided our theory-driven design. Our theorizing builds upon the assumptions of social (or group) identity theory that argues that group identity is essential to overcome problems of social loafing in social dilemmas. Our theoretical model ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>) connects social psychological theories of group identity with cognitive theories of form perception (Gestalt) to theorize about the role visual cues play in social data charts and how they affect the perceived unity of social groups. The dependent variable in our model is perceived unity. The two independent variables relate to two properties of a social data chart: 1) proximity as a visual chart trait (here forth referred to as visual structure) defines how data is spatially organized, and 2) the skewness of statistical values represented by the data points (here forth referred to as data structure). Below, we discuss the concept of perceived unity and integrate social identity theory with Gestalt theory to develop our theoretical assumptions about how chart properties may convey the semantics of 'perceived unity'. Then we develop our hypotheses of how the two properties of a chart -proximity and skewness -affect perceived group unity. We discuss the implications for our chart design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Perceptions of Groups and Their Unity</head><p>As discussed in the introduction, theories of social identity suggest that one's perception of and identification with a social group is vital for successful group collaboration <ref type="bibr">[11][24]</ref>. This is especially relevant in social dilemma situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, where there is a conflict between individual and collective interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Social Group Perception and Identification</head><p>Group literature defines groups as social entities that entail two or more individuals who possess common identity, goals, fate, patterns of behavior and/or modes of interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Group members will also hold shared perceptions about the group: regarding its structure, member interdependency, mutual understanding, and interpersonal reciprocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Indeed, it is commonly accepted that for a group to exist, it needs to be perceived as a social unit rather than a random collection of individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. As such, group identity relies on group perception to trigger awareness of the group and to induce one's identification as a member of that group. Perceiving a unified (vs. not unified) social group is important because it often mediates one's selfidentification with the group <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The social meaning of group unity has different semantic nuances, but the most common ones are: (1) the similarity of group members (physical or psychological) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, (2) entitativity of the social group (cohesion or oneness) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, (3) rapport between group members (i.e., harmony) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and (4) centrality, which refers to one's relative position in or integration with the group (i.e., belonging) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>For instance, a collection of individuals with similar physical traits, such as sports team uniforms or skin color, or shared psychological attributes (e.g. artists being creative versus engineers being analytical), are often seen to belong to a group because the members are seen to be similar by sharing certain physical or psychological traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Furthermore, previous research in psychology has shown how watching a group of individuals engage in concerted behavior has led to inferences of them having rapport, because they share a common goal that they are working towards <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Both, similarity in physical traits (e.g., same skin color) and rapport from concerted collective behavior (e.g., same movement) have shown to trigger perceptions of entitative social groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. This is deemed related but not the same as perceptions of group member similarity or rapport <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Much of the group perception literature has studied perceivable social groups, such as people in photographs or video footage. We translate the theoretical arguments to the context of social data charts to explain how visual and data structures used in these charts lead to group-oriented perceptions, even if people are not co-present but merely represented as abstract data points.</p><p>Next, we turn to visual perception of form and grouping (i.e. Gestalt) to connect both theoretical views.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Visual Perception of Form and Groups (Gestalt)</head><p>Visual perception literature informs us how the human visual system analyses images and visual scenes. The original theories of texture discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and individual feature maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> explain how our low-level visual system detects a handful of visual properties (e.g., hue, form and orientation) pre-attentively without our cognitive effort (i.e., in less than 200 milliseconds). The field has agreed that there is a hierarchical structure to how we make sense of the visual field <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Rooted in limited attention theory, the similarity theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> suggests that the visual field is segmented into structural units that share some features (e.g. spatial proximity, hue, shape, motion) and which may be segmented further into smaller units if the general cluster matches what we are looking for.</p><p>The Gestalt theory of grouping, in particular, explains what structural units trigger people to innately perceive visual elements as groups, clusters, patterns or objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> helping us make quick sense of what we are looking at. In general, the perception literature postulates that there are two levels of perception: (1) a global form, where the individual elements are perceived as one unified cluster or shape, and (2) local elements that are geometrically independent from the global structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Numerous studies have explored how users transition between the two levels. The consensus is that people perceive a few proportionally larger elements as individual objects in the global scene, while many relatively similarly sized small elements as one unified global form. In the latter case, the individual visual elements are grouped into and interpreted as a unified whole <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>The numerous perceptual experiments have led to the identification of Gestalt laws that present a set of perceptual principles that classify visual elements according to specific perceptual effects, such as grouping, enclosing and continuing. The Gestalt law of proximity in particular, is based on numerous perceptual studies that have revealed how scene elements close to one another and densely organized are perceptually grouped together <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Proximity in dot patterns has shown to convey a semantic meaning of belonging together <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. This suggests that such proximity can have priming effects similar to linguistic priming. For example, terms such as "we" vs. "I" can prime an interdependent mindset and lead individuals to take more cooperative actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Indeed, recent literature has found a reliable subliminal priming effect for the Gestalt law of proximity <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>We extend the perceptual theory of grouping with insights from a social psychological theory of group perception to explain how proximity in the visual structure (spatial data density) affects perceptions of unity ( §2.2). We use insights from social psychology and group perception to hypothesize that skewness in data affects human perceptual responses to that data ( §2.3). As illustrated in our model in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, we use the Gestalt law of proximity to explain the effect on user perceptions of social unity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Chart Property I: The Effect of Proximity in the Visual Structure on Perceived Unity</head><p>Data charts are the most basic forms to visually present quantitative data in two or more dimensions. Informed by the Gestalt theory of grouping and the law of proximity, we focus on proximity as a property of the chart's visual structure and its communicative role in conveying semantic meaning about the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Gestalt theory argues that patterns with a few relatively large elements are perceived as individual parts of the overall form (the individual elements remain perceptually salient) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Conversely, by increasing the number of elements and/or decreasing their size, one can amplify the perception of the unified form (i.e., group) ahead of the individual data points. Indeed, research has confirmed how humans cluster relatively homogeneous dot patterns suggesting that denser placement of data points leads to global clustering of the dot patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>Spatial aspects are also discussed in the group literature in social psychology. Spatial proximity can function as a physical property of group members. For instance, we naturally assume that people walking on the street together are a group. Furthermore, Ip, Chiu and Wan <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, for instance, found evidence that visual similarity applied to abstract objects functioned as social cues about the physical traits of social actors and lead to enhanced group perceptions of united 'flocking'.</p><p>We apply this spatial density to social data in a chart where social actors are only indirectly represented. We argue that the Gestalt law of proximity may convey social proximity in a way that it mediates our interpretation of the social data presented in the chart. Essentially, we argue that proximity as a visual property of a social data chart construes social perceptions of group unity.</p><p>This argument that group perception can be mediated via visual data density (i.e., the design law of proximity) had implications for our chart design. We minimized the perceivable size of the data points (i.e., not using bulky bars or a visually connected line chart) and the distance between individual data points. In essence, we create dense data visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. We expect these visual cues to be associated with a stronger perception of a global visual structure (i.e., a group, rather than the individual data points). Based on the evidence collected in perceptual experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, proximal placement of visual elements (in our case data points in a chart) should lead to a clustering effect, whereby the data points would be perceived as a unified "global structure".</p><p>We hypothesize (H1) that proximal placement of behavioral data points of one's peers in a chart (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2b</ref> below) may lead to enhanced perceptions of group unity (vs. the low proximity in the visual structure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig 2a)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Chart Property II: The Effect of Skewness in Data Structure on Perceived Unity</head><p>Information cues created by the numerical data itself play a crucial role in charts, because statistical properties of data carry meanings <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. As such, they affect how users perceive and understand the data presented in the chart. For example, statistical properties like variance carry meanings of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> and can affect human performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. In social settings, where actions of individuals are often interdependent, data structure plays an important role as it can shape the perception of uncertainty related to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>[44] <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Coordinated behavior patterns are foundational to social interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Hence, balanced data structures (without a skew) are foundational for encouraging collaborative and cooperative behaviors as well as sustaining them <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>[5] <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. This is because they convey balanced effort or contributions from all members. Conversely, a heavily skewed data structure may lead to negative group perceptions and lead to member dropouts, regarding their participation in group oriented efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. As such, data structure is a crucial property of any chart that visualizes behavioural data of a social group.</p><p>Based on previous literature on social identity, we argue that data structure (skewness) is a property that affects how humans perceive and interpret social data charts. Skewness in the data carries social cues about others' behaviors. Based on this we expect people looking at a balanced data structure to perceive the represented social group to be more alike versus if they were looking at a skewed data. Conversely, skewed data suggests that group members are loafing and acting out of self-interest, triggering more self-oriented interpretations of the chart.</p><p>We hypothesize (H2) that a balanced data structure (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  3a</ref>), will lead to higher perceptions of group unity, in comparison to an unbalanced data structure (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3b)</ref>, where the underlying data is skewed. Imbalances and variances are essential when it comes to perceptions of group member similarity and their homogeneity. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">STUDY DESIGN AND METHOD</head><p>In our research design process, we combined theory-driven design with a controlled perceptual experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>). We integrate theories of group (social) identity with theories of form perception (Gestalt) to design our social data charts. Our goal is to test the effect of (1) proximity in the visual structure, and (2) skewness in the data structure in a controlled perceptual setting. Our aim was to disentangle the main effects of each property to derive theoretical explanations of their individual effects across different factor levels of the other property. Besides testing our hypotheses 1 and 2, we also explored potential interaction effects.</p><p>To ensure ecological validity of our results <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, we embedded the perceptual study in a real-world scenario of energy conservation. This was important in order to allow social meaning to be constructed, and to control for the particular task context. We performed a series of qualitative tests with potential participants to receive iterative feedback on our study constructs and chart designs. We qualitatively tested and confirmed the accuracy of chart perceptions on mobiles. We then piloted our study on AMT (n=50) using a chart that had a high proximal visual and a high skewed data structure (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). We trialled our constructs designed to elicit responses in terms of perceptions of social unity. The pilot also included a ranking task of our chart designs, which preliminarily confirmed that participants saw the balanced and proximally designed charts as more unifying than their alternatives. Qualitative exploratory questions about why they ranked the way they did, confirmed that participants understood the data and the chart, including its x-and y-axes. For example, one participant explained: "A ll of the charts appear to be showing the exact same information, but I chose the green one [the highlight effect to mark their selection] because the closer grouping of the households makes the energy usage per month visually appear the closest".</p><p>The pilot result helped us refine our charts and validate or improve our scales. For example, we had originally included another treatment effect after the Gestalt law of Common Fate (marked as a downward arrow on each dot: ), to explore group goal orientation, however, this design had led to conflicting user understandings. We chose to explore the Gestalt law of common fate in future research, perhaps as animation effects. Given our focus on social interpretation, and concerns over the length of the study (the longer the study, the more risk of losing a successful prime <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>) we chose to run a simple study to explore the visual versus data structure effects on social interpretation.</p><p>After the refinement of our experimental procedure, we employed a fully controlled 2 x 2 factorial design following a between-subjects experimental set up. Our hypotheses suggested examining the main effects of data structure (skewness) and visual structure (proximity) on four different semantic categories of perceived unity (discussed in §3.5.2). We chose to disentangle the main effects of one factor (e.g. proximity) across different factorlevels of the second factor (e.g. skewness). In our full study we had four different treatment conditions (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>), where we exposed our participants to different visual stimuli (charts) that varied in terms of their visual structure (high-low proximity) and data skewness (high versus low). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Scenario</head><p>Visual metaphors in visualizations are known to rely on users mental maps or contextual understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. To truly measure social perceptions, we needed a scenario where users could perceive the visual stimuli (chart) as a representation of some social group <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>As mentioned above, to have ecologically valid results, we use a housing community scenario where 25 households in Indiana (IN), USA, had a group goal to lower their energy usage. We chose the residential energy context for three reasons: (1) With the rise of smart home technologies, there is an increased interest in home monitoring applications that use behavioral data to motivate sustainable home resource management <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> At the beginning of our study, we informed AMT participants about an actual housing community in West Lafayette, IN, USA, and asked them to imagine that they had relocated to IN and moved into one of the 25 houses in the community. We stated that the housing community shared one utility provider and had a shared goal to lower the community aggregate energy consumption in an effort to lower their monthly energy bills. We introduced the energy feedback display as the primary means of monitoring the community's energy usage on a monthly basis (see Supporting Document for an illustration).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Data and Chart Design</head><p>We used actual 2016 energy consumption data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) to create a data set containing averaged monthly energy consumption values for 25 households. It followed a normal distribution curve. Based on this data set, we created a second data set with a greater degree of skewness (and slightly higher kurtosis).</p><p>Our chart designs were modelled after existing home energy monitoring displays <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, but omitted color, embellishments and contextual information for experimental purposes. We preserved traditional chart features, like title, x-axis (energy usage volume in kWh) and y-axis (no encoded meaning) to ensure users perceived the visualization as a data chart. Informed by the Gestalt law of proximity and perceptual theories of group unity, we designed a dot chart that depicts behavioral information about energy use in a housing community.</p><p>To achieve a visually dense data structure, we avoided traditional chart shapes (i.e., bars and lines) and rendered just one data dimension, omitting the y-axis with household labels. For consistency, we omitted house labels from the base chart with low proximity visual structure. Our formative user feedback; however, confirmed of the benefit of preserving the y-axis line as a visual cue for 0 consumption level. We explored various shapes during our informal user feedback sessions and concluded that circles were least suggestive of any particular order (versus rectangles) or direction (triangles). Lastly, Gestalt laws are known to overlap and reinforce each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. As such, we acknowledge that shape consistency may reinforce the perceived similarity, and that contrast between figure (data dots) and chart background may also trigger effects of enclosure in high proximity charts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Data Collection Process</head><p>We collected our data between December 2017 (pilot) and February 19, 2018 (final study). Our final perceptual study was 15-20 minutes long. We posted it on AMT as a HIT titled "Questions about visual charts depicting household's energy usage". We directed participants to our Qualtrics survey and used its randomization function to assign participants to our four treatment groups. The study went through the following steps ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>):</p><p>First, we presented participants with a consent form that explained the purpose, rules and conditions of the study such as voluntary participation, compensation of up to $2 US dollars, and confidentiality clause. To control for graph literacy, we showed participants a normal dot chart of 10 houses' energy consumption and asked them to identify the highest energy user. In our pilot we had used Okan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> graph literacy tests, but found that the more complex chart errors (i.e., not noticing title-axis conflict or reversed y-axis) had no effect on our chart comprehension.</p><p>We then presented participants with the scenario of moving to a real housing community in IN, USA (see Supporting Document) followed by one of the four charts depending on their treatment group. We asked them to "Take 30 seconds to view this chart. Then express your feelings about it". We used a countdown timer, which replaced the chart with the first of the three response task surveys that asked them to express how they felt about what they saw in the chart. We used general language to phrase our instructions: "Based on the chart, please express your perceptions on ONE of the five positions, indicating how you feel about the chart in view of the opposing words." To avoid repetition and worker fatigue, we started a sentence "The households are…" and presented the opposing words with five tick mark options in between them.</p><p>We showed the chart again ahead each of the dependent variable constructs that measured workers' perceptions of the group's similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, entitativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, rapport <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and centrality <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Initially, we used the original Likert scales used in the above studies; however, we learned from our pilot that these scales did not trigger sufficient variability in responses as the scale design triggered people to select the 'indifferent' middle point on the scale. We translated the scales into semantic differentials based on opposing terms (e.g., The households are similar vs. The households are dissimilar). For centrality, we used an established visual scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Please see §3.5.2 for a detailed description of these measures and scales used.</p><p>As seen in gray on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>, after the chart stimuli and perceptual unity response tasks, we performed a few explorative tasks (e.g., one shot game, chart tagging task and chart comparison), however; it is due to space limitations that we cannot cover these in this paper. To control for individual differences in terms cooperative behavior and existing energy conservation behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>[54], we surveyed workers with brief personality <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> and current energy behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> surveys. We concluded with demographic and housing situation questions, including US state they currently live in, income level, age, gender, completed degree, building type and which bills they paid. Finally, we asked them to sign an honors code statement that asked whether they think that their responses are reliable to be used in scientific research with potential public policy implications. As a result, two cases were eliminated (resulting in our final n=179 sample). The data was collected within 24 hours.</p><p>We then cleaned our data, performed outlier analysis and tested our assumptions (e.g. normality) for statistical examination of our hypothesis. We used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to examine the direct effects of our two independent variables (visual and data structures) on perceptions of group unity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Sampling</head><p>Our sampling was informed by our research design. We performed a power analysis with GPower 3.1 software in order to ensure a minimum power of 0.90 with moderate effect size for an ANCOVA analysis with df=5, suggesting a minimum total sample size as n=141. Our post-power of the completed study exceeded this minimum power for three dependent variables (close to 1 for all dependent variables, except centrality: 0.871).</p><p>We recruited 179 participants via AMT to achieve our minimum sample size of 35 per group. Given our scenario, to avoid language barriers and variance due to cultural differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, we limited participation to AMT workers registered in the U.S. We only accepted participants with a 75% or higher HIT approval rate and blocked participants from taking our study twice. Given our restrictions, we kept our HIT private, which means that all participants could see the HIT, but only qualifying participants could preview and accept it. In line with other research <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>[58] our sample is sufficiently diverse in terms of gender (61% male), age (75% of participants were in their 20ies or 30ies), education level (over 51% has completed a bachelor degree), income level (over 63% earn in the range of 20-59K), and household size (28% were single, 24% had a partner, and 31% had 1-2 dependents). Further, our participants were chart literate: 93% of participants answered correctly to our chart literacy question at the start of the study. Please see the Supporting Document for a tabular overview of our sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Measures and Descriptive Statistics</head><p>In this section, we describe our main measures used to statistically examine our hypotheses 1 and 2. There are two independent variables and four dependent variables. The independent variables are binary factors with two levels (our treatments), while the latter are compound constructs based on several multi-item scales. We also included control variables (compound constructs) that may affect perceived unity. We briefly describe each measure, before discussing the descriptive statistics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.1">Independent Variables</head><p>Our independent variables are visual stimuli (four different charts in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>) that define the distinct treatment groups to be compared in our statistical analysis. Factor 1 is the proximity in the visual structure (Level 1: low proximity, which refers to a visual structure with low spatial density of the data points visualized, and Level 2: high proximity where data points are densely organized). Factor 2 is the skewness in the behavioral data structure (Level 1: balanced or normally distributed data, and Level 2: skewed data).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.2">Dependent Variables</head><p>Based on previous literature, we developed and tested perceptual scales and use one visual scale that have all been used to measure group perception. Following prior studies, we used multi-item measures of similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, entitativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and rapport <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. For centrality we used a single visual response item that signals how much one belongs to the group <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Please see Supporting Document for semantic details used in the scales. Perceived similarity (.863 Cronbach's alpha) is measured with a six item semantic differential scale that sought to capture one's self-perceived similarity to other group members (e.g., are similar vs. are dissimilar) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> (see M=3.2058; SD=0.80224 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>).</p><p>Perceived entitativity (.867 Cronbach's alpha) is measured with a seven-item scale that tried to elicit whether participants perceive the group as an entity of its own rather than a group of many individual entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. We used 5-point semantic differentials (e.g., are cohesive vs. are not cohesive), which we compounded into arithmetic variables (M=3.0774; SD=0.79326; in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>).</p><p>Perceived rapport (.894 Cronbach's alpha) measured participants' perceived group rapport or harmony between group members <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. We captured responses on a 5-point six item semantic differential scale (e.g., agreement vs. disagreement). We compounded them into an arithmetic variable (M=3.0372; SD=0.9174 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>).</p><p>Perceived centrality is a single visual scale item with five ordinal centrality options from A to E (see this dependent variable listed 4 th in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> above) that measures user's selfcategorization into the perceived social group. It refers to how much they perceive that they belong into the group <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> (M=3.34; SD=0.906 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.3">Control Variables</head><p>We included six control variables that may have affected participants perception task in the social energy usage context. Three variables measure one's personality in terms of how cooperative, competitive and individualistic their behavioral tendencies are. To not overwhelm participants, we thinned the original personality scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> down from 22 items to nine items, where three items measured cooperative (.738 Cronbach's alpha; e.g., I like to help other people), another three competitive (.733 Cronbach's alpha; e.g., I like the challenge of seeing who is best), and last three users individualistic tendencies (.774 Cronbach's alpha; e.g. I work better when I do it all myself). On a 5-point Likert scale from Strongly Disagree to Strongly A gree, participants self-reported on how well the statements described them.</p><p>We also asked participants about their current energy conservation behaviours (e.g., Turning off the lights when not in use). Following Paco and Lavrador <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> we asked participants if they were doing the listed conservation actions already or not. If not, we asked if they consider it a hard or easy adoption to make. The 10-item scale had a Cronbach's alpha of .735.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.4">Dependent Variables</head><p>With high Cronbach's alphas the scales used to measure our constructs meet basic requirements of scale validity. We had more than two items that were compounded. As reported in detail above, we achieved Cronbach's alphas of &gt;.8 for our dependent variables, and &gt;.7 for our control variables. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> presents the basic descriptive information (means and standard deviations) of all measures (independent, dependent, and control). The measures meet the assumptions and requirements for ANCOVA: normality, random independent samples, homogeneity of variance, a linear relationship, and no outliers or multicollinearity <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. Correlation analysis (Pearson) was used to explore our variables before running an ANCOVA analysis. As expected, the correlation between our dependent measures is high (between .673 and .865 for perceived similarity, entitativity and rapport, but just .372 and .445 for centrality) and significant (p&lt;.01; twotailed). They are all measures of perceived group unity.</p><p>We chose to explore them individually, because literature on group identity has concluded their nuanced effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. There is a significant (p&lt;.05; two-tailed) correlation between the independent visual structure and dependent variables (between .282 and .401); while the correlation is low and mostly insignificant for data structure (between -.017 and .169). Data structure has a significant correlation with just perceived similarity (.169 at p&lt;.01 level; two-tailed).</p><p>The correlation between the control and dependent variables is low (between -.188 and .121) and insignificant (p&gt;.05; twotailed), with four exceptions where it is significant (p&lt;.05; twotailed): outdoor conservation has a low negative correlation with perceived entitativity (-.161) and perceived centrality (-.163). Competitive tendency has a low negative correlation with perceived rapport (-.182) and perceived centrality (-.188). Cooperative tendency has a low, but significant correlation with competitive tendency (.235) and moderately significant one with individualist tendency (-.390) at p&lt;.05 (two-tailed) level. Thus, we dropped individualistic tendency from our ANCOVA analysis to overcome issues of multicollinearity. The correlation table can be found in the Supporting Documentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RESULTS</head><p>We present the statistical analysis for our two hypotheses. We use the analysis of variance method to observe the effect of our two factors (treatments): Low versus high visual data proximity (factor 1), and balanced versus skewed data set (factor 2) on four dependent variables: similarity, entitativity, rapport, and centrality, that are all measures of perceived group unity.</p><p>We performed a full factorial design: We tested the effect of each independent variable on each of the four dependent variables, across all levels of the second independent variable and the control variable). We also included an interaction effect in order to examine the joint effect of proximity and skewness. The full results of our two-way between subjects ANCOVA is presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>All models were significant. The observed power is close to 1 for similarity, entitativity, and rapport. For perceived centrality the power is lower: .871. The adjusted R-square increased when we added the control and independent variables sequentially (e.g. R-square for similarity rose from .116 to .127), suggesting that the model improved as we added additional variables.</p><p>A closer look across the ANCOVA <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>  Below we present our results on hypothesis 1: the effect of data proximity on perceived group unity ( §4.1). Then, we examine the effect of data skewness (hypothesis 2) on perceived unity ( §4.2). We conclude the section with an analysis of the interaction effect between visual data proximity and the skewness of the underlying data set ( §4.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Proximal Visual Structure affects Perceptions of Group Unity</head><p>In our two-way between subjects ANCOVA (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>) we can see the effect of proximal visual structure in chart design on our four measures of perceived unity as the mean difference between the two levels: (1) low proximity (base chart) versus (2) high proximity (treatment chart). We found that proximal visual structure leads to a statistically significant difference between the mean values of all our compound constructs of perceived unity. Only our single item visual measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> for perceived centrality has a statistically insignificant effect. Proximity has a statistically significant effect on perceived similarity at the p&lt;.001 level for [F(5,173)=14.58, p&lt;.001]. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref>, we present estimated marginal means of perceived similarity for high proximity (est. mean of 3.42) treatment group versus low proximity base chart (estimated mean of 2.99). With a notable significant difference in means, we conclude that increasing the density of data points in a chart may increase perceptions of group members being similar to one another. This result may complement previous studies that have found little evidence to graphics (vs. basic charts) leading to higher levels of user empathy and prosocial behavior toward the people the visualization represents <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>.</p><p>When moving to the second column in the ANCOVA <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>, we see that proximity also has a significant effect on perceived entitativity at the p&lt;.001 level for [F(5,173)=21.344, p&lt;.001]. The second pair from top in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref> presents the estimated marginal means of perceived entitativity for high proximity (est. mean of 3.34) versus low proximity (estimated mean of 2.82). We reject the H0 of equal means between low and high proximity, and conclude that proximally placed data points in a chart depicting social data may lead to increased perceptions of entitative social groups. This is in line with past findings that showed how proportions influence people's decisions to save suffering others, when the items at risk are construed to form groups, as opposed to distinct individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>.</p><p>In the third column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>, we also observe that proximity has a statistically significant effect on perceived rapport at the p&lt;.001 level for [F(5,173)=34.91, p&lt;.001]. The major difference in the estimated marginal means between perceived rapport for high proximity (est. mean of 3.401) and low proximity (estimated mean of 2.675) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7)</ref> suggests that the effect is particularly strong for perceived rapport. We conclude that proximally placed data points in a group chart can increase the perceptions of rapport regarding group tasks. The mean difference is highest for rapport.</p><p>Forth, the significance level for perceived centrality was only at p=.055 level. This makes it difficult to justify that proximity can also increase perceptions of centrality. A closer look into <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref> shows that the estimated mean difference is also rather small (est. mean=3.421 for high proximity versus estimated mean of 3.213 for low proximity).  : Based on 2x2 factorial design (n=179) we estimate the main effect of Proximity (factor 1), across factor 2 (skewness) and control variables. Here we present the estimated marginal means and 95% confidence intervals for Proximity (factor 1) for each of our four measures of perceived unity. Note: **p&lt;.01; (*)p&lt;.055.</p><p>We also ran a MANCOVA, where the Pillal's Trace suggested that 19.1% of the variance in the dependent variables can be explained by the treatment (i.e., the visual structure) at the p&lt;.001 level for similarity, entitativity and rapport. The significance level for perceived centrality is only p=.057. Visual structure of proximity leads to significantly different perceptions of similarity, entitativity and rapport. With 7% of variance explainable by data structure, it can lead to significantly different perceptions of group similarity, and rapport (not group entitativity or centrality).</p><p>In summary, our findings support our hypothesis 1 that if proximity is high in the visual structure of a social data chart this leads to significantly higher perceived unity compared to charts where proximity is low, across all conditions of skewness (since we run 2 x 2 ANCOVA and presented the main effects across all other conditions). Interestingly, this effect by proximity varies between the four different measures of perceived unity. The effect is stronger for rapport and entitativity compared to similarity. This is in line with prior findings that visual structures can create unique visual metaphors <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">The Direct Effect of Skewness on Perceived Unity is Limited</head><p>Next, we examine the results for our second hypothesis about data skewness levels and its effect on perceived unity. Our <ref type="table">Table with</ref> two-way between subjects ANCOVAs <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 2)</ref> provides immediate insights into the effect that skewness does not play much of a role for perceptions of group unity. From among the four measures of perceived group unity, only one had a significant effect on perceived similarity. The effect was not significant for the other three measures: entitativity, rapport, and centrality. A level change in the factor for the measure of perceived similarity leads to a significant difference in the means of perceived similarity [F(5,173)=5.084, p&lt;.001] (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>). The <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>: Based on 2x2 factorial design (n=179) we estimate the main effect of Proximity (factor 1), across factor 2 (skewness) and control variables. Here we present the estimated marginal means and 95% confidence intervals for Proximity (factor 1) for each of our four measures of perceived unity. Note: **p&lt;.01; (*)p&lt;.055.</p><p>estimated marginal means and confidence intervals differ between the two factor levels (balanced versus skewed) (see <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). The estimated marginal means for skewed data structures is 3.078 compared to a mean of 3.332 for charts where the data set is balanced. As hypothesized, we concluded that skewed data leads to increased perceptions of group member dissimilarity; however, it is somewhat surprising that we failed to observe similar results for the three other perceived group unity measures. We accept the H0 of no mean difference for entitativity, rapport, and centrality.</p><p>We shall discuss what this might mean for social visualizations, in particular.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">The Moderating Effect of Skewness on Proximity</head><p>Finally, we also examined the interaction effect between the two factors: visual proximity and data skewness. Our two-way between subjects ANCOVAs <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 2)</ref> show that there is a significant interaction effect between the two factors at the p&lt;.05 level. We found significant interaction effects on rapport [F <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr">173)</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref> presents these interaction effects visually.</p><p>These results suggest that a balanced data set can amplify the effect of proximally visualized social data on perceived rapport (perceived harmony among the group members) and perceived centrality (ones belonging to the visualized group) between the group members represented in the chart. Or stated differently, skewness in the data structure can weaken the effect of high proximity on perceived unity. This finding is somewhat unexpected in light of past finding where densely populated charts would be deemed similar irrespective of their data orientation or distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Next, we discuss how our findings contribute to existing InfoVis literature. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>This study was motivated with a goal in mind: to examine how two properties of a chart (1) proximity in the visual structure (or spatial data density) and (2) skewness of the numerical data structure (or statistical data distribution) affect perceived unity in social data visualizations: visualizations that are used to communicate data-intensive information to humans participating in social tasks that suffer from social dilemmas like social loafing and free-riding <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>[62] <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. In our perceptual experiments, we empirically disentangle the effect of perceptual cues created by these two properties on human's perception of group unity, that is the social semantics inferred by the human when perceiving the chart <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>[11] <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</p><p>Our study makes three important findings. First, proximity in the visual structure, when applied to social data charts, creates cues that assign social semantics of unity across all conditions of skewness. Surprisingly though, skewness has a negative main effect only on perceived similarity. Second, we learn that the strong effect of proximity on how we perceive social data interacts with skewness in a non-linear way. Greater balance amplifies the effect of proximity on perceived rapport ("harmony") and perceived centrality ("ones belonging to the group"), but skewness weakens this meaning created and leads to less rapport ("harmony") and centrality ("belonging"). Third, we find that the stable semantic meanings 'construed' by proximity are entitativity and similarity, irrespective of skewness. These findings contribute to two streams of literature in information visualization: perceptual InfoVis, and social InfoVis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Contribution to Perception in InfoVis</head><p>First, this study contributes to the InfoVis research concerned with the broader question of how visual cues used in data visualizations affect perceptual processes, and eventually human perceptual and cognitive performance (e.g. insight, accuracy, time) <ref type="bibr">[</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. Our study makes three contributions to this stream. First, we extend prior work focused on visual structures and the mechanisms of how they mediate human sense making processes. This stream of work has shown that the visual structure of data charts, that is the way the data points are spatially organizedaffects what conceptual meaning we assign to the numerical data. For instance, prior work has used theoretical arguments of visual 'metaphors' to explain how visual structures affect users ability to correctly interpret data <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. This stream of work may incorporate some insights of our study: We find that different combinations of a certain visual structure (in our case proximity) and a particular data structure (in our case skewness) lead to a particular semantic responses. Under some conditions semantic meaning is modified by the data structure, and in other conditions it is not. While some perceptual responses to proximity (as a property of the visual chart structure) are stable irrespective of the data structure (e.g. entitativity in the sense of perceived 'oneness') others are sensitive to skewness in the data structure (e.g. rapport in the sense of perceived harmony or centrality that refers to perceived belonging to a group). We hope that InfoVis scholars will take this finding further and examine, in more detail, the unique configurations of visual and data structures and the particular human semantic responses to them.</p><p>Second, we contribute to the perceptual work in InfoVis specifically concerned with data density as a global visual property (in our case called proximity) and its effect on perception. Specifically, we explain in greater nuances how data density interacts with the numerical data structure during a perceptual task. Prior studies already suggest that the effect of density is very strong and may mediate how humans interpret the underlying numerical data structure. For example, when users are asked to group similar scatterplots, the scatterplots with high overall density tend to be grouped as similar charts even if they varied in terms of the statistical distribution of the data (data spread) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Our findings; however, suggest that the strong effect of density may not sustain if we vary the statistical distribution of the data (in our case skewness). Using controlled experiments with the same task setting and varying both proximity as well as skewness, we find that proximity in the visual structure (density) and skewness interact in nonlinear ways in affecting perception. The statistical property of the data structure negatively moderates the effect of proximity (density). Thus, we suggest that perceptual InfoVis scholars may further deepen our understanding of how data point density in charts affects human perception and consecutive action. We call for controlled experiments, where the perceptual task is constant, while visual structure and the distribution of the visualized data is varied across a large parameter space (beyond what we have managed to cover in this paper).</p><p>Third, our study contributes to the priming work in perceptual InfoVis research. For example, informed by perceptual psychology that showed how emotional changes can impact people's cognitive tasks performance, past priming studies have shown how affective priming via text-based stories in the New York Times website (to keep verbal and visual memory separate in a graphical perception task) ahead of users interacting with a visualization can affect users visual judgments, cognitive accuracy and how they interpret the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. Our findings on the 'priming effect' of proximity suggest that such priming studies should consider the role of the visual structures of charts as visual primers itself. In our particular case, the visual structure functions as a social primer for group identification that creates social meanings. This suggests, that the visual structure guides how we interpret the numeric values depicted in a chart. Thus, future research should examine these two priming effects jointly -a priori affective and in-visualization priming cues -in order to understand how they affect visual perception of charts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Contribution to Social InfoVis</head><p>Our study also contributes to more recent stream of work on social InfoVis, concerned with the question of how social cues in visualizations affect human's perceptual as well as motivational processes when participating in a social task that require individuals to act collectively rather than individualistically <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> [43][73] <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[74]</ref>. In this emerging stream, we make two important contributions. First, we contribute to the ambivalent discourse on the effect of visual cues for social comparison processes, that is, visualizations that allow users to compare oneself with other group members. Indeed, prior studies suggest that if visualizations allow a human to compare his or her own behavior (and performance) with the behavior of their peers this has a positive effect on awareness and recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>[74], but not necessarily on the members' motivation to participate in the group's goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Our study provides more nuanced insights on the effect of visual cues for social comparison created through the numeric data structure (skewness) and show that skewness may or may not carry negative social meanings depending on the facets of social perceptions under consideration: Skewness mediates whether humans perceive social data about a group as being similar. However, skewness does not directly affect perceptions of rapport (harmony), entitativity (oneness or cohesion) and centrality (belong to the group). This is somewhat surprising. However, our findings show that the response to skewness unfolds more indirectly.</p><p>Skewness in data can weaken the positive effect of proximity on perceptions of rapport (harmony) and centrality (belong to the group). Proximal visual structure and data skewness interact in non-linear ways: Affecting whether people derive positive or negative social meanings about the group's unity. If data balance and the proximity of the visual structure are high, the perceptual outcome on perceived group unity is greatest. However, skewness may also create opposing negative forces and dampen the positive unifying effect of the proximal visual chart structure (data point density). How these joint effects play out depends on different social meanings of group identity. The effect of proximity on entitativity (acting in unison) is insensitive to skewness, while rapport (harmony between members) and centrality (selfidentification with the group) are sensitive to skewness. Social InfoVis literature may incorporate those findings in examining the joint effect of proximity and skewness in social data visualizations even further.</p><p>Second, our findings also extend the discourse on the role of social data visualization for prosocial behavior and perceptual empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. This stream of work has found that the global visual structure of a chart influences whether and how humans establish empathy with others. More specifically, this work may incorporate Gestalt laws and the concept of proximity in social data visualization in order to refine their existing explanations of how social data visualizations affect human's prosocial responses. Visual structures that create social union may in fact help prime users to feel socially cohesive with the suffering others (i.e. "I could be in their shoes") and result in different levels of empathy and prosocial behavior.</p><p>Our most important takeaway for the social InfoVis research is as follows: Visual structure of proximity creates member traitrelated information cues in social data charts <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Proximally framed data charts may frame individual's perceptions and choices in a social dilemma setting to be more sustainable, like our setting of energy conservation. Further, our work suggests that proximity and skewness interact. Their interaction cannot be ignored, because it can unfold in a positive as well as negative way depending on the semantic attributes of perceived unity: If there is behavioural 'imbalance' (or skewness) and little outliers, the effect of proximity on perceived rapport (harmony between the group members) is weakened. Interestingly, it does not come to bear for entitativity (acting in unison). These nuances warrant further research to inform future efforts to design data feedback charts that effectively motivate individuals to participate in joint efforts and overcome societal challenges.</p><p>In sum, we find that proximity, as property of the visual structure, will lead to greater perceptions of entitativity. As such, entitativity is particularly important in social settings of groups that are exposed to problems of social loafing. We hope that social InfoVis scholars take these findings further and examine the actual behavioural implications of social data charts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">FUTURE WORK AND LIMITATIONS</head><p>This work is not without limitations and sets the path for future work on visual structures in social data charts among InfoVis scholars. Future work should extend our work in three ways:</p><p>First, we suggest that InfoVis scholars may explore in greater detail how both the global visual structure (or colloquially speaking the chart appearance) and the numerical data structure affect the sense making process. To better understand how visual structures affect our perceptions online experiments should be complemented with perceptual group studies in the lab that use eye tracking and think aloud techniques to capture the immediate perceptual responses of individuals in a group.</p><p>Second, our visualizations were focused only on one aspect of the global visual structure that is essential to create socially unifying interpretations: proximity. However, Gestalt laws suggest other visual structures that can create additional important visual cues that InfoVis scholars may incorporate in their studies on visual structures affecting the unity of social perceptions. For example, the law of continuation may affects charts like line, sanky or steam charts; or, the law of enclosure might affect social perceptions of network charts <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Third, we argue that future studies of social InfoVis should examine the joint effect of proximal visual structure and data skewness further and study the effect on other perceptual and also behavioural responses. For example, we invite scholars to examine in greater detail how proximity not only primes perceptual responses of unity but also whether such priming effects can lead to increased participation in group tasks with varying participation efforts and scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. It would be highly impactful to find support to the potential role visual chart structures can play as social psychological primers in helping sustain cooperative team or community behaviours. To test whether novel forms of group data visualizations can overcome the problem of social loafing future studies will need to explore this in group game studies (e.g., public good games).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Our theoretical model</figDesc></figure>
