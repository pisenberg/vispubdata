				<p>Fig. 1. The initial, interactive symmetric dual projections of a multidimensional dataset using SIRIUS. Observations (animals) are projected in the left panel, while attributes (animal characteristics) are projected in the right panel. Both panels project similar items closer together based on a weighted high-dimensional distance function in which the weights reflect a conceptual notion of &quot;importance.&quot; These weights are reflected by the node sizes and opacities in the opposing panel. For example, Quadrupedal has a higher weight in the left projection of animals, and Tiger has a slightly higher weight in the right projection of characteristics.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Visualizing and interacting with high-dimensional data for exploratory data analysis is an open research area with many facets to explore. In this paper, we focus on visual analytics techniques for high-dimensional data exploration that use dimension reduction to project 2D scatterplots of the data. Many existing techniques and interactions therein focus on observation-centric tasks that reveal relationships between observations as defined by their attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> , such as clustering tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. For example, with the animal dataset used throughout this paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, analysts could investigate questions such as "Which attributes separate the Tiger and Wolf from the Blue Whale and Dolphin?" or "What other animals are similar to those animal groups?" Projection methods often define weight parameters on the attributes that enable analysts to assign different levels of importance to each attribute, thus enabling exploration of alternative observation projections <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>.</p><p>Likewise, there are complementary attribute-centric tasks that reveal relationships between attributes as defined by their observations, such as correlation tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. For example, a follow-up question might be "What other attributes are correlated with the attributes that separate these two groups?" This question is more difficult to answer with observation-centric projections. Thus, other kinds of visualizations are often used, such as linked distribution plots and dynamic queries <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47]</ref> or correlation matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, creating asymmetry in how observation-centric and attribute-centric tasks are supported.</p><p>A natural symmetry between observation-centric and attributecentric tasks in high-dimensional data can be defined as equivalent tasks on the data table or data matrix and its transpose (which swaps the observations and attributes). For example, this symmetry often arises in visualizations for text analytics. With a vector space model matrix, documents can be projected in terms of their word usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Alternatively, with the matrix transpose, words can be projected in terms of their usage in documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. We propose that this task symmetry between observations and attributes reflects a symmetry in the cognition of multidimensional data, and therefore is better supported by a symmetry between how the observations and attributes are visualized and interacted with. Such a symmetry would give analysts equal power to investigate both observations and attributes, using the same visual representations and interactions for both. Additionally, previous work has shown cognitive bias towards symmetric stimuli, as well as an association between asymmetry and disgust <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Based on this, we assert that asymmetric visualization and interaction design should increase cognitive load in comparison to symmetric designs as they require analysts to simultaneously interpret different approaches to observations and attributes.</p><p>To address this need for symmetry, we define a symmetric dual projection technique in which the projection of observations is defined by the attributes, and the projection of attributes is defined by the observations. We further define interactions that connect the observations and attributes between the symmetric projections, resulting in a manipulation of the projection of observations influencing the projection of the attributes and vice versa. These interactions reflect a notion of a deep connection between the observations and the attributes that mirrors the analyst's notion of how observations and attributes are interconnected.</p><p>Specifically, our contributions in this work are:</p><p>1. Defining a technique for symmetric, interconnected projections of observations and attributes to directly address the lack of symmetry in current visual analytics techniques (detailed in Sect. 3).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Here, we provide a brief survey of interactive visual analytics techniques for exploratory data analysis with high-dimensional data to highlight a lack of connection and symmetry between observations and attributes. We directly address this limitation via SIRIUS. In the following discussion, we refer to visualizations as simplistic if they do not incorporate many dimensions, and interactions as simplistic if they result in a trivial interpretation to change a mathematical model used to process or visualize the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Displaying and Interacting with Attributes</head><p>The attributes of high-dimensional data are visualized using a variety of techniques, ranging from simplistic (e.g., a raw data table or data matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>) to more complex and informative (e.g., MDS projections <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50]</ref> or PCA (Principal Component Analysis) projections <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">59]</ref>). In most cases, attribute visualizations implement a more simplistic technique like visual encodings such as color <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58]</ref>, size <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>, or labels <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. Another method is to show the attribute values for observations along a one-dimensional line <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. Individual axes in parallel coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54]</ref> create a similar visualization of attributes. As the complexity of the visualizations grow, we begin to see visualizations capable of conveying more information, such as scatterplots <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>, histograms <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, heatmaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54]</ref>, and polar coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">56]</ref>. Some visualizations implement a specific method for conveying information with this level of complexity, such as the arrows used by Brown <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, representing attributes as "magnetic" nodes that pull on observation nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57]</ref>, and the "Axis Rainbow" in AxiSketcher <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The most complex examples of visualizations for attributes include the aforementioned MDS and PCA projections.</p><p>Interactions with the attributes tend to also be more simplistic. For techniques that map an individual attribute to an axis, the axis can be enlarged, shrunk, or rotated to alter how the given attribute influences the visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. Another method for altering the visualization of the attributes is to change the color mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. To see data associated with a particular attribute, analysts can sometimes hover over or click on nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. Brushing and linking can also be used to highlight attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58]</ref>. Searching mechanisms allow new attributes to be added to the visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, while sorting enable analysts to easily find specific attributes easily <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Some techniques also support clustering of attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58]</ref>. With respect to attributes, there are few examples of more complex interactions, such as dragging the attribute nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57]</ref>, the focus and context interactions described by Turkay et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>, the update features described by Brown <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and altering the attribute values in the aster plot in AxiSketcher <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. These types of interactions adjust the underlying visualization mechanisms to update the visualization itself based on the analyst's interaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Displaying and Interacting with Observations</head><p>Visualization techniques used to display the observations of highdimensional data also range widely in complexity, but they tend to be more complex in comparison to those used to display the attributes. The least complex of these are raw data <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, color <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58]</ref>, size <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and lists <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Increasing in complexity, we again see visualizations like heatmaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> as well as frequency plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, dendrograms <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, and scatterplots <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49]</ref>. Many visualizations for observations attempt to incorporate all the attributes explicitly in visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57]</ref>. Examples of implicitly including all attributes can be seen in scatterplot-like projections of the data (e.g., MDS projections <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>, PCA projections <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58]</ref>, t-SNE <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and force-directed layouts <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52]</ref>).</p><p>Similarly, the interactions on the observations tend towards more complex interactions. Simplistic interactions include hovering or clicking on representations of observations to see the associated data <ref type="bibr">[6-8, 22, 25, 35, 43, 52]</ref> and altering how color is mapped in the visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. Common, but still simple, interactions such as filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58]</ref>, searching <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54]</ref>, and brushing and linking <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58]</ref> are often included. However, many visualizations for the observations enable direct manipulation of the visualization itself, such as how the attributes are used for the axes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, manipulating the projection to alter an underlying mathematical model <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>, selecting the clustering algorithm used or at what level clustering occurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58]</ref>, manipulating how different attributes influence the visualization of the observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57]</ref>, drawing lines through the visualization to redefine the axes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, and using a lens to separate groups of observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Projecting Attributes and Observations</head><p>Although at first glance it may appear that techniques such as the Data Context Map <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Dimension Projection Matrix/Tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref>, and the visualization defined by Turkay et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref> provide symmetry in how observations and attributes are visualized and interacted with, there are important differences in their visualization methods, interaction methods, or both. In the Data Context Map <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, observations and attributes are plotted in the same MDS projection. Such a projection enables insights regarding similarity-based relationships between observations and attributes while contextualizing the projection of the observations. However, the tradeoff is that this technique necessarily distorts either the projection of the observations, the attributes, or both. This distortion is caused by the fact that each additional piece of data plotted in an MDS projection influences the projection of all other data. Therefore, the observations and/or attributes can appear more or less similar than what they actually are. Furthermore, the interactions for the Data Context Map focus on drawing contours around observations based on ranges of attribute values; there is no interaction to draw contours based on ranges of observations.</p><p>As for the Dimension Projection Matrix/Tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref>, both observations and attributes are visualized using PCA projections. However, the observation projection can be split into multiple projections based on specific subsets of attributes, whereas the attribute projection always remains a single projection. Additionally, the projections of the observations are given colored axes based on their corresponding subset of attributes; such information about the observations is not provided in the attribute projection. Thus, while this visualization and the interactions therein enable exploration of how attribute subspaces affect projections of the observations, the obvious tradeoff in this technique is that such exploration of observation subspaces is not supported.</p><p>Lastly, the visualization by Turkay et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref> provides three scatterplots: one for observations using one attribute for each axis, an observation projection using two principal components, and one visualizing attributes using their mean and standard deviation. Despite observations and attributes being displayed in separate scatterplots, the manner in which each portrays information is inherently different, meaning these projections do not have a strong symmetry. Additionally, interactions include brushing and linking between observations selected in the first scatrerplot and associated data in the other two scatterplots as well as focus and context interactions based on selected attributes in the attribute scatterplot. Thus, the interactions for observations are very different than those for attributes, creating further disparity between observations and attributes. Therefore, while this visualization technique enables deep exploration of the observations, the tradeoff is that such exploration for attributes is not well-supported.</p><p>Given the above discussion, attributes are generally treated very differently than observations, yet many tasks that analysts have regarding attributes are symmetrically similar to those regarding observations. Therefore, there is an opportunity to explore a new part of the design space of semantic interaction in visual analytics in which observations and attributes are displayed and interacted with in a symmetric and interconnected manner. Thus, we propose a new, symmetric exploratory data analysis technique for visualizing and interacting with both observations and attributes of high-dimensional data called SIRIUS, detailed in the next section. An example implementation is described in Sect. 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">SIRIUS: A TECHNIQUE FOR SYMMETRIC, INTERACTIVE PROJECTIONS OF OBSERVATIONS AND ATTRIBUTES</head><p>To enable exploratory data analysis with high-dimensional data using symmetric visualization and interaction techniques between the attributes and observations, we designed a new technique called SIR-IUS (Symmetric Interactive Representations In a Unified System). We assert that in SIRIUS the analyst must be able to:</p><p>Goal 1: View similarity-based relationships between observations and similarity-based relationships between attributes of highdimensional data. Goal 2: Explore different projections of the data by altering the importance of specific observations or attributes. Goal 3: Understand how importances of observations affect the importances of attributes and vice versa.</p><p>Each of these goals are further described in the following subsections. To clearly exemplify these concepts, we use a subset of the animal dataset from Lampert et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> containing 13 observations and 13 attributes. These observations and attributes were selected to provide a clear and intuitive example (e.g., by excluding attributes like Newworld) while ensuring variance (e.g., by only including Horse and not Zebra). More complex examples are presented in Sect. 5. Variables and functions are defined in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Goal 1: Visualize Similarity-Based Relationships</head><p>This first goal combines the tasks of seeing similarities between observations and seeing similarities between attributes. For example, in the animal dataset where the observations are animals, the German Shepherd is similar to the Wolf but not very similar to the Elephant. These similarities between the observations can be visually represented via a projection method. There are many different methods of doing so, including but not limited to PCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53]</ref>, t-SNE <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>, and MDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48]</ref>. We generalize the lower-dimension projection of the observations to be the output of the function pro ject O :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">O = pro ject O (wDist O )</formula><p>Similarly, an additional projection method should enable analysts to see similarities between attributes. For example, in the animal dataset, the attribute Strength is more similar to the attribute Size than to Grazer. We generalize the lower-dimension projection of the attributes to be the output of a function, pro ject A , as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A = pro ject A (wDist A )</formula><p>As noted in our evaluation of the Data Context Map <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> in Sect. 2.3, visualizing the observations and the attributes in a single projection necessarily distorts the projection of the similarities between observations, attributes, or both. Thus, the observations and attributes must be projected into separate spaces to maintain an accurate representation of their similarities. This means we need two similarity-based projections: one for observations (pro ject O ) and one for attributes (pro ject A ).</p><p>Furthermore, to reduce confusion between the two projections, we propose that pro ject O and pro ject A should produce projections that are understood in the same manner by the analyst. This is best reflected by a symmetry in the manner in which observations and attributes are visualized (and later interacted with). The easiest way to accomplish this is to use the same projection method for both pro ject O and pro ject A (e.g., MDS), but they can differ if the analyst perceives them in the same manner (e.g., MDS and PCA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Goal 2: Explore Different Projections</head><p>Exploring different projections stems from the need to gain new insights based on domain knowledge or a hypothesis, or for general exploratory analysis. These insights can be gained by redefining the similarity between observations or attributes, which implies interaction that alters at least one projection. Such interaction can be accomplished by either altering the parameters that generate the high-dimensional pairwise distances or by directly manipulating the projection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Explore Projections of Observations</head><p>To exemplify what is meant by each of these interaction methods, we first focus on pro ject O . From a projection of the observations, the analyst may want to understand how placing more importance on different attributes affects the similarities between the observations. For example, the analyst may want to investigate how animals differ based on their Water attribute. By placing more importance on this one attribute, animals like Otter should be reprojected much closer to the Dolphin and Blue Whale and farther away from the Siamese Cat.</p><p>Alternatively, the analyst may want to see how altering similarities between observations influences the level of importance that should be placed on each attribute. For example, if the analyst drags nodes for Dolphin and Blue Whale in one corner of the animal projection (to denote their desired similarity) and Elephant to the opposite corner (to denote its desired difference from the other two animals), the technique should reflect a higher level of importance for attributes that describe the differences between these two groups. In this case, the Walks and Grazer attributes describe the differences between these two groups, implying they should be given higher levels of importance.</p><p>In both of these types of interactions within the observation projection, the importances of attributes are altered. This reflects the fact that observations are understood based on their attributes. Given that the importance of attributes can be represented by weights on the attributes, the similarity between two observations, O i and O j , can be generalized with the following weighted high-dimensional distance function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">wDist O i, j = hDist O (W A , O i , O j )</formula><p>There are many weighted distance functions that could be used here, such as weighted variants of Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, cosine distance, Gower distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, Pearson coefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Which distance function to use is often determined by the tasks supported and data used, however it must be compatible with the chosen projection method and desired outcome of the projection itself. For example, while PCA can be used to accomplish Goal 1, it emphasizes variance rather than strictly pairwise distances. Thus, using a weighted Euclidean distance with PCA may not produce the desired results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Explore Projections of Attributes</head><p>To maintain the desired symmetry with the observations, the same interactions are enabled in the projection of the attributes. Thus, the analyst can alter the importance of a specific observation to understand how this affects the similarities between attributes. For example, increasing the importance for Cow should result in attributes like Walks, Size, and Strength being placed closer together but far away from Stripes. Additionally, the analyst can alter the similarities between attributes to understand how the importances of observations are affected. For instance, if the analyst drags nodes for Grazer and Size to one corner of the projection and Water to another, Horse describes the differences between these two groups of attributes and should therefore receive a higher weight to denote its increased importance.</p><p>In both of these types of interactions within the attribute projection, the importances of observations are altered. This reflects the fact that attributes are understood based on the observations. Since the importance <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Goal 3: Relate Importances to Each Other</head><p>As stated previously, the analyst understands the observations based on their attributes and vice versa. This hints at a connectedness between the observations and the attributes themselves. In the equations in the previous subsection, this connectedness is initiated by the importance of the attributes affecting the similarity of the observations and the importance of the observations affecting the similarity of the attributes. However, the notion of interconnectedness goes beyond these equations: attributes that are given more importance indicate which observations should be given more importance and vice versa.</p><p>As a common example of this, a keyword search for relevant documents results in those keywords (i.e., attributes of documents) being given a high level of importance. This means that documents that are better described by those keywords are, in turn, more important as well, and hence should be returned in the query results. This example implies that observations that have higher values (e.g., keyword frequencies) for an attribute are more important, and vice versa.</p><p>Using the animal dataset again to exemplify this, increasing the importance of the Water attribute should result in animals like Dolphin, Blue Whale, and Otter also being given a high level of importance in addition to reprojecting their nodes closer together. Siamese Cat, on the other hand, should have a low level of importance as it is not well described by the Water attribute. However, these updated importances for the different animals also denote which attributes should be considered important, beyond the single Water attribute that was interacted with. This means that given important animals like Dolphin, Blue Whale, and Otter, attributes like Speed, Active, and Smart are also more important than other attributes that do not describe these animals as well.</p><p>Therefore, the importance of attributes should affect the importance of observations and vice versa to reflect the analyst's notion of the interconnectedness between the attributes and the observations. This can be accomplished with the following equations, where Imp O and Imp A compute the importance for one observation or attribute, respectively:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">W O i = Imp O (O i ,W A ) W A i = Imp A (A i ,W O )</formula><p>This interconnectedness between the importances of the observations and the importances of the attributes enables a new visual analytics technique that not treats the observations and the attributes in a symmetric manner while enabling rich interaction between both projections.</p><p>Given this interconnectedness in SIRIUS, the weights that reflect the importances of observations and attributes are crucial components of the technique. They are used to project the data via weighted highdimensional distance functions to explore different projections and to relate the importances of observations and attributes to each other. We demonstrate how this can be accomplished in Sect. 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">AN IMPLEMENTATION OF SIRIUS</head><p>The generalized SIRIUS technique above supports a design space of possible projection methods, distance functions, and interaction methods that can be inserted. We present a particular implementation of SIRIUS that addresses the goals of Sect. 3 in the following manner:</p><p>1. Using WMDS for both pro ject O and pro ject A , and weighted Euclidean distance for hDist O and hDist A , to create both a projection of the observations and a projection of the attributes. 2. Using the notions of parametric interactions (which we call PaI) and observation-level interactions described by Self et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> to manipulate the weights W O and W A of the weighted Euclidean distance function. Since we use the concept of observation-level interactions in both the observation projection and the attribute projection, we have renamed observation-level interactions as projection interactions (PrI) to reduce any potential confusion 2 . 3. Relating the importances of observations and attributes to each other by defining Imp O and Imp A as a dot product between the original data matrix or its transpose and a set of attribute weights or observations weights (respectively). Ultimately, these equations for importance result in interconnecting both projections by using an interaction in one projection to alter both projections.</p><p>We made these particular design choices based on previous research in visualizing and interacting with high-dimensional data <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52]</ref>. However, these are not strict constraints; any distance function, projection method, or interaction method that properly address the goals defined in Sect. 3 may be used in place of our choices here.</p><p>The following subsections describe how we accomplished each goal in detail, using the same subset of the animal dataset from the previous section to exemplify each concept.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Goal 1: Visualize Similarity-Based Relationships 4.1.1 Observation Projection</head><p>In SIRIUS, the left projection is designed to depict similarities between observations. To visualize these similarities, we use weighted Euclidean distance in WMDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, as defined by the following equation: <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. An initial projection of a subset of the animal dataset using SIRIUS, which maps "importance" to node size and opacity to provide a deeper semantic connection between observations and attributes. This allows analysts to determine at a glance which animals best describe the attribute projection (from the observation panel) and which attributes best describe the animal projection (from the attribute panel).</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">O = arg min O 1 ,...,Ô n n−1 ∑ i=1 n ∑ j&gt;i lDist(Ô i ,Ô j ) − hDist O (W A , O i , O j ) 2 (1)</formula><p>Before the data can be projected, some preprocessing must occur. To overcome any potential distortions in the projection caused by attribute values on different scales, O is z-score normalized prior to visualization.</p><p>Additionally, a set of attribute weights, W A , that reflect the importances of each of the attributes must be defined before the highdimensional distance matrix can be calculated. W A has two constraints: 0 ≤ W A i ≤ 1 and ∑ i W A i = 1. Thus, weights are interpreted as proportions of the analyst's interest in each attribute (i.e., its level of importance). Although this is a minor point in the initialization of SIRIUS, it greatly affects the interaction methods, as discussed in the following subsections. For now, we will say that W A is initialized by determining the importances of the attributes, with details discussed in Sect. 4.3. The initial observation projection is shown in the left panel in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>, which accurately shows that German Shepherd and Wolf are more similar to each other than to the Elephant as desired.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Attribute Projection</head><p>Given the desire for symmetry between the observations and the attributes, a second projection is used to depict the similarities between the attributes. It also uses weighted Euclidean distance in WMDS, as defined in the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">A = arg min A 1 ,...,Â p p−1 ∑ i=1 p ∑ j&gt;i lDist(Â i ,Â j ) − hDist A (W O , A i , A j ) 2 (2)</formula><p>Again, the data must be preprocessed before it can be projected. This includes z-score normalizing A, as well as initializing an observation weight vector, W O . These weights reflect the importances of each observation and must hold to the same two constraints as W A . We again leave detailed discussion for how we initialize this set of weights for Sect. 4.3. This initial projection is shown in the right panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>, which demonstrates that Strength and Size are more similar to each other than to Grazer, as desired.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Goal 2: Explore Different Projections</head><p>In SIRIUS, we use weighted Euclidean distance to define both the similarities between observations and the similarities between attributes. Thus, exploration of different projections is accomplished by manipulating the associated weights, thereby allowing the use of PaI and PrI as described by Self et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> to enable rich interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Parametric Interaction (PaI)</head><p>To explore how attribute importances affect similarities between observations, PaI is enabled via an "Importance" slider, which is accessible by clicking a node in the attribute projection. The analyst can alter the attribute weight (i.e., importance) by manipulating the slider. During this interaction, all attribute weights are re-normalized to adhere to the previously described sum-to-1 and 0-to-1 constraints. The change in attribute weights is reflected in updates to the size and opacity of the attribute nodes, which visually reflects their importance. All observations are then reprojected using Equation 1 with the updated attribute weights to show the effect of the analyst's interaction. An example of PaI on the Water attribute is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3</ref>-A, which pulls Otter closer to the Dolphin and Blue Whale than to the Siamese Cat.</p><p>Symmetrically, PaI is also used to explore how observation importance affects similarities between attributes via the same "Importance" slider. The analyst can click an observation and adjust the slider to alter the weight (i.e., importance) for the given observation, and all observation weights are re-normalized. The size and opacity of the observation nodes are updated to reflect their new weights. All attributes are then reprojected using the updated observation weights in Equation 2. An example of PaI on the Cow observation is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3-B</ref>, which correctly results in the Walks, Size, and Strength attributes being placed close together but far apart from the Stripes attribute to reflect their similarity in "cow-ness."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Projection Interaction (PrI)</head><p>To explore how observation similarities affect attribute importances, analysts can use PrI in the observation projection. This is accomplished by directly manipulating the observation projection via clicking and dragging observation nodes of interest to redefine their relative similarities. Once the analyst is done manipulating the projection, an "Update Layout" button above the observation panel is clicked. This triggers a semi-supervised re-learning of the attribute weights using only the observation nodes the analyst interacted with,Ô * , in the following optimization, essentially inverting the WMDS process in Equation 1:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">W A = arg min W A 1 ,...,W Ap ∑ i∈Ô * ∑ j∈Ô * lDist(Ô * i ,Ô * j ) − hDist O (W A , O i , O j ) 2<label>(3)</label></formula><p>This optimization must also adhere to the sum to 1 and 0 to 1 constraints for W A . From the new attribute weights, the attribute node sizes and opacities are updated to reflect these new levels of importance, and Equation 1 is re-executed to reproject all observations. For example, as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3</ref>-C, dragging the nodes for Dolphin and Blue Whale to one corner of the projection and Elephant to the opposite corner, results in an increase in the importances of the Walks and Grazer attributes, which distinguish these two groups of animals.</p><p>Symmetrically, the projection of the attributes permits exploring how attribute similarities affect observation importances. This is accomplished via PrI by dragging attribute nodes and clicking the "Update Layout" button above the attribute panel. This triggers a very similar algorithm that effectively inverts the WMDS process in Equation 2 using only the attribute nodes the analyst interacted with,Â * and following the same 0 to 1 and sum to 1 constraints for W O :</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">W O = arg min W O 1 ,...,W On ∑ i∈Â * ∑ j∈Â * lDist(Â * i ,Â * j ) − hDist A (W O , A i , A j ) 2<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Using the new observation weights, the observation node sizes and opacities are updated to reflect these new levels of importance, and Equation 2 is re-executed to reproject all attributes. To demonstrate, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3-D</ref> shows that dragging the nodes for Grazer and Size far away from Water results in an increase in the importance for Horse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Goal 3: Relate Importances to Each Other</head><p>As SIRIUS has been described thus far, it is somewhat similar to Andromeda <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. The main difference is that instead of listing the attributes, an attribute projection is provided alongside the an observation projection. However, we now introduce two equations to interconnect observation importances and attribute importances:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">W O i = O i •W A and W A i = A i •W O .</formula><p>These equations can be more generally expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">W O = O •W A (5) W A = A •W O<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Both of these equations are used in initializing the projections as well as both PaI and PrI, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4</ref>, thereby interconnecting the projections of the observations and attributes together. This interconnectedness between observation importances and attribute importances has crucial implications in revealing new relationships and affording additional insights by providing methods to alter node size, opacity, and position for both observations and attributes after any interaction. Thus,  analysts are afforded insights such as correlations between observations or between attributes at a glance during any point of analysis.</p><p>Our use of these equations is loosely based on simple approaches to relevance computations in information retrieval and recommender systems, such as the HITS (Hubs and Authorities on the Internet) Algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, which underlies Google's PageRank query technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. However, a major difference is that HITS iterates over these two equations until convergence, whereas our implementation of SIRIUS only iterates once to enable explorations of alternative projections via PaI and PrI. However, it might be interesting to iterate until convergence during initialization.</p><p>Interconnecting the observation importances and the attribute importances is first seen when initializing each of the projections. For the projection of the observations, an observation weight vector is first initialized so that each observation has a weight of 1/n. This reflects an equal level of importance for each observation while maintaining the sum-to-1 and 0-to-1 constraints for the weight vector. Then, Equation 6 is used to determine the attribute importances. However, this equation is not constrained as the attribute weights are. Therefore, to use these attribute importance values for the attribute weights in Equation 1, they are normalized to sum to 1. Similarly, the projection of the attributes is initialized by first generating a set of attribute weights in which each weight is 1/p. Then, Equation 5 is used and normalized to sum to 1 to generate the observation weights for Equation 2.</p><p>After projecting the data using Equation 1 and Equation 2, as depicted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>, the node sizes and opacities can be interpreted as visualizations of (left) which observations are most important or best describe the differences between the attributes and (right) which attributes are most important or best describe the differences between the observations. For this initial projection, the manner in which the importances of the observations and attributes are determined result in emphasizing items that are most "popular" (i.e., have the highest sum across the dataset, as explained in Sect. 5.1.1). Additionally, these projections show similarities (i.e., correlations) between attributes or similarities between observations. These equations for importances are also used during each interaction. For example, when the analyst performs PaI on an attribute, a new set of observation importances is calculated using Equation 5. These importance values are used to update observation node size and opacity. Then, the observation importances are used to calculate a new set of attribute importances using Equation 6. This results in an update to attribute node size and opacity. Additionally, both observations and attributes are reprojected via Equation 1 and Equation 2 (respectively) after normalizing both new sets of importances to sum to 1. Thus, PaI results in node size, opacity, and position being updated in both projections. This effect is demonstrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3-A and Fig. 3-B</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, PrI in the observation panel produces a new set of attribute weights. These weights are used in Equation 1 to reproject the observations and in Equation 5 to determine new sizes and opacities for the observation nodes. Then, the new observation importances are used in Equation 6 to update the attribute node size and opacity. To update the attribute node positions, the new observation importances are normalized to sum to 1 and used in Equation 2. Thus, PrI also results in node size, opacity, and position being updated in both projections. This effect is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3-C and Fig. 3-D</ref>.</p><p>In the above use of dot products to relate observation importances to attribute importances and vice versa, there is an implied assumption that higher data values represent more importance. For example, we assume that a higher importance for the Water attribute indicates that animals that have a high value for the Water attribute are more important than animals with a low value. While this assumption is appropriate for some applications, such as in text analytics where values represent word occurrences, it may be less appropriate in other applications, such as wanting to emphasize both extrema. However, the technique for relating observation and attribute importances as described in Sect. 3 is purposefully generic to support a variety of mathematical definitions for relating importances, including one which might generate higher importance values for animals with extreme low Water values as well as those with extreme high Water values.</p><p>When interpreting the dual projections, it is important to understand that, while the node sizes and opacities in one projection describe the spatial layout of the other projection, the projections themselves do not map onto each other. That is, since the projections represent separate high-dimensional spaces, the spatial positions of nodes in one projection do not specifically relate to the node positions in the other. Attempting to align all spatial positions would create a projection similar to the Data Context Map <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, which necessarily distorts the similarities between the observations, attributes, or both, as discussed in Sect. 2.3. Although one of the projections can be rotated and reflected to better match the layout in the other projection (e.g., rotate the attribute panel so that the Water and Grazer attributes are roughly in the same positions as the animals that are higher in those attributes), the potential tradeoff is that this may lead analysts to conclude that the two projections can be mapped onto each other. An inaccurate conclusion such as this can lead to significant misinterpretations of how the projections relate to each other. For these reasons, we do not attempt any such alignment between the two projections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">EXAMPLES OF DATA ANALYSIS WITH SIRIUS</head><p>To demonstrate how Equations 1-6 coalesce to enable exploratory data analysis with diverse high-dimensional datasets, we provide examples of animal data, intelligence analysis data, and breast cancer data in our implementation of SIRIUS. These examples show that SIRIUS can be used to explore quantitative data, textual data, and large datasets, respectively. A demonstration video for each of these examples is available at https://youtu.be/TzBjImkrbDU.</p><p>Since Equations 1-6 rely on strictly numerical data, some of the example datasets had to be altered to change categorical attributes to numerical representations. Additionally, any rows that contained missing data were removed. Such issues could be better addressed through the use of alternative distance functions, such as Gower distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>As we move away from more intuitive datasets like the one by Lampert et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, it is important to note that raw data for a selected observation or attribute is displayed alongside the "Importance" slider. For numerical datasets, this raw data is expressed as a simple list of key-value pairs. For text datasets, selecting a document instead displays the associated raw text. Thus, analysts can readily explore the entire dataset without having to reference spreadsheets or outside tools to interpret the projections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">An Animal Dataset</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">The Full Dataset</head><p>Given the initial projection of the entire animal dataset by Lampert et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> depicted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, we can already begin gaining insights about the dataset. For example, while there are no strongly distinguished groups or clusters of animals, more water-dwelling animals appear in the upper right whereas more land-dwelling animals appear in the lower left. Despite the hypothesis that the differences between animals are best described by their Water attribute, the size and opacity of the attribute nodes indicate that Quadrupedal is the correct answer. Since this is the initial projection of the attributes, this also means more animals have a high value for Quadrupedal than for any other attribute. Therefore, many animals in the dataset are Quadrupedal and that this attribute is the most "popular" attribute in the dataset. In addition to these insights, the projection of the attributes shows that there are strong correlations between certain attributes, such as Quadrupedal and Furry, since they are projected closely together. Thus, an animal that has a high value for Quadrupedal is likely to also have a high value for Furry. Similarly, Grazer and Hooves are somewhat correlated, but since they <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. Given the initial projection shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2, (Top)</ref> the analyst can move animals to express their desired similarities or differences to begin investigating their three questions about this animal dataset.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Analysis on a Subset of the Dataset</head><p>Using the same subset of the animal dataset as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2 and Fig. 3</ref> for clarity, consider an analyst who wants to gain insights based on the three related questions mentioned in Section 1 using this dataset:</p><p>1. What attributes separate the Tiger and Wolf from the Blue Whale and Dolphin as well as from the Cow and Sheep? 2. What other animals are similar to those three groups? 3. What other attributes are correlated with the attributes that separate these three groups?</p><p>To answer these questions, after the data is initially projected (as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>), the analyst would begin by using PrI to move the nodes for the animals of interest into three groups, as depicted in the top row of <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. Clicking "Update Layout" results in the final projection shown in the bottom row of <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>.</p><p>Following this reprojection, the analyst can answer Question 1 by observing that the attributes Water, Hunter, and Grazer are large and opaque, thus leading to the insight that they describe the differences between the three groups of animals. Additionally, this projection gives the analyst the insight that Horse, Deer, Elephant, and Squirrel are similar to the Cow and Sheep; the Siamese Cat and German Shepherd are most like the Tiger and Wolf ; and the Otter is similar to the Dolphin and Blue Whale. Thus, Question 2 is also answered from this projection.</p><p>However, Question 1 and Question 2 can be answered by existing techniques such as Andromeda <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. What makes SIRIUS unique is that Question 3 can also be determined at a glance via the relative node positions in the attribute panel; more similar (or correlated) items will appear closer together in the projections. Thus, analysts can easily gain the insight that Furry, Active, Speed, Smart, Strength, and Size are all more correlated with Hunter than with Grazer or Water. Similarly, Stripes, Walks, Forager, and Spots are most correlated with Grazer. The Water attribute, in comparison to Hunter and Grazer, is not correlated with any other attributes.</p><p>Connecting these answers for Question 3 back to the animals, this means that the animals that have a high value in Hunter are more likely to have higher values for Furry, Active, Speed, Smart, Strength, and Size than animals that have a high value in Grazer or Water. Inspection of the animals in the observation panel (or domain knowledge) provides the insight that animals that are high in Hunter are animals like Tiger and Wolf. Similarly, animals that have a high value in Grazer (like the Cow and Sheep) are more likely to have higher values for Stripes, Walks, Forager, and Spots than animals that have a high value in Hunter or Water. Animals that have a high value in Water (like the Dolphin and Blue Whale) are not as likely as animals that have a high value in Hunter or Grazer to have higher values in any of the other attributes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">A Text-Based Dataset</head><p>As mentioned in Sect. 4.3, our notion of importance, defined by Equations 5-6, results in a high importance for observations that have high values for important attributes and vice versa. This definition of importance is well-suited for text-based datasets in which a higher value for an attribute (e.g., an extracted entity) denotes that the associated extracted entity appears more often in that document (observation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">TF-IDF Data vs Topic Modeled Data</head><p>To demonstrate how SIRIUS can be used to explore textual data, we extracted entities from a synthetic intelligence analysis dataset and created a TF-IDF matrix in data preprocessing steps. Using SIRIUS to visualize this data (depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 6-A)</ref>, we can immediately see that Charlottesville is greatly emphasized over other attributes. Given this is the initial projection, the emphasis on Charlottesville indicates that this entity has the highest sum of TF-IDF values across the entire dataset, hinting that there may be something nefarious occurring there. Since Charlottesville is the entity that has the largest influence on the documents in the observation panel, documents that mention Charlottesville (the 5 documents towards the top of the observation panel) are separated from the ones that don't (in the middle of the observation panel). Inspecting these Charlottesville documents provides insight on a terrorist plot in Charlottesville involving several individuals.</p><p>However, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 6</ref>-A has many of the observations and attributes overlapping with each other, making them harder to distinguish from each other. Although the attribute node labels have been removed to improve clarity in the projection, these labels are still accessible by hovering over a node. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> However, this issue can be also alleviated using topic modeling to essentially group attributes together (and thus better separate the documents) during an additional preprocessing step. <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>. From the initial projection of the topic modeled data shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 6</ref>-B, nefarious activity can be uncovered by (top) using PrI on the attributes to separate topics of interest from generic or uninteresting topics. Clicking "Update Layout" produces (bottom) a visualization which reveals other topics that are very closely correlated with topics of interest. Additionally, the combination of emphasized attributes results in fbi11 in the observation panel being highly emphasized. This document reveals crucial information to one of the three main terrorist plots in this dataset.</p><p>Visualizing the topics in place of the extracted entities results in the much clearer initial projections shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 6</ref>-B. The tradeoff in doing so is that the previous initial insight that Charlottesville may be the center of some nefarious activity is lost.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">Example Analysis</head><p>To show analysis on text data with SIRIUS, we use the topic modeled data to improve clarity. A reasonable starting point with a dataset like this is to pick out attributes (i.e., topics) that seem more indicative of nefarious activity than others. Examining the topics shown in the attribute panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 6</ref>-B uncovers a number of such topics, including one that focuses on passport information (dates/passport/address), another on police activity (polic/truck/two), and a third on explosions (report/driver/explos). In contrast, topics like &lt;number&gt;/cia/date seem perhaps generic or less useful to the initial investigation. Performing PrI by dragging the three attributes of interest into one corner to and &lt;number&gt;/cia/date into the opposite corner to expresses their desired similarities/dissimilarities (depicted in the top row of <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>) and clicking "Update Layout" above the attribute panel results in the visualization depicted in the bottom row of <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>. This visualization gives the insight that the topics &lt;number&gt;/report/phone and april/ave/report are very closely correlated with the three topics of interest that were moved. These new topics, along with fbi/list/&lt;number&gt; (which is now the most emphasized topic), are all worthy of further investigation.</p><p>However, most notably, this interaction resulted in the document fbi11 being highly emphasized in the observation panel, giving insight on its strong association with the emphasized topics in the attribute panel. Reading the contents of this document reveals information that happens to be central to one of the three main terrorist plots contained within the dataset, as further analysis can confirm.</p></div>

However, this attribute, along with Single Cell Epithelial Size and Bland Chromatin are the attributes that are most closely correlated with the Class attribute and therefore may be useful in diagnosing breast cancer in patients.</p><p>an analyst can immediately gain the insights that Bland Chromatin and Single Cell Epithelial Size do help distinguish between observations, but Clump Thickness describes the separation between the different observations better than the others. Additionally, since Clump Thickness is the closest attribute node to Class, this means that Clump Thickness is the attribute that has the strongest correlation with Class. This correlation explains why observations seemed to be well-separated by class. Theses insights also mean that doctors may be able to use clump thickness, bland chromatin, and single cell epithelial size to help distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous tumors. While these insights may be obvious to medical practitioners, the fact that SIRIUS immediately uncovers them demonstrates its ability to easily reveal critical information in high-dimensional datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DISCUSSION, LIMITATIONS, AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In our supplementary material, we thoroughly evaluate the capabilities of SIRIUS against 10 existing visual analytics projection techniques, emphasizing the different insights afforded. Here, we highlight that SIRIUS is enables exploratory data analysis on observations and attributes simultaneously and efficiently, as evidenced in Sect. 5. This includes insights such as attribute correlations while exploring observation similarities, which can be gained through few, simple interactions.</p><p>Using Andromeda <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> as a contrasting example, PaI and PrI are enabled on a single observation projection (accomplishing half of Goals 1 and 2). A separate Andromeda instance would need to be run simultaneously to display the attributes to enable the same interactions on an attribute projection (for the other half of Goal 1 and Goal 2). While this would provide the two projections and the same interactions within each, they would remain disconnected (falling short of Goal 3). Thus, the analyst would be forced to estimate or even guess how to manipulate one projection to reflect changes in the other. This process would be time-consuming and error-prone, easily resulting in incorrect conclusions. Therefore, we assert that SIRIUS provides a more powerful platform for performing data analytics tasks that incorporate both the observations and the attributes of a dataset, such as the example tasks in Sect. 5, than existing techniques.</p><p>However, using SIRIUS comes with the potential tradeoff of how one projection cannot be transposed on top of another (as exemplified by the bottom row in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>), which may be confusing for some analysts. Despite this, we highlight that every projection provided in SIRIUS is a valid projection that can provide rich, meaningful insights, as demonstrated in Sect. 5.</p><p>One potential limitation of our implementation of SIRIUS is in the usability and understandability of PrI caused by the fact that only a subset of nodes are used to calculate a new set of weights, which are then applied to all nodes. While Self et al. explore this limitation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, the user study described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> highlights the benefits that PrI can bring to the analysis process.</p><p>Another limitation of our implementation of SIRIUS is a "jumping" effect, which is most evident when performing PaI on each panel in sequence. This effect stems from our use of Equation 5 and Equation 6.</p><p>For example, assume that PaI was just performed in the attribute panel. The weights for the changed attributes, W A , are first fed into Equation 5. The observation weights, W O , resulting from that equation is then fed into Equation 6 to determine a final set of attribute weights, W A . Repetitions of this interaction follow the same flow; for small, subsequent changes to W A , this series of steps results in similarly small changes to W O . However, when an observation's importance value is then manipulated, the first step instead becomes that the new W O is fed into Equation 6 to determine a new W A . Since the W A here is very different than the previous W A , the projection of the attributes changes greatly. Therefore, although an analyst may expect both projections to change minimally, a large change is reflected in the attribute projection.</p><p>One cause of this "jumping" effect is that the cycle of Equation 5 and Equation 6 have a single convergence point, as suggested by the HITS algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. However, since we want to explore alternative projections, we necessarily consider other pairs of weight vectors for which the cycle is not converged and therefore "jump" when the analyst switches their interaction back and forth between the projections.</p><p>A related cause of the "jumping" effect is the memorylessness of the interaction. When a new interaction is performed, our implementation of SIRIUS only uses the most recent interaction to update the visualization. One possible way to address this issue is to alter Equations 5-6 to incorporate previous interactions or projections. For instance, Leman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> suggest a weighted average of the weight vectors produced by the most recent interaction with vectors from previous interactions.</p><p>Lastly, a limitation to our implementation of SIRIUS is the size of data that is supported due to the the n 2 and n 2 p 2 computational complexities for projection and interaction optimizations (respectively). However, recent performance improvements in the computation of WMDS projections <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> as well as PrI interactions (which others in the BaVA @ VT group are researching) can greatly increase the size of datasets that can be supported with interactive response times. However, this issue may also be alleviated for some datasets by implementing foraging features (e.g., searching and filtering for text data) in which only the most important observations and attributes are projected, such as StarSPIRE <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>We intend to address these issues and limitations by continuing to develop our implementation of SIRIUS. This will also enable us to improve other aspects as well, such as the placement and size of the node labels in the projections or adding trails to highlight the impact the interaction had on the nodes' locations . With a more refined implementation in hand, we will be able to provide thorough evaluations on the time complexities of our refined algorithms as well as run user studies to evaluate interpretability and usability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we identified an opportunity for dual, symmetric, interactive projections of high-dimensional data to support the interconnectedness between observations and attributes in exploratory data analysis tasks. Given this need, we defined a generalized technique called SIR-IUS, consisting of three principles: (1) dual projections of observations and attributes, (2) symmetric interactions on importances to explore projections, (3) symetrically relating importances of observations to importances of attributes. To concretize these principles, we described a specific implementation based on WMDS, weighted Euclidean distance, parametric and projection interactions, and dot-product importance calculations. A set of examples then demonstrated how SIRIUS provides insights across a range of diverse datasets, and we compared SIRIUS against a suite of existing techniques. SIRIUS offers new insight into both observations and attributes of high-dimensional data and their interrelationships, while maintaining a consistent symmetric mental model of each.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>The results of two examples of PaI and two examples of PrI described in Sect. 4 withFig. 2as the initial projection of the data and continuing to map "importance" to node size and opacity: A PaI performed on the Water attribute; B PaI performed on the Cow observation; C PrI performed by dragging the Dolphin and Blue Whale observations into one corner and the Elephant observation into the opposite corner; and D PrI performed by dragging the Grazer and Size attributes into one corner and the Water attribute into the opposite corner.</figDesc></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">In this paper, we define observations to be the items in a dataset and the attributes as properties or dimensions of those items.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">Briefly, PaI refers to direct alteration of a model parameter via some control mechanism, such as a slider or textbox. An analyst may update that parameter with a precise value. In contrast, PrI learns a set of model parameters based on an interpretation of analyst alteration of the projection itself.</note>
