<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Publication records contain rich information and play an important role in assessing the expertise and experience of researchers, for instance, when recruiting faculty members, forming a program committee, or finding potential collaborators. Existing digital library systems show relevant author-centric information, but only add little abstraction to raw publication records. For instance, they abstract publication meta data to co-author relationships but only provide them as a list rather than an explorable co-author visualization. Users have to go through different views and apply various filters to gather the required information. As an alternative, visualizations that show publication and author data have been suggested. Although existing visualizations provide high-level abstractions about author profiles, their focus is often narrower, or they grow difficult to read and complex when adding more information.</p><p>In contrast, we suggest combining visualizations with natural language text and leverage the advantages of both representations. Natural language is easy to understand and self-explaining, it provides great flexibility for integrating various context, and can express implicit data explicitly. When showing larger sets of items and numbers, however, visualization can provide an overview and rich insights. For an interplay, both representations need to be closely integrated. We achieve this by interactively linking textual and visual data descriptions as well as augmenting the text with sparklines <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>, small visualizations that are integrated in line with the text.</p><p>We describe a novel way of presenting publication records and related analysis results for scientific authors. Our system VIS Author Profiles (VAP), a Web-based visual analytics tool, generates author profiles in the form of interactive reports <ref type="figure">(Figure 1)</ref>. The text describes general statistics, research topics, and collaboration networks. In addition, interactive visualizations allow for understanding trends and extended collaboration relationships. Our main contributions are:</p><p>• the identification of author-centric information needs for relevant academic usage scenarios that are not sufficiently supported by existing systems (Section 2),</p><p>• the extensions of a template-based text generation approach for the integrated production of interactive, visualization-enriched documents (Section 4),</p><p>• a system for the generation of profiles for authors of the visualization community, including analysis and summary of publication records, research topics, and collaborations (Section 5), and</p><p>• a realistic demonstration of the approach in two scenarios (Section 6) as well as a discussion of applicability and extendibility of the approach (Section 7).</p><p>The novelty of the approach lies in the joint and integrated generation of natural language text and visualization. Our solution is a visual analytics system in the form of interactive visual reports that builds on algorithmic data analysis and preprocessing. The focus, however, is the comprehensible dissemination of results and storytelling. Although our primary goal is to provide explanations, the proposed system also supports exploratory analysis to some extent as a secondary objective.</p><p>The interactive system is available at https://vis-tools.paluno. uni-due.de/vap/ and the supplemental material of the paper contains an interactive appendix with additional information on results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">ANALYZING PUBLICATION RECORDS</head><p>We first discuss the application of analyzing publications records: for which author types and scenarios such analysis is targeted, how we frame the scope, and what information an analyst requires.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Author Personas</head><p>Our work is focused on authors of scientific papers, a group ranging from PhD students who have just published their first paper to senior researchers who have authored hundreds of publications. We aim at creating meaningful reports for all these researchers. In detail, we discern the following categories of authors-we call these categories personas in the sense that they represent a certain role or stereotype:</p><p>• Student: A student (Bachelor, Master, or PhD level) who contributes to research projects within a study program or dependent employment under the supervision of experienced researchers.</p><p>• Researcher: A postdoctoral researcher, assistant professor, research scientist, or lecturer who is conducting first independent research and might start supervising students.</p><p>• Senior Researcher: An associate or full professor, senior research scientist, or senior lecturer who can build on years of experience in research and supervising.</p><p>• Occasional Contributor: An outsider to the studied scientific community who occasionally contributes to academic work within the community.</p><p>We do not claim that every author can be unambiguously assigned to a certain persona. However, this list helps us structure the set of authors and make sure that our approach finally produces meaningful descriptions for authors of various levels of experience. Although we do not automatically identify the persona of a researcher, the association of researchers to personas is indirectly linked to their experience such as the number of published articles, active years in research, and whether they have supervised other researchers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Scenarios</head><p>Publication lists of researchers reflect their accumulated formal contributions to science. They not only provide information on research activity, but also on the topics the authors have worked on and their collaboration network. We focus on two scenarios that build on publication records and require an author-centric view. Use cases like literature search or the analysis of a research field are out of scope for this paper. S1 -Recruiting: The overarching question of every recruiting process is how well the candidate is qualified for the job. In academia, this is closely linked to the level of academic experience and achievements. In addition to a CV, the publication record of the candidate is a main source of information. Similar scenarios that can be considered a variant are the admission to a funding program as well as assessing researchers as part of a grant or tenure evaluation.</p><p>S2 -Assessing Expertise: In contrast to recruiting, where specific people apply, assessing the expertise of researchers for a task or role is open for additional suggestions-in addition to understanding the data of a single researcher, users also want to explore related researchers. Typical examples are to find a reviewer for a specific paper, to select candidates for a program committee, or to look for potential collaborators or supervisors. In all cases, expertise with respect to certain research topics as well as experience regarding academic work are key criteria to invite or contact a researcher.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Scope and Data</head><p>All sciences and research fields share that they publish articles, papers, and books. The specific publication culture, however, differs largely between fields, from monograph-oriented areas to purely peer-reviewedbased systems. We focus in our work on publications from computer science, which is our own research area and where we have a good understanding of the publication culture. DBLP makes available the required publication meta data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> For investigating research topics, we want to make use of the keywords that the authors assigned to the papers. This information is not available in DBLP or any general data collection for all computer science. Hence, we decided to focus on the visualization area, where the Visualization Publication Data Collection provides such information. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> We restrict the generated author profiles to authors listed in this data set, but also integrate DBLP data to add publications of these authors that appeared in non-visualization venues. This narrower focus also allows us to consider specifics of the visualization community, for instance, its subdivision into the fields of scientific visualization, information visualization, and visual analytics.</p><p>The combined data includes 5,086 authors and 128,961 publications till August 29, 2017. For the retrieval of research topics, we further enrich the data by categorizing the most frequent publication venues (i.e., journals, conferences, workshops, etc.) into research communities of computer science. A classification of 688 venues with 56 keywords provided a community assignment for 61,469 publications. We enrich these high-level keywords with further keywords extracted from paper titles based on a manually created mapping of 26 typical terms (e.g., visualizing → visualization). To identify subtopics within the visualization community, we leverage the author-assigned keywords. Since they are inconsistent, we use the mapping that the KeyVis project provides to map them to a standardized set of keywords. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref> We select a subset of such aggregated keywords that-in our opinion-best reflects certain subareas of the visualization community and map these to simpler terms preserving their original meaning as far as possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Information Needs</head><p>For the above scenarios, we derive information needs that users might have with respect to the described publication data. A list of publications may give rich insights about the research topics a researcher is working on as well as an overview on the researcher's collaborators. Further, publication statistics and temporal evolution of publication activity hint at experience levels and academic achievements. While citation and biographic information would provide more details, we restrict ourselves to publication data because of its wide, reliable, and standardized availability. Therefore, we do not list any information needs that would require such additional data sources.</p><p>First, general statistics provide an idea how actively a researcher is publishing, which is a central criterion for recruiting (S1). In computer science, both certain journals and conference proceedings can be considered premier publication venues. On average, however, the journal articles have an estimated higher contribution because of their greater length and due to the fact that proceedings might also comprise short papers and workshop contributions. Hence, discriminating journal articles from proceedings papers hints at potential contributions of the publications. The temporal distribution of publications indicates academic age and level of experience, which is not only relevant for recruiting (S1) but also for finding an expert with sufficient experience (S2). A special publication is the PhD thesis, where the author independently worked on a topic and set a first academic milestone. First-author publications can be considered particularly relevant when hiring early-career researchers (S1), because these might best express the research interests and abilities of the author (assuming that, like commonly applied in practical computer science, the author sequence reflects contributions but does not follow alphabetic order). For selecting experts (S2), it is important to understand their areas of experience on different levels of abstraction-we discern between research communities (e.g., visualization), subfields (e.g., scientific visualization), and focus areas (e.g., flow visualization). Also, the temporal evolution is relevant for distinguishing a researcher's current and previous research direction. Research topics can also lead to other researchers with similar expertise-imagine you invited the researcher to do a review, but the researcher has declined, and you need to find somebody with a similar focus. Frequent co-authors, who naturally share similar research interests, are excluded here but will be discussed as part of the next group of information needs.  Finally, co-author relationships help to see how a researcher is connected in a community. This information is important when searching for references of a candidate (S1), judging on influence, academic inheritance and experience in supervising (S1), or searching for similar experts (S2). A special relationship that can be estimated from author sequence in publications is the supervisor (often, one of the last authors) and supervisee (often, first author). Former supervisees already supervising other researchers indicate certain influence of the supervisors. Moreover, the co-authors may form noteworthy subgroups; for instance, an author might frequently publish on a certain topic with a specific subset of co-authors.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IN 1 -General</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">EXISTING SYSTEMS AND RELATED WORK</head><p>Various digital library systems already allow for interactive exploration of publication data of scientific authors; we evaluate them against the information needs discussed above and show that they do not yet satisfy the needs sufficiently. Complementary to this, visualizations provide representations of the same data. This section also discusses this previous work from the application domain and introduces techniques to integrate text and visualization like intended in our approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Digital Library Systems</head><p>We categorize views of existing digital library systems for exploring scientific literature into publication-centric and author-centric views. We focus our discussion on the latter because these are more closely related to the scope of our approach and exclude systems that do not have a dedicated author profile page (e.g., IEEE Xplore). Google Scholar is probably the most widely used publication-centric system for online literature search. Besides the main search interface, it has a profile page for each (registered) author containing information on affiliation, research topics, list of publications, co-authors, and citations. Microsoft Academic is a competing system and has similar layout for author profiles. The author profiles of ACM Digital Library, DBLP, ResearchGate, and Semantic Scholar use faceted browsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref> to subselect the publications along certain facets such as the publication type, topic, co-author, or publication venue. Google Scholar, Scopus, and Semantic Scholar show citation or publication frequency on a timeline. AMiner provides other visualizations, including a stream graph of research topics, a Kiviat diagram of publication metrics, and an ego-centric (simplified) co-author network. Semantic Scholar features a visualization of academic impact. But none of them uses generated natural language text as part of the author profile.</p><p>We evaluate if the information needs (Section 2.4) are already fulfilled by existing systems. The evaluation considers the availability of features, but not their usability or data quality. This provides an objective and reproducible comparison, whereas rating quality attributes would necessarily be subjective. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref> summarizes the outcomes of the evaluation; an extended interactive version of the table is part of the interactive appendix and provides explanations for every rating.</p><p>Whereas all systems show a list of publications in temporal order, not all discern publication types ( IN 1.1) or show publications distributions aggregated on a timeline ( IN 1.2). No system highlights first author publications, but PhD theses (though rarely contained in the data sets) can at least be retrieved in those systems that allow for filtering by publication type ( IN 1.3). Research communities ( IN 2.1) can be identified in most cases, indirectly derived from aggregated venue information (e.g., DBLP) and author-selected keywords (e.g., Google Scholar), or directly as automatically mined subject areas (e.g., Scopus). Similarly, more detailed information on subfields is indirectly or directly available in most systems ( IN 2.2). In contrast, the analysis of the evolution of research topics is only supported in AMiner and Semantic Scholar by providing a timeline ( IN 2.3). AMiner is the only system that indicates similar researchers ( IN 2.4). Finally, the systems mostly list frequent collaborators, but-except for Semantic Scholar-without temporal information ( IN 3.1). Only AMiner explicitly highlights supervisors and supervisees of an author ( IN 3.2 </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ACM Digital Library • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • AMiner • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • DBLP • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • Google Scholar • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • ResearchGate • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • Scopus • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • Semantic Scholar • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • •</formula><p>and IN 3.3). None of the systems considerably supports the identification of collaboration groups ( IN 3.4) except for DBLP.</p><p>In conclusion, there are systems like DBLP and Google Scholar that are easy to use, but only fulfill a smaller fraction of the information needs. In contrast, other systems like AMiner and Semantic Scholar already meet a good share of the information needs and might be extensible towards the remaining ones. However, these systems feel already overloaded with views, tables, and visualizations-adding more information would further clutter the display. Our suggestion is the usage of natural text to describe a large variety of information in an easy-to-understand and compact way. We aim at fully supporting all information needs listed above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Author Visualizations</head><p>In our approach, we focus on individual authors and want to summarize their publication activity and co-author collaboration networks. From a perspective of social network analysis, we can consider this to be an egocentric perspective. Some ego-centric (dynamic) graph visualizations have studied evolving co-author relationships. Huang and Huang <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> show years as rings subdivided by color-coded co-authors. Reitz <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> uses links in an ego-centric node-link diagram to encode temporal distributions of the joint work. In contrast, Shi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> extend the ego node to a timeline and connect co-authors to points in time where joint work appeared. Similarly, EgoNetCloud [23] uses a single timeline to which the co-authors can be connected or arranged in independent nodelink components along the timeline. egoSlider <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> also shows authorspecific timelines, where co-authors cluster vertically at points in time and are linked through time steps. MENA <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> represents the ego-centric network as a dynamic graph in small multiples. Fung et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref> suggest a botanically inspired tree visualization to summarize in each branch the collaborations of a time span with co-authors encoded as leaves. In our approach, we include a visualization related to the discussed ego-centric visualizations to show the collaboration network. But it is only a small part of the interactive document-we also integrate other versatile information to the profile description, for instance, covering research topics and a summary of general author information.</p><p>In addition to ego-centric author visualizations, various other visualizations also show author information, for instance, in the form of a co-author graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>. These systems often integrate information on research topics, in the coloring of the nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> or as topic-collaboration nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. CiteWiz <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> combines co-author networks with keyword co-occurrence networks and citation impact visualizations. PivotSlice <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> use faceted exploration to investigate an author's publications based on keywords, citation, and venue information. PivotPaths <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref> links author nodes to paper nodes to keyword nodes and supports an interactive exploration. SurVis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref> associates word clouds of keywords and authors in a faceted browsing approach for literature collections. For further approaches on visualization of scientific literature datasets, we refer to the recent survey of Federico et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. In general, we are not aware of any approach that augments such visualizations with generated textual descriptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Integration of Generated Text and Visualization</head><p>Natural language generation (NLG) is the field that investigates how to produce natural language text from data and abstracted information <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>. We use a simple template-based generation approach, which-unlike more advanced approaches-does not build a full grammar model of the sentences. We chose this approach because it already provides sufficient flexibility and power for the intended purpose. Moreover, it is easier to design and control.</p><p>While there exist various generation approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, only few have investigated the joint generation of text and visualizations as part of multimodal documents (i.e., documents that integrate text and graphics). Previous work scatters among many domains, for instance, user and maintenance instructions for physical devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, weather forecasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, or learning analytics in an education scenario <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. Furthermore, the generation of textual content with respect to existing diagrams is related <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25]</ref>, but here the visualization is already given and not generated in coordination with the text. There are only few approaches that take into account the close integration and interactive linking between the textual and visual content. Method Execution Reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> describes the execution behavior of the method of a program; it integrates simple graphics into the text and makes them explorable to some extent. PersaLog <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> advocates the personalization of news consisting of text and interactive visualization; the system focuses on how personalized content can be authored but does not particularly discuss the close integration of text and visualizations. In contrast to these systems, our approach studies a different area of application and goes at least one step ahead regarding the close and interactive integration of textual and visual content as part of an interactive document.</p><p>Embedding sparklines, "data-intense, design-simple, word-sized graphic[s]" <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> also called word-sized <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> or word-scale graphics <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, into the text is a means for achieving a close integration of text and visualizations. We use interactive sparklines <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref> that can be explored on demand and are linked to text and regular visualizations. Others have already demonstrated that sparklines can be leveraged for literature data analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref>. Note that the term sparkline is not only used for small line charts, but-in accordance to the original definition of Tufte <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>-refers to any word-sized graphic; the sparklines used in this paper are all small bar charts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">GENERATING INTERACTIVE VISUAL REPORTS</head><p>Before we introduce the actual content of the interactive author profiles, we provide some technical background on the generation process. We use template-based natural language generation to automatically produce text from data that we then connect with visualizations and augment with interactions. The selection of relevant items is a frequent problem that we are facing in the text generation process, for which we suggest a generic solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Generation Pipeline</head><p>The first step in our generation pipeline is the pre-processing of DBLP publication records. We integrate this data with the Visualization Publication Data Collection and enrich it with keywords as discussed in Section 2.3. All pre-processing is done in Java. The front end is written in HTML and JavaScript. For producing the visualizations, we use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and D3js. The text generation templates are implemented as part of the front-end code in JavaScript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Template-based Text Generation</head><p>Template-based systems work with well-formed, pre-written phrases with gaps in them and produce the output text when these gaps are filled with data. For instance, an announcement generation system at a train station can be considered as a very simple example of template To build the templates, we followed an informal iterative approach. In every iteration, we drafted a text fragment based on an author's publication record. We implemented a base version of it as a template and then kept on refining and fine-tuning the template by testing over many random authors belonging to various personas and special cases. We continued the iterations until the text covered all information needs discussed in Section 2.4. With this approach, we received quick results and continuously tested the generated text.</p><p>Step by step, we also integrated interactions and visualizations in a similar fashion.</p><p>We follow a similar approach for generating natural language text as applied in Method Execution Reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. Directed acyclic decision graphs <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref> gives an example) generate text from the parameterized templates. An author's profile consists of three fixed paragraphs (one for each group of information needs) and we define a decision graph per paragraph. The sequence of text fragments (usually, a text fragment represents a sentence or phrase) within a paragraph is fixed. In the decision graph, start and stop vertices mark the beginning and end of the text generation process, text vertices (rectangular nodes) add a new text fragment to the paragraph when traversed, and finally decision vertices (rounded rectangular nodes) determine the path based on conditional statements. The path is deterministic and any traversal from start to stop vertex results in a paragraph. Hence, the text fragments need to be designed to form well-formed sentences regarding all possible paths.</p><p>Our approach is flexible and produces grammatically correct sentences if all conditions are carefully checked. In the templates, we take into account the already generated text and connect to previous sentences with appropriate conjunctions. The use of numerals (e.g., one, two) in place of numbers (if a paragraph only contains small numbers less than 10) and rounding down larger numbers to nearest fifties make the text more natural to read. We use adjectives to characterize the objects we are describing (e.g., long-lasting collaboration) and consider different tenses for a correct referral to time spans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Integration of Text and Graphics</head><p>A novel aspect of our approach is the coherent integration and linking of jointly generated text and graphics. A first step of integration is the embedding of sparklines in the lines of the text, which already visually connects the visualized data to the related phrase. Moreover, the use of regular-sized visualizations, which are interactively linked to the text and sparklines, allows detailed exploration of data. Our visualizationtext interactions are adaptations from the previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>, which describes the linking of text, sparklines, and regular visualizations. For instance, clicking on linked text fragments highlights relevant parts of visualization and shows related data in a side panel. All sparklines are also linked to a larger visualization-on click, the information presented in the sparkline is shown as an overlay in the visualization. With respect to layout transitions for sparklines <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, this can be considered an offsetting solution (in contrast to in-place and growing transitions). We further use info icons to mark the availability of additional explanations and present this information on click.</p><p>We include interactive sparklines as part of the text templates; they can be considered as parameters (gaps) in the template. For instance, when the vertex named First author publications <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>) is visited, a sentence about researcher's first author publications including the corresponding sparkline, showing temporal distribution of these publications, is produced (e.g., third sentence in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Selection of Data Items</head><p>Throughout the analysis of publication records, we come across large lists of data items that need to be sliced to a reasonable length for presenting in the text. We assume that every item has an importance value attached that can be represented as a numeric value. For instance, in a list of co-authors (data items), the number of joint publications is considered as the importance value. Similarly, in a list of keywords, the frequency of each keyword might be the importance value. The selection problem may sound trivial-one could just select the top x items. However, if we as human authors of a text would select a number of important items, we do not restrict ourselves to a fixed number, but choose a good cut-off point dynamically. We try to avoid that the list grows too long, but we also do not cut off at a position where the distance to the next item is small. Hence, we need to select a to b items from a sorted list L = (l i ) n i=1 of n numeric items (n &gt; b, l i ≥ l i+1 ). We select cut-off index c ∈ [a, b] where the difference of list elements l c+1 − l c is maximal. However, there can be several maximal differences-in that case, we pick the smallest index, formally:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">c = min arg max k∈[a,b+1] l k+1 − l k<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Finally, the list is cut after element l c and hence only contains the top c elements. In the following, we refer to this procedure as Equation 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">VIS AUTHOR PROFILES</head><p>VIS Author Profiles (VAP) is a Web-based visual analytics tool that generates profiles for authors of the visualization community describing their publication record. It is designed to fulfill the information needs discussed in Section 2.4 ( IN 1 -General Information, IN 2 -Research Topics, and IN 3 -Collaboration Network). In order to create a coherent and easy-to-use interface, we applied the following set of design principles throughout the development process.</p><p>• Make it self-explaining: We want to leverage natural language text to explain the data and analysis results. When the explanations would make the main text become lengthy, we at least make additional information available on demand.</p><p>• Make algorithms and data transparent: We provide background on our algorithms and make underlying data relevant to a context available on demand to allow users validate the textual descriptions and build trust in our descriptions.</p><p>• Better say nothing than say something wrong: The explicit description in text holds us responsible for what we say; therefore, we leave out descriptions if uncertainty is too high. Uncertainty decreases with a higher quantity of information (e.g., better data availability) or a higher quality of information (e.g., more reliable heuristics). We calibrated the parameters when to omit a certain finding as part of our iterative fine-tuning process. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the user interface of VAP. The central panel is used to display the textual description of an author profile and is divided into three paragraphs describing (i) general information, (ii) research topics, and (iii) the co-author network. The co-author publication timeline visualization at the bottom provides insights into the joint work by presenting all co-authors and their yearly publications. The right sidebar is reserved for displaying details on demand such as additional explanations and publication records. The ego publication timeline at the top right provides temporal distribution of individual, joint, and topic-filtered publication records with respect to the selected profile author. Enlarged versions of the sparklines are also displayed in this bar chart. The text produced in boldface characters is interactive and allows for exploring the underlying publication records by presenting them in the sidebar. Author names in the publication list and anywhere on the page are links to their profiles. Please note that the authors, not available in the Visualization Publication Data Collection, are not explorable through our tool and are marked with asterisk (*). An info icon in the text indicates that users can explore additional information by clicking and loading this information in the sidebar.</p><p>To provide a quick overview of a researcher's experience, we use digital badges and display them next to the author's name in the header as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. It is a concept applied in computer games and often used for gamification (i.e., to make a non-game interface or tasks more enjoyable or increase the motivation of users through integrating game aspects). These badges are indicators of accomplishments and skills. We award gold, bronze, and silver badges based on various levels of experience in terms of number of published papers, length of active publication time, and supervision of other researchers.</p><p>For instance, the golden sup-supervisor badge (third from left) indicate that the supervisees of the author have also started supervising (i.e., is following an academic career) and silver article badge (fourth from left) highlights an accomplishment of publishing thirty research papers or more. Badges are intended to roughly match the author personas (cf. Section 2.1): students can realistically earn bronze badges, but as soon as authors have a first silver badge, they can be considered researchers, and senior researchers for a first golden badge. Only occasional contributors are harder to link to the badges, as they might be active for a long time, but do not publish many papers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">General Information</head><p>The first paragraph of the main text gives an overview of the publication statistics of the author and aims at fulfilling the general information needs <ref type="figure">( IN 1)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> shows the text for author Benjamin Bach as an example of a researcher. It is generated by traversing the decision graph shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> according to the following path: Start → #Publications? (I) → Last pub. year? (I) → Publication span (years)? → Active researcher (II) → Temporal pattern? → Temporal pub. trend → Publication types → #Publications? (II) → First author publications → PhD thesis? → PhD thesis → Stop.</p><p>In general, the first sentence starts by reporting the total number of publications <ref type="figure">( IN 1.1</ref>) and highlights the current status as active if the last publication appeared no earlier than five years ago (nodes Active researcher (I) and (II) in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>) or span of research if researcher is not active anymore (nodes Inactive researcher (I) and (II)). Active longtime contribution (≥ 20 years), like for author Ben Shneiderman (cf. <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>, is also indicated <ref type="figure">( IN 1.2;</ref> node Longtime researcher). The adjacent sparkline shows the temporal distribution of publications in more detail <ref type="figure">( IN 1.2 -publication span)</ref>.</p><p>We manually analyzed the publication behavior of a set of authors across all personas to extract the most commonly occurring temporal patterns, which were then implemented and detected automatically. For  each detected pattern ( IN 1.2 -temporal publication distribution), we add a clause (node Temporal pub. trend). As two of the most frequent and notable patterns, we currently highlight if authors published more than half the papers in any third of their publication history and exceptional peak years greater than twice of second maximum value in the time series of yearly publications. Author Bach has a clearly growing publication rate and hence most publications appeared in the last third.</p><p>Next, we discern the publications as journal articles and proceedings papers (node Publication types) with respective sparklines attached <ref type="figure">( IN 1.1 -publication types)</ref>.</p><p>Considering the importance of publications as first author for earlycareer researchers, the third sentence states the number and temporal distribution of such publications as text and in a sparkline respectively ( IN 1.3 -first author publications; node First author publications). For senior researchers, this number is not as important anymore and hence skipped (cf. <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, information about the author's PhD (dissertation title, institution, and year of publication) is described in the last sentence of this paragraph ( IN 1.3 -PhD thesis; node PhD thesis)-unfortunately, this data is only available for a fraction of the authors in DBLP. Profiles authors with one or only few publications have a largely reduced version of this paragraph in their profile.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Research Topics</head><p>The following second paragraph aims at satisfying the information needs corresponding to the research communities and evolution of topics <ref type="figure">( IN 2)</ref>. We analyze the publications enriched with venue specific keywords and author specified keywords as described in Section 2.3. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows an excerpt of the profile of senior researcher Daniel Weiskopf. Since we restrict ourselves to the visualization community, this paragraphs starts with the description of authors status within the visualization community ( IN 2.1 -research community). We discern between core member, member, and contributor depending on the number of research papers that are classified under the visualization keyword. We describe the author as active if the most recent publication appeared with in the last two years. Next, we discuss relevant subfields for the visualization community: information visualization, scientific visualization, and visual analytics, which appear in the order of frequency in that they are assigned to the author's publications ( IN 2.2subfields). The focus areas within visualization research are reported in the following sentence <ref type="figure">( IN 2.2 -focus areas)</ref>.</p><p>Then, other research areas are listed the author has contributed to, again in the order of keyword frequency ( IN 2.1 -connection to other communities). We discern current and past research topics (since the authors of the examples in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> and 4 are still actively contributing to all listed communities, this part is skipped here). In both cases, we limit the list to three to six keywords according to Equation 1. The communities are highlighted in blue, subfields in light blue, and research topics in light gray. Those keywords marked in bold font are linked with publications and are listed in the sidebar on click. Their temporal evolution is shown as an overlay on the ego publication timeline ( IN 2.3 -evolution of topics).</p><p>For the identification of authors having similar research interests ( IN 2.4), we compare the research interests of the profile author with all other authors within the visualization community. We compute their cosine similarity based on keyword frequency vectors. Since keyword coverage is not optimal in our data, we restrict the similarity computation to authors with at least 30 publications to avoid marking less similar authors as similar. Since frequent collaborators are likely to share most research interests, we also exclude co-authors that share more than two publications with the profile author from the comparison. We use again Equation 1 to cut short the list to the three to five most similar authors in the last sentence of this paragraph. A longer list of similar authors is available on demand (cf. Figure1, bottom right).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Co-Author Network</head><p>To analyze the collaboration network formed within the co-authors <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">( IN 3)</ref>, we explore pairwise collaborations as well as groups of researchers working together. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> shows the textual description of the co-author network of researcher Katherine E. Isaacs along with the co-author publication timeline.</p><p>This paragraph first describes the pairwise collaborations among the most frequent co-authors <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">( IN 3.1 -main collaborators)</ref>. The frequent three to eight co-authors are selected using Equation 1 from the list of all co-authors based on the amount of joint publications. The most frequent collaborations are described along with their current status (e.g., still ongoing, ended). The use of adjectives such as prolonged and long-lasting highlight if the span of collaboration is more than 15 years. If the collaboration has ended, we mark it with the total span of years along with the number of joint publications. Adjacent sparklines show the temporal distribution of joint work. Users can load the comparative view of joint publications as a proportion of the profile author's overall publications in the ego publication timeline as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Further exploration of the joint publications is possible by interacting with this chart-the publications of a selected year appear in the right sidebar sorted in alphabetical order of their titles.</p><p>In the scientific community, two roles of an author are of significant importance; i.e., supervisor and supervisee <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">( IN 3.2 and IN 3.3)</ref>. To identify these roles, we use a heuristic method with two assumptions: (i) the name of the supervisor appears at the last positions in an author sequence of a publication and (ii) the name of supervisee appears at the first position. All co-authors of the profile author who started publishing at least five years prior to the profile author are added to a list of potential supervisors. Then, the potential supervisors who appear more frequently before the profile author in their joint publications than after are discarded. Finally, a potential supervisor is identified as a supervisor if, in fifty percent of their joint publications, the potential supervisor appears at the last position. Analogously, supervisees are computed. We highlight the author roles while describing their collaborations with adjacent sparklines as introduced above. For senior researchers like author Ben Shneiderman (cf. <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>, the list of supervisees is quite long. We, therefore, list more supervisees in the following sentence after cutting down the list to a maximum of five further supervisees by applying Equation 1 and using their number of joint publications with the profile author as rating. Sparklines again provide details on the temporal distribution of joint work. To find if the supervisees of the profile author are already assuming the role of supervisors <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">( IN 3.3)</ref>, we look for the supervisees of the supervisees and describe this in the fifth sentence. Since our approach could not detect a clear supervisor or supervisees for Katherine E. Isaacs, her profile text does not comment on this (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>).</p><p>To identify meaningful subgroups among the co-authors who have frequently worked together with the profile author on the same publications ( IN 3.4), we employ formal concept analysis (FCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33]</ref>. FCA provides paired sets of co-authors and joint publications (formal concepts) that are maximal both regarding co-authors and publications; that means, there is no other co-author that has also contributed to all identified publications and there is no other publication that has been coauthored by all identified co-authors. To focus on higher-order groups of co-authors and substantial collaboration, we discard formal concepts with less than two co-authors (n &lt; 2) and less than three publications (m &lt; 3). For all other formal concepts, we compute a score √ n • m that rates both larger groups and groups with more publications higher. We apply a mitigating transform on the number of co-authors √ n because otherwise large groups of co-authors with only few publications might dominate the scores. This ranking results in an ordered list of groups of co-authors. However, groups in the list might significantly overlap with respect to co-authors, for instance, one being a subgroup of the other. Since we want to avoid listing similar groups, we sweep through the list and discard all groups that share a high similarity with any of the previously listed groups (Jaccard coefficient of ≥ 1/3 comparing the two sets of co-authors). Among the list of groups sorted based on score, we select the top two groups according to Equation 1 for presenting in the profile text along with the number of joint publications and research topics. A longer list of collaboration groups and the group publications is available on demand and is presented in the sidebar.</p><p>Whereas only the most frequent collaborations are described in the text, the diagram showing the co-author publication timeline below the text (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>) allows for exploration of all collaborations in detail. It displays distributions of the co-author's publications per year (gray) as well as those joint with the profile author (red) on a timeline. The timeline begins with the starting year of the most senior author in the visible co-authors with a vertical red line pointing at the starting year of profile author. The active spans of co-authors are marked with light gray background. The More button allows for expanding the list. The number in parenthesis after the co-author's name shows the number of joint publications. The gray and red bars are selectable, and the respective publications are displayed in the sidebar. This visualization provides an easy way to explore temporal variations in the collaborations, possible shift of collaborators from one co-author to another, and the span of joint work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">APPLICATION EXAMPLES</head><p>Mirroring the two initial motivating scenarios (cf. Section 2.2), we explore two use cases for our approach. They demonstrate and test the approach in a realistic setting. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S1 -Recruiting</head><p>In this use case, we simulate a recruiting process for an academic position. To have a specific scenario that fits our scope, we assume to recruit an associate-level professor for a position in visualization research, embedded into a research institute on human-computer interaction at a university with a certain focus on geoscience. The candidate should hold a PhD degree and afterwards have already developed an independent research agenda. Experience in supervising and interdisciplinary research would be counted as an advantage. Considering the specialization of our hypothetic institute and university, cross-links to human-computer interaction and geoscience would be a good fit. Further evaluation criteria are an active role in publishing with a special focus on visualization as well as having a broad collaboration network. Since we are evaluating personal achievements of individual researchers, we anonymize the discussed reports.</p><p>Data Sampling: To draft realistic candidates, we randomly sample the authors in our data set (in a real scenario, these would be the submitters of an application). For each candidate, we identify the category to which the author belongs based on the author personas. We only include authors who fall between categories researcher and senior researchers as candidates because they are at the targeted stage of career. This simulates a preselection where less fitting candidates are excluded. We restrict our sample to three candidates for sake of brevity. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref> lists the respective anonymized profiles.</p><p>Results: The badges give a first impression on the candidates, having a total number of publications ( IN 1.1) between 10 and 30 (bronze badge, Candidate 2) or between 30 and 100 (silver badge, Candidate 1 and 3), and being active ( IN 1.2) at least ten years (silver badge). Distinguished from the other candidates, Candidate 1 already has documented experience in supervising ( Conclusion: Judging from their generated profiles, Candidate 1 might be the most promising applicant due to experience and fit of topics. However, the differences are nearly balanced. Candidate 2 would even better fit topic-wise, while Candidate 3 is youngest with respect to academic age and has a more quickly growing record of publications. Hence, a recommendation would be to invite all three candidates for a job interview. As is common in some countries, a follow up step could be to find independent reviewers for the candidates among the authors with similar research interests ( IN 2.4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S2 -Assessing Expertise</head><p>The second application example plays through organizing a new workshop on a visualization topic, biological visualization for the sake of demonstration. The workshop should cover various topics of biological visualization, including scientific visualization like protein representations as well as visual analytics approaches and information visualizations for biological networks. One important task is finding candidates for the program committee, which is an instance of the described scenario of assessing expertise (S2). We aim at inviting a small committee of 10 candidates. They should have good expertise in the area and academic experience at least on researcher level.</p><p>Data Sampling: We start with randomly sampling authors to find currently active researchers who have both contributed to visualization and bioinformatics, until we have collected a starting set of six seed authors. In a real setting, this starting set could as well come from random sampling, but also from personal recommendations or from keyword searches in digital libraries. We use the author similarity ( IN 2.4) and co-author relationships ( IN 3.1) to expand the list of candidates (not following transitive connections because we would sample many too similar candidates). This procedure resulted in a set  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">IN 2.3)</ref>, we rate the experience in three levels (+, ++, and +++). We also list the visualization subfield covered by the authors as described in the text <ref type="figure">( IN 2.2)</ref>. Further, we also judge the experience with respect to bioinformatics by studying the respective publications ( IN 2.1). <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 2</ref> presents the resulting invitation list, while an extended list of all sampled authors and all related reports are available as part of the interactive appendix document.</p><p>Conclusion: The approach helped quickly finding committee candidates that are sufficiently experienced and well balanced between the two targeted communities. While some candidates are equally active in both fields, we have selected a few candidates who are specialists in one field with only occasional contributions in the other. Also, the candidates cover all subfields of visualization. The procedure furthermore yielded four secondary candidates (see interactive appendix) who could be invited if some of the primary candidates would decline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">DISCUSSION</head><p>We have demonstrated that our approach fulfills the required information needs, but there are also other aspects to discuss that are either strengths or limitations of the approach. Thinking beyond the specific example of the presented system, we also make suggestions for the application and generalization of the approach to other domains.</p><p>Selection of Information: A strength of our approach is that it only shows information available in a sufficient quality and quantity. For instance, we do not speculate on research topics of an author if keyword information is only available for a single publication. Of course, such checks can be included also into other approaches. However, in a tabular or visual representation such missing information might cause confusion. In text, it seems more natural to only focus on those things that are most relevant and reliable. One might argue that this selection takes away the user's control, but we counterbalance by providing explanations and making the underlying data available on demand.</p><p>Data Scope: The scope of our work is restricted to publication data. We did not yet include related information such as affiliations, citation information, or awards. Whereas reliable data available is a challenge, adding paragraphs for this information to the author profiles would be a natural extension. Unlike table-based or visualization approaches, where adding more data aspects could result in a more cluttered representation, the growth of a textual description usually does not reduce how self-explaining or understandable it is. In some cases, author profiles are inaccurate because publications of several people with the same name are mixed-DBLP often (not always) provides a correct name disambiguation reflected in additional indices attached to the author name.</p><p>Evaluation: The assessment of existing approaches and the application examples demonstrate that our approach fills a relevant gap and produces useful results in realistic scenarios. The first example (S1 -Recruiting) demonstrates the usefulness of our approach in an explanatory scenario. The second example (S2 -Assessing Expertise) shows the exploratory analysis aspect of our tool that can be used to identify researchers working on similar topics. However, we cannot yet claim that our approach performs better than a purely table-based or visualization-based representation. For such comparison, we will need to first develop the other representations showing equivalent information and optimize each as we have optimized the presented approach. Then, we can perform a user study comparing the three representations. While a quantitative study could answer which of the representations is best in terms of accuracy and answer times, a qualitative approach could also reflect on how self-explaining the representations are and how the users work with them. Furthermore, textual explanations might influence the way users interpret the visualizations. Whereas a recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> investigates the effect of diagram titles on the interpretation of visualizations, the impact of longer textual explanations on the accompanying visualizations remains yet to be explored.</p><p>Applicability: In our approach, we use the generated textual representation as a primary entity to demonstrate the capabilities of this rarely leveraged representation. However, we do not argue that our representation needs to replace conventional list-based author records or author visualizations. On the contrary, our technique would be simple to apply in various contexts, for instance, as an introductory text of an author profile in a digital library or as a detail description of an author node in a co-author network visualization. Following this idea, our technique could enrich existing approaches without the threat that the additional information would clutter the interface. Moreover, the generated texts are rather likely to make a formal representation more self-explaining and understandable.</p><p>Generalizability: We have developed a specific solution for a specific data set and domain. Despite some tailoring for the visualization community, most of the generated text would still work for other DBLP publication data. Increasing with difference in publication culture, more adaptation would become necessary when switching to other fields. For instance, some research communities might use alphabetic ordering of authors that renders our current algorithm unable to identify supervisor relationships. Still, the seniority check in our approach (supervisor is at least five years senior than the supervisee) holds across publication cultures and might convey this information to some extent. Whereas developing a system uniting various sciences might be challenging, tailored solutions for specific fields are straightforward to derive. Only the phrasing of the text and calibration of algorithms might need to be adapted. In a similar way, we can also build profile pages for actors, musicians, software developers, or other people taking part in public life. The only requirement is that these people work together and contribute to specific work items.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION</head><p>We presented a novel approach to use natural language text combined with visualizations for presenting an author-centric analysis of publication records. This visualization-text integration led to the development of VIS Author Profiles, a Web-based visual analytics tool to explore the profiles of researchers. It provides an easy-to-use and self-explanatory interface for understanding publication statistics, research interests, and collaboration networks. A distinguishing feature is the interactive linking of text and visualizations where text explicitly describes the most important patterns and visualization allows for contextual exploration of publication records. We demonstrated the approach in two realistic scenarios. Although designed for a specific domain, it can be extended to other scientific communities and excerpts of the generated text might be integrated into other systems and visualizations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>IN</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>

The first paragraph provides more detailed information like exact publication counts (28-40, IN 1.1), year of the first publication (2004-2008, IN 1.2) and temporal publication distribution (stable to growing, IN 1.2), as well as the balance between journal and proceedings publications (slight preference on journal articles for all candidates, IN 1.1)-the candidates perform relatively similar with respect to these measures. All candidates also published a good share of publications as first authors, indicating a successful doctoral (and postdoctoral) work phase ( IN 1.3). With respect to topics described in the second paragraph, all candidates are frequent and recently active contributors of the visualization community ( IN 2.1), with similar focus ( IN 2.2) on information visualization and visual analytics (Candidate 3 also has some experience in scientific visualization). They all share an interest in the evaluation of visualization as well as human-computer interaction ( IN 2.1), while Candidate 1 seems to have published most in the latter as can be retrieved when clicking on the keyword. Candidate 2 has also considerably published in the desired secondary field of geoscience. The co-author visualizations of all three candidates show that they have been publishing frequently with various experienced researchers ( IN 3.2), but did not rely on a single main collaborator ( IN 3.1) or subgroup of co-authors ( IN 3.4).
