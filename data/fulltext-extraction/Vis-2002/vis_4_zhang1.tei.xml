			<abstract>
				<p>This paper presents a new technique for the extraction of surfaces from 3D ultrasound data. Surface extraction from ultrasound data is challenging for a number of reasons including noise and artifacts in the images and non-uniform data sampling. A method is proposed to fit an approximating radial basis function to the group of data samples. An explicit surface is then obtained by iso-surfacing the function. In most previous 3D ultrasound research, a pre-processing step is taken to interpolate the data into a regular voxel array and a corresponding loss of resolution. We are the first to represent the set of semi-structured ultrasound pixel data as a single function. From this we were able to extract surfaces without first reconstructing the irregularly spaced pixels into a regular 3D voxel array.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Research into 3D medical imaging has been ongoing for several decades. Considerable success has been found in visualizing 3D magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) images. Algorithms to extract surfaces of the skin, bone and many organs are well developed for the relatively low noise, structured MR and CT data <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>. Surface extraction from 3D ultrasound (3DUS) has been a more challenging problem.</p><p>3D US has a number of peculiar properties that inhibit surface extraction. First, the ultrasound images contain a significant amount of speckle and artifacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>. The images also show a strong directionality -the distinctiveness of boundaries depends on the viewing direction and therefore placement of the hand-held probe <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>. 3D freehand ultrasound -the most common technique -is based on acquisition of a set of 2D cross-sectional ultrasound images <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">26]</ref>. What is also required is a sensor on the hand-held probe that measures that probe's spatial position and orientation. With such a system, a sonographer moves the sensorized probe over a region of interest. Typically a single organ is scanned from tip to tail. The set of acquired images, together with the sensor readings, comprise a 3D US data set. An example of a 3D freehand US data set is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. Although each cross-sectional image is composed of regularly spaced pixels, the spacing between images is irregular because it is determined by the sonographer's hand motion. The last issue is a main reason why many standard surface Most previous work on surface extraction in MR and CT assumes that the data lies on a regular 3D grid of volume elementshereafter called a voxel array, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>. Although freehand US data can be interpolated into a voxel array, a loss of resolution normally results <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>. Nevertheless a short summary of voxel-based surface extraction methods is presented here. The previous work can be classified into several main categories: marching algorithms, level set methods, and contour connecting methods.</p><p>There are several existing methods for surface extraction. The Marching Cubes technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref> and its variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">23]</ref>have been the most popular approach to extract isodensity surface from volume data; it produces triangles within voxels that contain the surface. The main difficulty associated with this approach is that no variety of the algorithm exists for scattered data.</p><p>An alternative type of approach is to use parameterized curves and surfaces. This approach has been most widely used in 3D images, where they are known as snakes or active contours. These models were first introduced by Terzopoulos et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14]</ref>, and have been widely used, for instance, see the balloon models of Cohen and Cohen <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and the active contour models of Blake and Isard <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. By interpolating contours from ultrasound image slices, a surface could be reconstructed. An important difficulty with these models is good initialization; once initialized they work well for tracking. Initialization is often performed manually and accurate tracking depends on optimizing a number of parameters to the characteristics of the image.</p><p>There are some available methods for extracting implicit surfaces from unorganized point clouds, for instance, from laser scanners <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Implicit surfaces methods like Level Set method <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20]</ref> and Radial Basis Function <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> extract the zero isocontour from a signed distance function. The surface is embedded as a (zero) level set of a higher dimensional function. Our approach is closest to these methods, but differs in that we work directly with intensity data rather constructing a density based on signed distance functions.</p><p>We propose in this paper to construct a surface directly from the freehand US data without first interpolating into a voxel array. In this paper we will describe:</p><p>• a new 3D freehand acquisition system</p><p>• a method for fitting a function to noisy ultrasound pixel data</p><p>• a method to calculate an explicit surface from the function</p><p>• the application of such methods to anatomy imaged in vivo  The Ultrasonix machine consists of a standard ultrasound probe that is connected to a generic PC through programmable hardware. The PC contains software for ultrasound signal processing and a high-quality monitor to display the resulting images. With an open architecture, the various stages of image formation can be directly accessed. The visualization work described in this paper is the first project to be undertaken on the Ultasonix machine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">3D FREEHAND ULTRASOUND</head><p>We use the OPTOTRAK 3020 2 as the tracking device. The OP-TOTRAK 3020 is an trinocular system, which consists of three calibrated CCD cameras arranged linearly. It measures 3D motion and position by tracking markers attached to a probe. As the probe moves, OPTOTRAK detects the positions of the infrared LED markers and simultaneously calculates the precise 3D position for each marker. The maximum inaccuracy of 3D markers' position is less than 0.1mm, but overall system accuracy is determined mainly by calibration. We calibrate our probe with the Z-wire phantom <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig.  3</ref>. The goal of calibration is to determine the transformation matrix from 2D ultrasound image coordinates to 3D probe coordinates. With a wisely designed Z-wire phantom, corresponding points can be easily found from the ratio property of similar triangles, which then define the transform matrix. The overall system accuracy is approximately 1mm.</p><p>Several objects, including a real human hand, were used in our surface extraction experiments. In order to avoid the deformation caused by contact of probe with human hand, we scan the hand in a water bath. Because the difference between water and human tissue is relatively small, ultrasound is able to penetrate through the skin into internal tissues. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Ultrasound image of a finger cross section. 1 the noise and speckle; 2 the skin surface, which is a bright boundary; 3 the bone surface; 4 the vein; 5 interior of bone, since ultrasound can not penetrate inside the bone, this is a dark region in the image In ultrasound images, organ boundaries produce higher intensity echoes than surrounding areas. These echoes result in pixels with higher grey-level values in the image. See <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> for an example of intensity distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">SURFACE MODELLING</head><p>Another challenge for surface extraction from ultrasound images lies where there is a steep vertical slope. The vertical section will cause a break on the ultrasound images, as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. An effective surface extraction method should be able to smoothly interpolate across these missing parts by using neighboring data.</p><p>The 3D data can be represented with a single function f (x, y, z). The surface is implicitly described as the set of points (x, y, z) where the function attains a constant level equal to the echo inten- <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>: Ultrasound images of toy duck, note the gaps at two indicated positions. The gap exists because the vertical section of the boundary cannot reflect ultrasound. sity at the organ boundary. An explicit representation -in the form of a mesh of polygons -can also be extracted by an iso-surfacing algorithm (such as Marching Cubes).</p><p>More formally:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">given function values fi at N distinct points xi(xi, yi, zi) find the function f (x, y, z) such that f (xi, yi, zi) = fi for i = 1, .., N. This is a classic interpolation problem.</formula><p>Then a surface is desired where f (x, y, z) attains a level of kthe echo intensity at the organ boundary. The surface is obtained by an iso-surfacing algorithm that fits a mesh of polygons to the surface where f (x, y, z) = k.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RADIAL BASIS FUNCTION INTERPOLA-TION</head><p>Radial basis functions (RBF's) are proposed for f (x, y, z). There are several reasons for this choice:</p><p>• Compact description of a single function;</p><p>• Can interpolate sparse, non-uniformly spaced data;</p><p>• Can both interpolate and approximate data;</p><p>• Can be evaluated anywhere to generate meshes of desired resolution;</p><p>• Gradients and higher derivatives can be calculated analytically. These are also continuous and smooth depending on the choice of basis functions;</p><p>• Surface normals are easily computed;</p><p>• Iso-surfaces extracted from RBF's are manifold (i.e. non selfintersecting).</p><p>Traditional RBF's require O(N 3 ) arithmetic operations for fitting, so the computational complexity rapidly increases as the data set size increases. Also the system of equations is not always well conditioned. For these two reasons, direct solution of this equation is impractical for any data sets larger than a few thousand points. We propose that new fast methods for RBF's are feasible for this problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Fast RBF methods were developed recently for surface reconstruction from laser range finger data. In that problem, surface points (xi, yi, zi) were given and a function f (x, y, z) was desired such that f (x, y, z) = 0 on the surface. To solve that problem (for non trivial solutions), off surface points were introduced artificially along with a signed-distance function. This resulted in the expanded problem:f (xi, yi, zi) = 0 for on-surface points, and f (xi, yi, zi) = di (not equals 0) for off surface points, where di is the estimate of the signed distance to the surface. We adopt this formulation to our problem of fitting RBF's to pixel data. But instead of using di as "off-surface distance", we substitute the intensity of the pixel. Then, instead of iso-surfacing at zero, we iso-surface at the mean intensity of the boundary.</p><p>Consider a set of 3D points xi, i = 1, .., N have the intensity values pi. The basic idea of Radial Basis Function interpolation is to find a spline S(x) that fits the data points as smoothly as possible. With this constraint, we find the S(x) that minimizes</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">N i=1 |pi − S(xi)| 2 + ωI(s)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The first term is the deviation of the spline from the data points, which represents the interpolation error. The second term, I(s), is a smoothness function of surface s, normally chosen to minimize one or more partial derivatives of the function. ω is the weight which determines the relative cost of this two components. ω = 0 means that the RBF solution fit the given centers perfectly, without any smoothing. The general solution can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S(x) = t(x) + N i=1 λiR(|x, xi|)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where The solution can be written in matrix form as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">A T T T 0 λ c = p 0<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Ai,j = R(|xi, xj|), i, j = 1, ..., N Ti,j = tj(xi), i = 1, ..., N, j = 1, ..., l</formula><p>p is the vector of intensity of pixels pi, {t1, . . . , t l } is a basis for polynomials, and λ is a vector of the coefficients λi in equation 2.</p><p>In 3D, the biharmonic spline case gives c = (c1, c2, c3, c4)</p><p>T is the matrix with ith row <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(1, xi, yi, zi)</ref>, and l -the degree of this polynomial -equals 4 here. When we take weight ω into consideration in Equation 1. Equation 3 can be modified as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">A + ωI T T T 0 λ c = p 0<label>(4)</label></formula><p>For our experiments, ω is adjusted to smooth the speckle components of the ultrasound iamges. Beatson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> propose a fast fitting and evaluation algorithm based on the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>. For an evaluation point, FMM computes an approximate evaluation for those points far from it, while using direct evaluation for those near it. A predefined evaluation accuracy can be selected to divide all points into  <ref type="table">907  475  58s  70s  Duck II  99,087  545  1047s  391s  Hand I  9,920  156  50s  73s  Hand II  99,479  209  1340s  765s   Table 1</ref>: Comparison of RBF fitting times on a 1GHz Intel P3 with 1GB RAM the two categories. Fitting accuracy is another parameter we can adjust in this formulation. It is specified as the maximum allowed deviation of RBF values at interpolation points. Both storage and computation can be significantly decreased with suitable values for fitting accuracy and evaluation accuracy.</p><p>As an additional way to speed computation, the number of data points is reduced selectively. In most cases, a small subset of centers is able to produce the same approximation as the original input data points. Though it adds additional computation, center reduction brings the benefit of smaller memory requirements and faster evaluation time without losing accuracy. In our experimental approach, we also perform an automatic pre-processing step to further trim the data and improve computational performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">AUTOMATIC SEGMENTATION</head><p>The goal of the automatic segmentation algorithm is to trim pixels far from the estimated boundary of the surface. There is no need to have a high level of accuracy at this stage. The only need is to avoid removing pixels that depict the boundary. As described in previous sections, we use the intensity value of the pixels as a quasi distance function in the calculation of the radial basis function coefficients. It is therefore important to also extract pixels that are nearby the boundary. For both of these reasons, the desired segmentation consists of a band of pixels surrounding the boundary in each ultrasound image.</p><p>The perform this, an initial segmentation is drawn by the user on the first image and a simple tracker is used to automatically propagate the segmentation to the following frames. The simple tracker is guided by the presence of boundary features that follow the boundary as it changes from image to image. The features that are used here are edgels (edge elements) detected along each column of pixels. Edges are detected along columns because each image is created from ultrasound echoes that travel in the vertical direction. Thus the physics of ultrasound image creation suggests that edges are best detected along vertical lines.</p><p>Edgels are identified by large gradients. The largest M such gradients are selected in each image, where M is smaller than the number of columns. This reduces the number of occasional false edgels around speckle or other artifacts.</p><p>The segmentation region is propatated by the following algorithm:</p><p>For each image i: In this way, the segmentation region propagates smoothly from image to image without deviations into regions far from the boundary. All pixels that fall within the segmented areas are then used as the inputs to the RBF interpolation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">SURFACE EXTRACTION</head><p>Once the RBF weights are calculated, the next step is to create an explicit surface along iso-values. Conventional surface extraction methods such as Marching Cubes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref> are optimized for visualizing a complete volume data, which creates a large number of poor aspect ratio triangles. Some mesh simplification algorithms like Vertex Clustering can significantly reduce the number of triangles but not in general maintain the topology. Treece <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref> proposes a Regularized Marching Tetrahedra which combines Marching Tetrahedra and Vertex Clustering to generate an iso-surfaces with smaller number of triangles of improved aspect ratio, and still keep the topology consistency. Treece's method was adopted by J.Carr et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and is also used here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">RESULTS</head><p>Two examinations were performed. The first was an examination of an artificial phantom based on a toy duck. The second was an examination of the human hand scanned in vivo. In the phantom examination, the duck was scanned in two sweeps because the cross-section of the duck was larger than the field of view of the ultrasound probe. The first sweep of the duck imaged the head, starting from the nose. The second sweep imaged the torso, from chest to tail. The hand examination was done in three sweeps.</p><p>The automatic segmentation algorithm was then applied to the data sets to get a reasonable computation time. In fact, additional pruning was also performed to see the effect of large data reduction on surface quality. To do this, pixels from the set of images were randomly deleted. A small amount of deletion resulted in the "high resolution" data set, and larger amount of deletion resulted in the "low resolution" data set. A similar process was undertaken on the hand examination. Some statistics of the computational demands are listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Retaining more than 100k points only serves to highlight the speckle (noise) on surface, although retaining less than 10k points starts to remove surface features. So in practice, this must be done carefully; this could cause the surface to be artificially trimmed more than what would be acceptable in clinical practice. We see that fitting time follows the expected O(n log n) complexity.  The results of the duck phantom examination are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig.  6. Fig. 6</ref>(a) and 6(b) show the phantom and the point cloud of the input data. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 6</ref>(c) and 6(d) show the surface extracted from the low resolution and high resolution data respectively. In both cases, the iso-surfacing was performed at a resolution of 0.5mm, and a isovalue of 50 (between the background intensity level of approximately 15 and the boundary intensity of approximately 130).</p><p>These results represent the first time that RBF functions have been fit to non-regular 3D ultrasound density data for surface extraction. In both cases the extracted surface clearly resembles the actual surface. But notice two obvious problems. First the presence of ultrasound speckle -inherent to all ultrasound imagesresults in a bumpy surface. Second, misalignment of some of the ultrasound images creates vertical creases in the surface. The second problem is peculiar to the type of 3D ultrasound used in this study. Freehand ultrasound relies upon the external position sensors to align the images. Freehand ultrasound also takes many seconds to perform a sweep of an object. Any miscalibration of the system or movement of the object during the sweep results in misalignment of the images. For the duck phantom, miscalibration is the dominant error., but the hand examination contains both object motion and miscalibration. Improvements to calibration will likely reduce the misalignment significantly. Moreover, ultrasound scanner manufacturers are now researching 3D ultrasound acquisition systems with two main differences from freehand systems: electronically controlled image direction and real-time acquisition rates. The direct control of imaging direction eliminates the miscalibration problem with external sensors and the faster acquisition rate (up to 16 sweeps per second) reduces object motion error. Therefore these sources of error can be expected to be eliminated in future 3D ultrasound systems.</p><p>Nevertheless, the RBF's depict the actual surface. They have filled the gaps between the sweeps (especially in the neck region) and filled the gaps along the boundary in a single image (especially where the wing attaches to the torso). This is true for both the low resolution ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 6(c)</ref>) and high resolution ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 6(d)</ref>) results. Notice that the lower resolution result loses some small surface detail but, as expected, retains the larger features.</p><p>Figures 6(d) -6(f) show the effect of smoothing. One purpose of smoothing is to reduce the effect of speckle, and is easily implemented with the RBF formulation. The speckle size is a function of the spatial resolution of the ultrasound images. The medium level of smoothing was chosen to minimize speckle without losing spatial resolution. The axial resolution is approximately 0.4mm (calculated using a two cycle pulse from the 7M Hz probe 3 ), and the lateral and elevational resolution are approximately 1 − 2mm (depending on proximity to the focal point). The medium level of smoothing also avoids aliasing. Notice that the medium smoothing removes speckle with a minimal loss of other features, such as the detail of the features in the wings. Large level of smoothing starts to remove these small features, as this level of smoothing, begin to exceed the spatial resolution. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 7</ref> shows the ability to extract multiple surfaces from a single volumetric ultrasound data set. Here we attempt to extract the inner surface in addition to the outer surface (from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 6</ref>). Since the toy duck is made from a constant thickness material, the inner surface is expected to be similar to the outer surface. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 7(b)</ref> confirms this is the case.  surfaces clearly resemble the actual skin surface. Although both speckle and misalignment artifacts are visible, the RBF smoothing minimizes the effect of speckle. The misalignment is slightly more pronounced here because of small hand tremor during acquisition. As already mentioned, the misalignment errors can be eliminated with upcoming 3D ultrasound systems. Because the internal structures are not distinguishible in the ultrasound images, extraction of interior surfaces was not attempted. Scanners with higher frequency, higher resolution probes should reveal the bony structures more clearly making their surface extraction feasible. It is worthwhile to compare our method to alternative methods. For example an approach with 3 steps: 1. Segment 2D images for boundary; 2. Triangulate directly on convex hull of these points; 3. Apply a smoothing algorithm. This approach such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, used in 3D surface finding when data is already in form of scattered points . But here, step 1 to extract boundary points is non trivial in general. For reasons explained in the section 1, reliable extraction of boundary points is unlikely to be successful. The RBF's working directly on boundary and non-boundary pixels perform more robust segmentation.</p><p>A limitation that RBF fitting and isosurfacing shares with other surface extraction methods is the fine-tuning of the various parameters. In our case we selected the form of the RBF and adjusted the smoothing or fitting accuracy, level of center reduction, the confidence we have in selecting the input pixels, resolution of surface and the surface isovalue. Fortunately, in these experiments, the resulting surfaces were not very sensitive to these parameters, although they need to be set manually.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have shown, for the first time, how to represent the set of semistructured ultrasound pixel data as a single function. From this we were able to extract surfaces without first reconstructing the irregularly spaced pixels into a regular 3D voxel array. We have shown that the pixels data can be represented by a single function by using fast fitting and evaluation techniques for radial basis functions. We have adapted recent advances in fast RBF's to the special problems encountered in medical 3D ultrasound. The process is demonstrated on both artificial phantoms, as well as human skin surfaces obtained in vivo.</p><p>Although we have readily extracted surfaces from water-tank experiments, the more general problem of extracting organ or bone surfaces from a wide variety of 3D ultrasound scans is still unresolved. Our use of RBF's has resolved some issues such as resolution loss in voxel array reconstruction and bridging gaps. yet other artifacts such as speckle and shadow will still affect the qualify of the results.</p><p>In future work, we expect to concentrate on these areas:</p><p>• Larger data sets with improved resolution and calibration.</p><p>• Both water-skin boundaries as well as soft-tissue and bone boundaries;</p><p>• Other medical imaging modalities such as CT and MR;</p><p>• Comparison to existing techniques;</p><p>• Reconstruction of both front and back sides.

There are several choices for the basis function. The format depends on choice of I(s). The biharmonic spline R(r) = r, (r = |x, xi|) is well suited to the representation of 3D objects. It can be characterized as the smoothest interpolation of data, in the sense that it is the interpolant which minimizes the integral of the 2nd derivative.</figDesc></figure>
