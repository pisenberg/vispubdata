				<p>For quantitative examination of phenomena that simultaneously occur on very different spatial and temporal scales, adaptive hierarchical schemes are required. A special numerical multilevel technique, associated with a particular hierarchical data structure, is so-called Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR). It allows one to bridge a wide range of spatial and temporal resolutions and therefore gains increasing popularity. We describe the interplay of several visualization and VR software packages for rendering time dependent AMR simulations of the evolution of the first star in the universe. The work was done in the framework of a television production for DISCOVERY CHANNEL TELEVISION, &quot;The Unfolding Universe.&quot;. Parts of the data were taken from one of the most complex AMR simulation ever carried out: It contained up to 27 levels of resolution, requiring modifications to the texture based AMR volume rendering algorithm that was used to depict the density distribution of the gaseous interstellar matter. A voice and gesture controlled CAVE application was utilized to define camera paths following the interesting features deep inside the computational domains. Background images created from cosmological computational data were combined with the final renderings.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In numerical analysis, hierarchical techniques for local refinement have become more and more popular, since they produce more reliable results and allow one to simulate more complex phenomena. A special scheme is Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), introduced by Berger et al. in the 1980's <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In this approach a hierarchy of nested grids is generated, representing relevant regions of the computational domain on different levels of resolution. The numerical technique is applied in many domains like hydrodynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, meteorology <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and in particular in astrophysics <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</p><p>This paper reports on a collaboration between physicists and computer scientists in rendering time dependent AMR data of the * Contact: Ralf Kähler: kaehler@zib.de, Hans-Christian Hege: hege@zib.de, Donna <ref type="bibr">Cox:</ref> cox@ncsa.uiuc.edu, Robert Patterson: robertp@ncsa.uiuc.edu, Stuart Levy: slevy@ncsa.uiuc.edu, Tom Abel: Hi@tomabel.com evolution of the first star in the universe, starting with its formation out of gaseous interstellar matter up to its spectacular death in a supernova explosion. Parts of the data contained up to 27 levels of refinement, resolving an initial coarse computational domain of several thousand light years down to the region the newborn protostar. A texture based algorithm for AMR data, implemented in the 3D visualization environment AMIRA <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, was applied and extended to render the 3D density distribution of the interstellar gas. The voice and gesture controlled CAVE application VIRTUAL DI-RECTOR <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> was utilized to define camera paths following the interesting features in the hierarchies. Background images were created using cosmological computational data with the STAR REN-DERER, developed by Loren Carpenter at Pixar Animation Studios <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Parts of the resulting renderings were broadcasted on the DIS-COVERY CHANNEL program "The Unfolding Universe", aired in June 2002.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Still only a small number of papers deal with rendering methods for AMR data. A back-to-front cell-sorting algorithm for AMR hierarchies utilized for volume rendering was presented by Max <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.

This algorithm was chosen for rendering in this collaboration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">AMR SIMULATION</head><p>The first star datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> were computed with the AMR code ENZO <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, designed for high-resolution cosmological structure formation simulations. The simulations follow the hydrodynamics, gravity of the gas and the dark matter, the chemical rate equations describing the non-equilibrium chemistry of the formation of ions and molecules, as well as all relevant radiative processes. The simulation starts at about 400,000 years after the big bang and evolves it for approximately 200 million years (dataset I, see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). The initial coarse grid, representing the root node of the hierarchical data structure, covered a computational domain of about 18, 000 light years. In regions with mass densities above some threshold, finer subgrids are created as child nodes of the root grid. Together they define a new level of the hierarchy, increasing the resolution of their parent grid by the so-called refinement factor (of 2 in this case). This process repeats recursively on the newly defined subgrids. These subgrids are axis-aligned, structured rectilinear meshes, consisting of hexahedral cells with constant edge lengths. Subgrids are completely contained within their parent grids, and they begin and end on parent cell boundaries, which implies that parent grid cells are either completely refined or completely unrefined. The data values are stored at the centers of the cells (cellcentered).</p><p>To visualize the formation of the first star we zoom into the static dataset of an equal but further evolved simulation of the same type (dataset II, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>). The simulations show that a single massive star is formed per proto-galactic object of about 10 6 solar masses. Stars of this size are known to die in a supernova. Dataset III, the result of simulation of this supernova explosion, shows the evolution of a dense shell that is formed and which expands very rapidly (c.f. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DEFINITION OF CAMERA PATHS</head><p>To analyze the AMR data and create camera paths to highlight the interesting aspects for the widescreen visualization, the team used VIRTUAL DIRECTOR in NCSA's room sized CAVE immersive VR environment. VIRTUAL DIRECTOR is a voice and wand gesture controlled application for navigation and camera choreography, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>. For smooth VR interaction, we needed a lightweight subset of the AMR data. Since the AMR computation naturally creates refined grids in dense regions, animated wireframe boxes of the grid domains provided a very good guide to visually interesting areas for the star-formation scenes, where opacity was derived from gas density, see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Display toggles for each level of grids aids in reducing visual clutter. In the supernova scene <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 4</ref>), the tem- perature field was the visually appropriate one; but it was poorly correlated with density, and AMR grid placement was less helpful. Temperature-colored particles from a subset of grid cells served as an interactive guide.</p><p>Due to the dramatic range of scale inherent in the data, controlling the user's scale is crucial. VIRTUAL DIRECTOR allows the user to shrink down to a very small virtual size, enabling controlled flight around the tiny birthing protostar, or to become large enough to reach across the 18,000 light year data set. The proper scale enables the user to make sense of the data when immersed within the nested domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">VOLUME RENDERING THE AMR DATA</head><p>Here we will briefly describe the volume rendering algorithm utilized for rendering the interstellar matter distribution and its application to the AMR simulation data specified in section 3. For more details of this algorithm, refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>To obtain smooth images, the data was rendered using trilinear interpolation. In a preprocessing step the cell-centered hierarchy was resampled to a vertex-centered one to avoid visual artifacts due to discontinuities of the interpolation function at grid boundaries. Since some regions are covered by (overlapping) grids on different levels of resolution, the computational domain is partitioned into disjoint axis-aligned regions (bricks) consisting of equal-sized cells: either regions that are not covered by subgrid cells, or regions that are completely refined by subgrid cells. The space decomposition results in a kD-tree subdivision of the domain.</p><p>For each subgrid of the AMR hierarchy a separate one channel 3D texture (using OpenGL's colortable extension) is allocated and a data structure storing texture offset and space partition information is allocated for each node of the kD-tree. This tree structure is utilized for traversing the separate bricks in a view-consistent order, starting at the root node. Each brick is rendered similar to the standard approach for volume rendering with 3D textures as for example proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, i.e. by sampling the 3D texture on slices perpendicular to the viewing direction, followed by a blending step in the frame buffer.</p><p>For rendering the 27 level dataset II (c.f. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>) with equidistant slices without missing the shells of the star on the highest refinement levels, about 8 × 10 9 slices would have been necessary. This of course is not feasible and hence the slice distance was adapted to the actual resolution of the underlying cells. For bricks on the root level a number of 700 slices was chosen, bricks on the higher levels were rendered with respectively more.</p><p>This varying slice distance usually necessitates opacity corrections to the colormap, for example by adjusting the opacity values α l for each level l according to</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">α l = 1 − (1 − α0) r −l ,</formula><p>where r is the relative refinement factor between two consecutive levels. Due to the enormous number of levels for this dataset, these corrections lead to a large number of truncated alpha values for the higher levels, due to the limited number of bits per channel in the frame buffer (12 bits in our case). Since this resulted in visible artifacts at the higher-level regions, we decided not do apply the opacity corrections, but to render each brick with the same colormap. The maps' alpha channel contained separate sharp peaks, resulting in nested, semi-transparent shells in the final images. The position of the alpha peaks could be chosen such that each of the corresponding shells was mostly contained in bricks on the same level of resolution. Therefore the lack of opacity corrections did not create noticeable artifacts at the grid boundaries. Another problem with this dataset was the fact that the distances of the polygon vertices defining the slice segments on the higher levels bricks, were too small to be represented accurately by the internal OpenGL vertex datatypes. This resulted in noticeable cracks and gaps between adjacent slice segments on these levels, in particular after camera rotations. The problem was solved by translating the world coordinates of the geometries in such a way, that the center of the star coincided with the origin of the new coordinate system. Since the density of floating point numbers is higher close to zero and all the boxes of the higher levels were located in a neighborhood of the center of the star, a sufficient precision even for the bricks on the highest levels was obtained.</p><p>The time dependent datasets I and III <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figures 2, 4</ref>) contained fewer levels of resolution (up to 10 for the later timesteps of the simulation). For previewing, colortable and camerapath selection, these datasets were rendered with adaptive slice distances and opacity corrections, as sketched above. In order to render the moving gaseous density distributions, a colortable with exponential, less narrow peaks was chosen. But again, due to the limited precision for the channels in the frame buffer, artifacts at grid boundaries became visible for this colormap at the higher levels. Though not as obvious as for the static dataset, they were noticeable in animated sequences. The final shots therefore were rendered with constant slice distances of about 20,000 slices over the domain covered by the root grid, though the effective number was smaller, since the camera positions were inside the refined regions. This large number of slices decreased the rendering performance to about 0.1 fps, compared to about 1 fps for rendering with varying slice distances, but provided a better image quality.</p><p>Since the underlying AMR grid structure is dynamic, a flickering resulted in regions where the resolution of the highest resolved subgrid changed particularly fast or was even alternating. We reduced this flickering by blending each frame with its predecessor and successor, weighted with 25%, 50% and 25% respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">BACKGROUND COMPOSITION</head><p>A background provides motion cues and enhances the perception of depth in visualization. It is particularly desirable when artistically crafting visualizations for large, general audiences. We chose a background to suit the first-star theme: a simulation of structure formation over a 3.3×100 9 light years volume of the early universe, by Norman, Bryan, and O'Shea, also computed with the AMR code ENZO, but as a pure N-body gravitational calculation. Its periodic boundary conditions allowed tiling many copies of the data to cover the sky smoothly.</p><p>The dark matter was given in particle form; images were created with the STAR RENDERER, a fast gaussian-spot particle renderer from Carpenter of Pixar Animation Studios. Particle velocity, a proxy for mass density, determined the choice of color from a palette of black-body radiation colors. This color scheme is consistent throughout the production visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">RESULTS</head><p>The volume rendering was carried out on a SGI Onyx2 InfiniteRe-ality2 with two RM7 raster managers with 64 MB texture memory. For obtaining pictures with alpha channel, necessary for composition (see section 6), all frames had to be rendered twice. Information about the separate datasets and their rendering times (for a viewport size of 864 × 486 pixels) is given in figure captions 2 to 4.</p><p>We learned from this project that hardware supported, texture based volume rendering can be used for broadcast quality rendering of even highly resolved AMR simulations. Problems arised due to the limited number of bits and thereby limited precision of the framebuffer color channels, as well as the vertex coordinates of the graphics API and graphics hardware respectively.</p><p>The VR environment proved to be extremely helpful for defining smooth camera paths deep inside the computational domains on very diverse spatial scales. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Three out of 1, 350 time steps from dataset I: the formation of the star out of primordial dark matter and gas (mainly hydrogen and helium). The depth of the hierarchy raised from 4 levels of refinement (and several hundred grids) after some hundred time steps, up to 10 levels (and 2, 500 grids) for the later time steps. The resolution of the root grid was 128 × 128 × 128 cells. On average about 30 seconds per timestep was spent for reading in the data, texture allocation, resampling to vertex-centered hierarchies and writing out the images. Rendering took approximately 10 seconds per picture. For each frame two pictures had to be rendered since the composition step needed images with alpha channel.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>IEEE</head><label></label><figDesc>Visualization 2002 Oct. 27 -Nov. 1, 2002, Boston, MA, USA 0-7803-7498-3/02/$17.00 © 2002 IEEE</figDesc></figure>
