			<abstract>
				<p>Data sets from large-scale simulations (up to 501 3 grid points) of mantle convection are analyzed with volume rendering of the temperature field and a new critical point analysis of the velocity field. As the Rayleigh number Ra is increased the thermal field develops increasingly thin plume-like structures along which heat is convected. These eventually break down and become turbulent. Visualization methods are used to distinguish between various models of heat conductivity and to develop an intuitive understanding of the structure of the flow.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Mantle convection is a problem of considerable interest in geophysical fluid dynamics, because of the richness in the physics such as variable properties, in particular the recent work which focusses on variable thermal conductivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Since the late 1980's mantle convection has been modelled in 3-D but at relatively low Rayleigh numbers like 10 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The resolution used at that time was relatively low, on the order of 2 × 10 6 grid points. Recently we have conducted high Rayleigh number calculations with close to 10 8 grid points <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> Variable thermal conductivity introduces new nonlinearities into the temperature equation due to the presence of the square of the temperature gradient, which dominates over the Laplacian of the temperature. These nonliearities are more difficult to solve numerically and require higher spatial resolution than for constant thermal conductivity. The spatial structures of plumes associated with variable thermal conductivity are different from those of constant conductivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In this case study we extend our previous work on high Rayleigh number convection <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to even higher Rayleigh numbers on the order of 10 9 and consider alternative visualization tools and techniques to those used in our previous attempts to visualize mantle convection processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">MATHEMATICAL MODEL</head><p>Mantle convection can be modelled as a fluid at infinite Prandtl number subject to the Boussinesq approximation. The motion of this fluid is solved for in a 3-D Cartesian geometry, with the vertical axis (z) pointing downward ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). The equations of motion are the temperature equation with variable thermal conductivity,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">DT Dt = ∇(κ(T, p)∇T )</formula><p>and the momentum equation (which does not depend on the variable viscosity or conductivity)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∇ 2 u − ∇p − RaT ez = 0, DT</formula><p>Dt is the substantive derivative of temperature, T is the deviation of temperature from a constant reference state, u is the velocity vector, p is the pressure in excess of the hydrostatic value, T is the temperature deviation from the background state, Ra is the Rayleigh number and ez is the unit vector along the z direction which is aligned with the gravity vector. The Rayleigh number Ra = αg∆T d 3 /(νκ) where α is the thermal expansivity, g is the gravitational acceleration, ∆T is the temperature drop across the mantle, d is the depth of the mantle, ν is the kinematic viscosity and κ is the surface value of the thermal diffusivity. As a result of variable conductivity, the terms on the right hand side of the temperature equation are non-linear functions of T as opposed to the simple linear diffusion term in the constant conductivity case. Boundary conditions on temperature are T = 0 at z = 0 (cold top) and T = 1 at z = 1 (heated bottom). The dimensional temperature at the Earth's core-mantle boundary is uncertain and may range between 3200 K to 4500 K <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The physical domain has an aspect-ratio of 4 × 4 × 1 for modelling 3-D mantle convection in a cartesian geometry. This geometric configuration has been used the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> to model dynamics of mantle convection at lower Rayleigh number than the ones considered here. The thermal mantle conductivity has two components, the radiative conductivity and the lattice conductivity. These expressions, given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, are based on experimental phonon lifetimes and reflectance data. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">NUMERICAL METHOD</head><p>The flow is assumed to be periodic in the x − y (horizontal) directions. The grid is uniform in all three directions. We have used an Alternating-Direction-Implicit scheme together with a finite difference method to solve the variable conductivity temperature equation. A Smolarkiewicz/finite-difference scheme is used for the constant conductivity case. The momentum equation is solved in the spectral domain using Fast Fourier Transform along the two horizontal directions and second-order finite-differences in z. Free-slip boundary conditions are imposed on the horizontal surfaces, while the vertical boundaries are impermeable. Data from several simulations are used for this study. A low resolution 97 3 simulation at Ra = 10 6 was chosen to illustrate the time-dependent nature of the data. These simulations (for constant and variable conductivity) were run for 8000 time steps, from which data at 300 time steps was stored and analyzed to study the time evolution of structural information. Two very high resolution simulations at Ra = 10 8 and Ra = 10 9 were conducted at resolutions of 401 3 and 501 3 grid points respectively. This data was generated for constant conductivity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">AMIRA</head><p>We have chosen the visualization package Amira <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> as the tool of choice for the display of complex flows. Similarly to AVS, Iris Explorer, and Data Explorer, Amira is based on interactive flowchart construction from a collection of predefined modules. Amira is built on top of Inventor, which provides facilities for high-level interaction with the data through embedded widgets. Many of the algorithms used in Amira make use of the hardware of current commodity graphics cards. As a result, Amira can manipulate very large data sets very efficiently. For example, it takes under 30 seconds to render a 400 3 data set on a typical 1.7 GHz workstation with 1 Gbyte of memory. Amira is fully extensible through a well-defined object-oriented hierarchy of data structures that define grids and data types. Wrappers around many Inventor features are also provided. The algorithms discussed below have been implemented as Amira modules written by one of the authors. They are imported into Amira and appear as any other Amira module in the visual flowcharts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">THERMAL PLUMES</head><p>One of the fundamental challenges when analyzing flow turbulence is the identification of the so-called coherent structures. These have been defined in many ways, and to date there is still no real consensus. However, one definition that has appeal is to consider a coherent structure as a localized region of the flow that remains correlated over spatial and temporal scales much larger than the scales of the random flow component. Examples of such structures include turbulent spots in wall-bounded flow undergoing transition, hairpin vortices in wall-bounded turbulent flow, and elongated dissipative vortices in isotropic turbulence <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Such structures have been studied extensively, but aside from vortices, there have been very few algorithms developed to extract them. Feature extraction is seen as a necessary component required to successfully handle very large data sets in complex fluids.</p><p>When Ra is sufficiently high, the temperature field develops turbulent characteristics, reminiscent of the turbulent velocity fields found at high Reynolds number. The coherent structures associated with the temperature field are called thermal plumes. They exist at lower Rayleigh numbers, but develop a range of spatial scales as Ra is increased. Plumes play an important role in the dynamics of mantle convection because they determine the style of mantle convection and the global heat transfer. Until recently, the conductivity was assumed to be constant. The visualizations shown herein demonstrate that variable conductivity can change the spatial distribution and the strength of the plumes, thus affecting the dynamical processes through which heat is conducted through the mantle.  The first two images are at early time, the last two at times when the flow has become quasi-stationary. Comparing the constant and variable conductivity cases, we note that when the conductivity is constant, the plumes develop faster and their spatial density is higher. In both cases, the structure of the plumes is approximately constant: their height and shape don't vary much. On the heated plate (bottom), the temperature develops thin structures from which the plumes emanate. A better understanding of these structure is the focus of ongoing research. Qualitatively, the thermal plumes are tube-like; they are primarily vertical and extend from the bottom to the top plate.</p><p>As Ra is increased further, the plumes become thinner and more irregular. When Ra reaches the 10 7 range, the temperature field becomes turbulent <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 4 and 5</ref> show the temperature field at a stage when the flow is quasi-stationary. The plumes have become more irregular, particularly at Ra = 10 9 . Many plumes no longer extend throughout the mantle. To get a better idea of the structure of the plumes, x − z and x − y cross-sections are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figures 6 and 7</ref> respectively. The color maps correspond  to those used in the volume-rendered images, including the transparency component (seen as black on the color maps). This choice of color map is meant to reduce accidental misinterpretation of the images when comparing plume slices and their 3-D representations. The top frame of each figure corresponds to Ra = 10 8 , the bottom frame to Ra = 10 9 . From the x − z profiles, it is immediately apparent that the plumes are thinner at higher Ra. However, the thicker plumes are not immediately apparent from the x − y cuts. What can be deduced through these visualizations is that the plumes originate from the heated plate at the intersections of the "canals" of local temperature maximum. These canals are conduits for the downswelling of colder fluid. The complex structure of the temperature field near the bottom plate at high Ra is directly linked to the higher complexity of the plume structure.</p><p>From these images, we deduce that plumes under high Rayleigh number cover a very small fraction of the 3-D volume, which decreases further at higher Ra, although the plumes lose some of their identity. Thus the problem of visualizing and extracting plumes becomes more difficult at higher Ra. This would have been difficult to ascertain without the aid of advanced visualization software.</p><p>The next step is to develop techniques to extract these plumes and store them separately for analysis. Better understanding of their spatial distribution, their shape, and their volume would provide geoscientists with useful information to help their modelling efforts. However, it is not clear how to quantify a plume. The eye can clearly identify them from the 3D images, although the eye only sees an integrated intensity. On the other hand, planar cross-sections through the flow provide clear identification of these plumes. They indicate for example that the temperature gradient  should play an important role in their identification. Unfortunately, both the temperature and its gradient vary along the plume edge (there are strong and weak plumes). Currently our color maps used by trial and error. Unfortunately, the color maps are not robust; a slight change in the mappings can easily make the plumes disappear, so automatic procedures are clearly required. We have developed a wavelet threshholding approach for plume identification. The color map would be generated based on field values in flow regions where the wavelet coefficients exceed a given threhhold. Unfortunately, the threshhold cannot yet be selected without user intervention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">VELOCITY FIELD</head><p>What is the relationship between the structure of the thermal plumes and that of the velocity field? The temperature field clearly indicates upswelling and downswelling motion between the bottom and top plates, but what is the precise mechanism by which this occurs? The temperature can vary either through thermal conduction, or by convection by the velocity field. Thus it is of some interest to better understand the time-evolution of the velocity field.</p><p>We explore a new use of critical points both as a means of flow representation in a highly compressed form and as a way to provide structural information about the flow. Critical points of the velocity field are intrinsically linked to the nonlinear dynamics of the flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In 3D flows, their structure provides clues regarding whether pathlines intersect planes along continuous curves or chaotic point distributions. In visualization, critical points have been used as a means of simplifying the representation of vector fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Critical points are the points in the flow where the velocity vanishes. The structure of the flow in a neighborhood of a critical point x is easily derived from the linear approximation to the vector field about x. The type of the critical point is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the velocity field evaluated at x is often used to characterize the nature of the flow (rotational, divergent, swirling, etc.). In three-dimensions, the structure of the flow in the neighborhood of a critical point is more difficult to interpret <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>To date, critical points have not been exploited in time-dependent convective flows. The sparsity of critical points in 3-D flows leads us to consider an alternate technique that is meant to visualize the flow from the perspective of symmetry and global complexity. To accomplish this, we compute the critical points of three two-dimensional flow fields uz(x, y) = (u, v), ux(y, z) = (v, w), and uy(z, x) = (w, u). These fields are the 3D velocity restricted to the x − y, x − z and y − z planes. The subscripts x, y, z remind us that these 2-D fields are parameterized by the third dimension. Next, we compute the critical points of uz(x, y) in all x − y slices and assign them a color. We do the same for the critical points in the x − z and y − z slices. Each critical point is displayed as a small cube. We precompute the critical points of the projected velocity fields that correspond to the 300 time slices of the 97 3 data set at Ra = 10 6 . We have found an average of 5000 critical points in each frame. The Ra = 10 6 dataset was chosen because it was cheap to recompute the flow and produce the required datasets. The flows at higher resolution were already computed and the data saved at much coarser time intervals.  The results for the constant and variable conductivity data are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figures 8-9</ref> respectively. The top-left image corresponds to an early stage in the simulation, before the formation of the plumes. In the top-right image, the complexity of the flow has clearly increased, as determined by the number and more apparently random distribution of the critical points. Note, however, that the variable conductivity case maintains some structure for a longer time, consistent with the observations based on volume rendering of the temperature. The bottom-right image is representative of the state of the flow when it is quasi-stationary. We have constructed a module for Amira that can interactively browse through the critical points of all 300 sets data. The animation can be controlled by the software, or the user can interactively scan through the data for the purpose of exploration. Work is in progress to use this tool as a navigation device to zoom in on features of interest or to show alternate flow representations at the times selected by the user.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have applied state-of-the-art visualization tools to some largescale time-dependent mantle convection data sets to better understand the underlying structure of the temperature field, which becomes turbulent beyond a critical Rayleigh number. We have used the notion of critical points to construct a skeletal representation that helps characterize inherent symmetries and complexity in the flow. While volumetric rendering remains a fundamental tool to help understand the geometric structural intricacies of thermal plumes, there remains the task of developing robust algorithms for automatic color map generation and plume extraction. This work is fundamental to research activities Earthscope <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Geometry of mantle convection IEEE Visualization 2002 Oct. 27 -Nov. 1, 2002, Boston, MA, USA 0-7803-7498-3/02/$17.00 © 2002 IEEE</figDesc></figure>
