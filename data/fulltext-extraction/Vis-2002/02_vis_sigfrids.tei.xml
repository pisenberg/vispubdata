				<p>While many methods exist for visualising scalar and vector data, visualisation of tensor data is still troublesome. We present a method for visualising second order tensors in three dimensions using a hybrid between direct volume rendering and glyph rendering. An overview scalar field is created by using three-dimensional adaptive filtering of a scalar field containing noise. The filtering process is controlled by the tensor field to be visualised, creating patterns that characterise the tensor field. By combining direct volume rendering of the scalar field with standard glyph rendering methods for detailed tensor visualisation, a hybrid solution is created. A combined volume and glyph renderer was implemented and tested with both synthetic tensors and strain-rate tensors from the human heart muscle, calculated from phase contrast magnetic resonance image data. A comprehensible result could be obtained, giving both an overview of the tensor field as well as detailed information on individual tensors.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Visualisation of tensor data has become even more important with the ability to acquire tensor metrics. This can be done with, for example, diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> or strain-rate calculation from phase-contrast MRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Add to that the various kinds of simulations that output a tensor field. This paper tries to address some of the problems that arise when visualising symmetric second order tensors in three dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Previous Work</head><p>One common way of visualising tensors is to represent the tensor with an icon or glyph. The glyph can then represent some or all degrees of freedom from the tensor, depending on it's type. When visualising tensor fields with one glyph per tensor, it is difficult to make out continuity, because two adjacent glyphs do not form a continuous shape. This gets even more difficult when a 3D tensor field is studied, where occlusion becomes a problem.</p><p>Methods for visualisation of tensor fields include various generalisations of streamlines to tensor data, such as hyperstreamlines <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Their success is highly dependent on starting points, or seeding points.</p><p>Line integral convolution (LIC), originally a method for visualising vector fields, was introduced by Cabral et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and further improved by Hege et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. It is a powerful method that shows direction (or, rather, tangent) of flow in a vector field. One of the advantages of the LIC algorithm is that it has a high spatial resolution. In contrast to the streamline family, no seeding points are needed; LIC visualises the vector field in every point, more or less. The key to the success of LIC is that it creates a continuous representation. To be able to do that, it assumes that the data itself is continuous, and exploits that fact. Mostly, though, physical data has this property, given sufficient resolution.</p><p>LIC is really designed for vector fields, and not tensor fields. Dickinson <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> suggested that tensors could be visualised as vector fields with the vector being the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. Hsu <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> extended this, suggesting two LIC images to be calculated, one for the largest eigenvalue and one for the next largest eigenvalue, where the image corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue uses a shorter filter length. The images are then added together to form the resulting image. Unfortunately, since the ratio between the eigenvalues is not taken into account, it fails to describe the degree of anisotropy of the tensor field, which is often very useful.</p><p>Related to LIC is spot noise, introduced by van Wijk <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and later enhanced by de Leeuw and van Wijk <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. It can be performed in 3D, but is not adapted to tensor visualisation without modifications.</p><p>Laidlaw et al. introduced brush strokes as an alternative <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This method can convey the degree of anisotropy, but it lacks continuity. Also, it is oriented towards 2D visualisation.</p><p>A volume rendering approach, designed for 3D diffusion tensors, which shares ideas with the work described in this paper, was proposed by Kindlmann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. While being good at visualising diffusion tensors, it is unclear whether it would perform well on strain-rate tensors. It uses a reaction/diffusion method to create a scalar 3D texture, later applied to a shaded surface. This scalar texture has similarities to the scalar overview field we propose, though computed in a different way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head><p>We suggest a hybrid visualisation method, consisting of volume rendering of a scalar field for overview visualisation, retaining continuity, and a glyph rendering for detailed tensor analysis with a much smaller region of interest (ROI), showing all degrees of freedom of the tensors while at the same time avoiding occlusion problems. A 3D cursor is then used to position the ROI where the glyph is rendered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Scalar Overview Visualisation</head><p>For the overview visualisation, the tensor volume is decomposed into a scalar volume, retaining a few, but important, properties of the tensor volume. The scalar volume is created by iterated adaptive filtering of a noise texture, inspired by image enhancement using adaptive filtering, introduced by Knutsson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. The noise field is low pass filtered, thereby smearing the noise spots, and then filtered with directed high-pass filters in directions with weak eigenvalues, to cancel out the smearing, leaving spots smeared in strong eigendirections. The result is then visualised using volume rendering techniques, available in different flavours on different hardware for rapid rendering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Filter Construction</head><p>First, one spherically symmetric low-pass filter, F lp , is constructed. Various kinds of low-pass filters can be used, but we chose a Gaussian low pass filter, defined in the frequency domain as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F lp (ρ) = e − ρ 2 2σ 2 (1)</formula><p>where ρ is the frequency (with 0 &lt; ρ &lt; π) and σ 2 being the variance of the filter, here empirically set to σ 2 = 0.09.</p><p>Then, six spherically separable directional high-pass filters are defined. By standard convention, when u is the frequency, ρ = |u| andû = u |u| . The k-th filter, F k is defined by its radial component, R(ρ), and directional component,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D k (û), respectively F k (u) = R(ρ)D k (û)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The directional part is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">D k (û) = (n k •û) 2<label>(3)</label></formula><p>wheren k is the direction of the filter, defined as the directions of the vertices of an icosahedron:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">  n 1 = c (a, 0, b) Tn 2 = c (−a, 0, b) T n3 = c (b, a, 0) Tn 4 = c (b, −a, 0) T n5 = c (0, b, a) Tn 6 = c (0, b, −a) T (4) with a = 2 b = (1 + √ 5) c = (10 + 2 √ 5) −1/2</formula><p>These six filters, when combined, are enough to create a filter with any direction, being more computationally efficient compared to creating a new filter for every voxel. This is explained by Knutsson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> along with the parameter choices for a, b and c.</p><p>The radial part of the directed high-pass filters are defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">R(ρ) = Fs(ρ) − F lp (ρ)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>with</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Fs(ρ) =    1 0 ≤ ρ &lt; ρ l cos 2 π(ρ−ρ l ) 2(ρ h −ρ l ) ρ l ≤ ρ &lt; ρ h 0 ρ h ≤ ρ<label>(6)</label></formula><p>The Fs is a spherical filter that gives a smooth transition from 1 where ρ &lt; ρ l to 0 where ρ &gt; ρ h to ensure that the high-pass filter does not pass through any frequencies with ρ &gt; ρ h . We have empirically chosen ρ l = 0.7π and ρ h = π.</p><p>These filters are created only once, and reused for each iterative step. Iso-surfaces of the seven filters are plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Tensor Re-mapping</head><p>The tensors are re-mapped to enhance the visual experience. We want to exaggerate the tensor shape to create a more easily recognisable field. If the tensor is closest to being linear (one dominating eigenvalue), we exaggerate it to be even more linear, etc. This is accomplished by re-mapping the eigenvalues and then reconstructing the tensor from the eigenvalues and their respective eigenvectors.</p><p>First, the eigenvalues are scaled so that the largest eigenvalue, λ1, becomes 1. The signs of the eigenvalues are discarded, so the scalar overview visualisation does not convey eigenvalue sign. The scaling discards the original norm of the tensors as well. Both of these are visualised using glyph rendering.</p><p>Then, the eigenvalues are mapped through the function</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">µ(x; α, β) = (|x|(1 − α)) β (|x|(1 − α)) β + (α(1 − |x|)) β (7)</formula><p>which is plotted in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The parameters α and β control the shape of the re-mapping function. α is the x where µ crosses 0.5 and β controls the "sharpness" of the function. Higher β means a steeper curve, closer to a step function, lower β gives a function closer to the identity function. We use α = 0.5 and β = 2.</p><p>The adaptive filtering described by Knutsson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> is designed for orientation tensors, and will therefore smear across strong eigenvectors instead of along them. Therefore, we re-map the eigenvalues once more so that large eigenvalues become small, and small eigenvalues become large, using the mapping function</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">ν(x; α, β) = 2 1 + µ(x; α, β) − 1 (8)</formula><p>which is in turn plotted in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">Iterative Filtering</head><p>The noise input field, which is a standard Gaussian noise field with a variance of 1, is filtered by multiplication with the filters in the Fourier domain, creating seven filter responses; one low-pass and  </p><formula xml:id="formula_8">s = s lp + k c k s k (9)</formula><p>where s lp is low-pass filter response and s k is the filter response from the high-pass filter F k .</p><p>The coefficients, c k , are computed for each point as the product sum scalar tensor product</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">c k = C • M k<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where C is the tensor at that point and M k are the filterassociated dual tensors, defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">M k = αn kn T k − βI<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where I is the 3 by 3 identity matrix, α = 5 4 and β = 1 4 in the three-dimensional case, as described by Knutsson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. The c k are calculated only once and reused for every iteration.</p><p>To clarify the algorithm, a two-dimensional example iteration sequence is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. Since the seven filterings are independent, they were performed in parallel with good speedup using seven processors. Also, most of the filtering time is spent in the Fourier transforms. Since the multidimensional Fourier transforms are separable, they can too be parallelised, if enough processors are available.</p><p>With large volumes, the memory requirements for the filters and their respective responses are large. Memory requirements were cut in half by exploiting the fact that the filters are real and even in the Fourier domain and the noise field is real in the signal domain. The noise is therefore complex Hermitian in the Fourier domain. Consequently the filter responses are also complex Hermitian in the Fourier domain and thus real in the signal domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4">Eigenvalue Distribution Colour Coding</head><p>The scalar field obtained from the adaptive filtering can be further enhanced by adding colours. One way of adding colour is to encode the eigenvalue distribution, thus showing the degree of anisotropy of the tensor field. This is done with</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">R = λ1 − λ2 λ1 (12) G = λ2 − λ3 λ1 (13) B = λ3 λ1<label>(14)</label></formula><p>R, G and B are the components of red, green and blue, respectively. λi are absolute values of the eigenvalues, sorted so that λ1 is the largest. This gives the following properties for R, G and B:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">0 &lt; R &lt; 1 (15) 0 &lt; G &lt; 1 (16) 0 &lt; B &lt; 1 (17) R + G + B = 1 (18)</formula><p>The R, G and B components then show the "probability" for the tensor being linear, planar or isotropic, respectively. This does not really add more information to the visualisation process, but it helps classification of the tensor. Furthermore, it aids depth perception when combined with interaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Glyph Tensor Visualisation</head><p>The most common way of visualising all degrees of freedom of a tensor is to use glyph rendering. One tensor is represented with a geometric object that can visualise all properties of the tensor.</p><p>Most glyph-based tensor field visualisation techniques show a glyph for every tensor in the field. In contrast to this, we suggest displaying only one or a few tensors, selected by interaction with a 3D cursor. Since we also provide an overview visualisation, not every tensor needs to be displayed with a glyph.</p><p>There are several different glyphs to consider, and some of them have certain constraints on the tensors to visualise, regarding, for instance, symmetry or sign of eigenvalues. The method suggested in this paper is invariant of the tensor glyph chosen.</p><p>For symmetric, real, positive semidefinite tensors (all eigenvalues are positive), ellipsoids provide an easy glyph. Let the eigenvectors be the principal axes and the eigenvalues be the radii of the ellipsoid. The different cases (linear, planar and isotropic) will be represented with appropriate shapes, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>.</p><p>Ellipsoids can also be drawn with wire-frame rendering, that is, only draw the edges of the polygons without filling the surface. This has the advantage of not obscuring the scalar volume when doing hybrid rendering. On the other hand, one has to sacrifice shading when drawing in wire-frame mode.</p><p>An alternative to ellipsoids is to use a line-based glyph. The tensor is simply represented with lines in the eigenvector directions with the length being proportional to the magnitude of the eigenvalue. The sign of the eigenvalue controls the colour of the line; a red line for positive eigenvalues and a blue line for negative eigenvalues. Sometimes, though, the line-based glyph can be hard to spot among the structure of the scalar overview field. Examples of line-based glyphs are also shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Combining Scalar Volume Rendering with Glyphs</head><p>Combining scalar volume rendering and glyph rendering imposes a problem; to display both glyphs and volume rendering at the same time. We solved this by using an OpenGL texture based volume renderer with a depth buffer and opaque glyphs. The opaque surfaces are first drawn in an arbitrary order, updating the depth buffer at every pixel. Then, the semi-transparent volume slices are drawn in a back-to-front order. This was implemented using both 2D or 3D textures in mono and stereo on a variety of platforms, ranging from consumer to high end hardware.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Obtaining Strain-Rate Tensors</head><p>One application for tensor visualisation is investigating the strainrate (rate of deformation) in the heart musculature to study cardiac dysfunction and also to help understand the mechanics and physiology of the heart. We calculate the strain-rate tensors from phasecontrast MRI by first computing the velocity Jacobian J according to </p><formula xml:id="formula_13">J =    ∂u</formula><p>where (x y z) T is the coordinate vector and (u v w) T is the velocity vector, obtained using 3D phase-contrast MRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</p><p>The rigid body rotation should not contribute to the deformation rate, so only the symmetric part needs to be considered. Thus, to obtain a strain-rate tensor T, J is forced symmetric by</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">T = 1 2 J + J T<label>(20)</label></formula><p>The velocity data used for strain-rate tensor calculation was acquired with sampling distances of 4 by 4 by 1.2 mm. At this resolution, the strain-rate tensor is not particularly continuous. The adaptive filter technique depends on highly continuous data with low frequency to perform adequately. To get that kind of data, it was low-pass filtered, reducing the accuracy of the tensors, and resampled to a higher resolution (0.375 mm in all three directions) using cubic interpolation. Only the tensor field used to create the scalar field is low-pass filtered; for glyph rendering, the original tensor field is used.</p><p>When performing low-pass filtering, or smoothing, one must be careful not to blend tensors from inside the myocardium (heart muscle) with tensors from blood inside the heart or the lungs outside. This is solved using normalised averaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, with a myocardial probability as the certainty function. We use a method suggested by Ebbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, which finds a probability function for tissue from time-resolved 3D phase contrast MRI data, by discarding voxels that have a high probability of being air or blood. After the normalised averaging, the data inside the myocardium is smooth and not contaminated with data from outside. The border, however, contains tensors that change rapidly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>A combined volume and glyph renderer using OpenGL was implemented on a variety of platforms, using both 2D and 3D textures, in stereo where available. Where texture mapping was hardware accelerated, interactive frame rates (greater than 15 fps, depending on screen size) were obtained. It was found that stereo rendering and the interactivity improved the depth perception significantly. The images presented below were created using 3D textures on a SGI Onyx2 InfiniteReality running IRIX 6.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Synthetic Tensor Data</head><p>The renderer was tested on three synthetic tensor volumes. The visualisation of the volumes are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figures 6a and 6b</ref> show a field where all tensors are linear (one dominating eigenvalue). The eigenvalues were set as λ1 = 1, λ2 = λ3 = 0.1. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6a</ref>, the direction of the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue is radial, whereas it is cylindrical in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6b</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6c</ref> shows a field where all tensors are planar (two dominating eigenvalues). The eigenvalues were set as λ1 = λ2 = 1, λ3 = 0.1. The direction of the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue is radial. Note that this direction corresponds to the normal of the scalar field surface structure.</p><p>The synthetic volumes are 64 3 in size and the adaptive filtering was iterated 20 times.</p><p>The images from synthetic tensor data do not use eigenvalue colour coding, so they are in gray scale, and have been inverted for printing purposes. Note especially that the glyph resembles the local structure of the scalar field. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Human Strain-Rate Tensor Data</head><p>The method was also tested on strain-rate data from the heart of a healthy human volunteer. The volume was cut to only include the left ventricle and re-sampled to 256 3 in size. The scalar field was generated by 40 iterations of adaptive filtering and retrospectively masked so that only the tissue, as found using a threshold of a tissue probability function suggested by Ebbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, remained. The filtering time on a Sun Fire-6800 with 8 UltraSPARC-III CPUs of 900 MHz each was 10 minutes and 20 seconds. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref> shows the scene, without the glyph rendering and with high opacity to aid general orientation in the images. The apex (tip), base, left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV) of the heart are marked. The cut plane is arranged in a short-axis manner. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows a short-axis slab of the scalar data. The glyph is located in the left heart wall and the volume is viewed from two locations, to better convey the depth of the field. In <ref type="figure">Figure 8a</ref>, the heart wall of the left ventricle can clearly be seen (like a ring) and the tensor glyph is clearly planar, also shown with the green colour in the scalar field. In <ref type="figure">Figure 8b</ref>, the heart wall ring is seen from the side, showing the orientation of the planar glyph. Note that the shape of the scalar field in the neighbourhood of the glyph is shown as a planar green structure. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows a long-axis slab, orthogonal to a short-axis slab. The left ventricle is shown from the side. Near and above the apex (tip), the chest can be seen. The glyph is located in the apex of the heart, and shown from two angles. Also here, the tensor is planar, conveyed by the glyph, the colour and the local structure of the scalar field.  <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>: Myocardial strain-rate data, short-axis slab.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>We have presented a method for visualising second order tensor fields in three dimensions. The method combines adaptive filtered noise field for overview visualisation with standard glyph rendering for detail visualisation. The scalar field was visualised using a hybrid volume renderer, rendering both a semi-transparent scalar overview volume using 2D or 3D textures and the glyphs for detail visualisation using standard polygon and line geometry. Many tensor visualisation techniques that are generalised from two-dimensional to three-dimensional have a problem with occlusion and the problem of continuity becomes even harder. Visualisation techniques generalised from vector to tensor fields usually have problems representing the degree of anisotropy of the tensor field.</p><p>The main advantage of this method is that it gives an accurate detail visualisation while still providing continuity, something that is lacking in most other techniques.</p><p>In the case of tensor imaging of the heart wall, it was possible to make the voxels not belonging to the heart wall totally transparent, using the tissue probability function suggested by Ebbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. However, this is not generally possible for tensor imaging in other domains. Therefore, it should be investigated how to make parts of the volume (semi-)transparent. This could be done by reducing opacity in areas depending on anisotropy, for example, in isotropic areas, if that is of less interest. Another possibility is to control the opacity according to the variation of the tensor field, thus reducing the opacity in areas with low or high variation in the tensor field.</p><p>This method emphasises a lot on visualising the anisotropy of the tensor field, as opposed to visualising the magnitude. This might not always be desirable. The colour coding step of the method could be changed to show the magnitude of the tensor, instead of redundantly showing the degree of anisotropy. Perhaps a hue/intensity combination could show both. The tensor norm can also be used to modulate the opacity of the field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Strain-Rate Adaption</head><p>The method described in this paper is aimed to visualise general symmetric second order tensors. For simplicity, the scalar field is generated without regard to the sign of the eigenvalues. It is application dependent whether this is a big disadvantage or not. For strain-rate tensors, the scalar overview is adequate, because it is just used as an overview, and the glyph rendering displays the sign of the eigenvalues.</p><p>The result could be improved further if strain-rate tensors are assumed. Strain-rate tensors are in a way a general symmetric second order tensor, and would mathematically encompass also positive semidefinite tensors, such as diffusion tensors. Taking the underlying physics into account, strain-rate tensors and diffusion tensors are quite different and, hence, ought to be visualised differently. Preferably, the visualisation of the tensors would mimic the underlying physics.</p><p>The sign of the eigenvalues can be added to the scalar field, if the eigenvalue re-mapping function is altered. This re-mapping could be done with a simple sigmoid, approaching 1 for large negative eigenvalues and 0 for large positive eigenvalues. This would cause areas with large positive eigenvalues to only have low pass content (large noise spheres, planes or lines) and areas with large negative eigenvalues to be high-pass filtered (small noise spheres, planes or lines). Eigenvalues close to zero would be re-mapped to 0.5, being somewhere in between. The resulting scalar field would then be as if the original noise function was medium size spheres, compressed or expanded in the directions of negative or positive eigenvalues, respectively.</p><p>Ellipsoid type glyphs can also be made to show the sign of the eigenvalues. Kirby et al. deformed unit circles according to the local strain-rate tensor in 2D <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The circle was expanded in directions of positive eigenvalues and compressed in directions of negative eigenvalues. Eigenvalues of zero neither compressed nor expanded the circle. When generalising this to 3D and only a single glyph, one needs to add a reference sphere, to show both the original unit sphere and the deformed ellipsoid to be able to see what is compression and what is expansion. With multiple glyphs in 2D this is not needed nor possible, because the deformed ellipses can be compared to each other and adding a reference circle to every ellipse would clutter the view. The amount of compression or expansion should be controlled by the magnitude of the eigenvalue, but how this should be done is not obvious. Kirby uses an exponential function to map eigenvalue to radius.</p><p>Preliminary tests of combining the strain-rate adapted scalar field with the reference/deformed sphere type glyph show promising results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper presented a method for visualising second order tensor fields in three dimensions, using an adaptive filtered noise field for overview visualisation combined with standard glyph rendering for detail visualisation. The glyph and scalar field was shown to be congruent, meaning that the overview scalar field can be used to show some properties of the tensor. The scalar field was also shown to visualise both direction and degree of anisotropy.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Iso-surface plots of the seven filters in the Fourier domain.
