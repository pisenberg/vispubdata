				<p>Visualization is required for the effective utilization of data from a weather simulation. Appropriate mapping of user goals to the design of pictorial content has been useful in the development of interactive applications with sufficient bandwidth for timely access to the model data. When remote access to the model visualizations is required the limited bandwidth becomes the primary bottleneck. To help address these problems, visualizations are presented on a web page as a meta-representation of the model output and serve as an index to simplify finding other visualizations of relevance. To provide consistency with extant interactive products and to leverage their cost of development, the aforementioned applications are adapted to automatically populate a web site with images and interactions for an operational weather forecasting system.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Visualization is required for the effective analysis and assessment of data generated by numerical weather prediction. In that regard, our previous work has discussed methods of appropriate mapping of user goals to the design of pictorial content by considering both the underlying data characteristics and the (human) perception of the visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>. These have been effective in the development of interactive applications utilizing either workstation or PC-game-class three-dimensional graphics systems with sufficient bandwidth for timely access to the model data. When remote access to the visualizations is required the limited bandwidth becomes the primary bottleneck.</p><p>Popular approaches to web-based dissemination of weather forecasting data are problematic as they impose enough compromises in time for access, display fidelity or interactivity to minimize effectiveness. Some utilize a standard workstationbased application with raw data in a compressed fashion to enable faster transmission (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>). But such data reduction eliminates critical information from weather models operating at cloud-scale resolution. Others utilize web browsers by providing static images or flip-book animations, often presented via Javascript-based players or browser plug-ins (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>). Two additional problems are raised by this approach when used alone. The first is the need to heavily sample the images to reduce their size and number to be downloaded. This creates a gross mismatch to the time step used in the simulation, resulting in available images that miss important results. The second is the tendency to provide visualizations of most of the variables derived from the model. This can create a situation where users may have difficulty finding images of relevance. In addition, many of these visualizations may never be used. In some cases, the latter problem has been partially addressed by enabling products to be generated on demand, which has not been considered herein. In this effort, it has been assumed that there are a large number of clients using a relatively limited web server. Hence, the focus is on richer static content that is regularly refreshed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Methods of Disseminating Visualizations</head><p>To summarize some potential methods, consider <ref type="table">Table I</ref>. Each row corresponds to a different mechanism to provide visualizations on the web. All of the environments shown except the first utilize a reduction in quality. The goal for each is to present an "interactive" visualization of three-dimensional time-varying data. To put this table in context, consider the problem of disseminating visual browse products, where the data per time step is relatively modest with sequences of a few hundred time steps <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>. Each approach delivers source material for interaction via different content. The top row is for a traditional interaction using OpenGL hardware acceleration. While high fidelity is inherent in the visualization, a fast network is required.</p><p>Typical realizations are composed of several polygonal surfaces, which are generated independently and combined at render time, but may result in a few hundred thousand triangles --too large to download. To address this problem, each individual component is separately simplified to reduce the bulk by an order of magnitude for storage as VRML (second row). Another approach is available within MPEG-4 utilizing geometric compression to achieve roughly similar reduction. In both cases, it is insufficient for hundreds of time steps.</p><p>An alternative is through image-based rendering (IBR) represented by the third row. At a cost of less three-dimensional flexibility, the expense per time step is reduced by another order of magnitude. Some of that flexibility can be regained through hybrid image and geometry rendering and scaled to larger data per time step. However, the reduction in size is still insufficient.</p><p>The fourth and fifth rows represent a more traditional method of delivering sequences as bitmaps. The former is via flip-book animation, where each image frame is independently lossy compressed. Although image quality can be high, the cost per frame is also high. The fifth row implies a compressed video or animation stream that utilizes interframe similarity to reduce overall volume (e.g., MPEG-1). At resolutions sufficiently high to capture the detail in this type of visualization, the cost for a sequence at best is acceptable. Both of these cases come with a significant trade-off, no three-dimensional interactivity. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">APPROACH AND RESULTS</head><p>The resolution of the visualization must match that of the scale of the model to build usable products that are preceptually and scientifically coherent <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>. The choice of realization geometry is also affected by the resolution of the data so that perceptual artifacts do not dominate the presentation, especially in animation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. Web-based dissemination exacerbates this situation. Therefore, abstraction and compression are introduced to capture sufficient content and reduce underlying bulk, respectively, while utilizing the methods outlined in <ref type="table">Table I</ref>. First, a set of visualizations are presented as an interactive, threedimensional spreadsheet, although such a paradigm is not new. Previously, it has been utilized for general visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, images <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and three-dimensional interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>[6] primarily to support data analysis by facilitating the comparison of different data sets or members of model ensembles. Instead, consider the spreadsheet as an abstraction of a model run. Thus, the rows and columns are organized at a high level (e.g., meteorological characteristics vs. model features) to simplify finding relevant visualizations. An example from an operational web site is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. These visualizations then become a metarepresentation of the model output and serve as an index for more visualizations and interactions.</p><p>This concept is applied to a customized version of the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. Currently, two 24hour forecasts are produced each day on a 3-way nested configuration of 62x62x31 at 16, 4 and 1 km resolution focused on New York City. This complete system has been dubbed "Deep Thunder". (See http://www.research.ibm.com/weather/NY)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Browse Products</head><p>Each statically-defined cell in the spreadsheet shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> contains a three-dimensional scene generated from one time step of the model output. Since the focus is on a high-level representation, the visualizations are designed to be qualitative for browsing (Class III from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>). The left column focuses on atmospheric motion and dynamics by illustrating surface temperature and winds. Each image contains a shaded terrain surface that is colored by contour bands of temperature ( o F.). The terrain is overlaid with maps of coastlines, county and state boundaries and rivers. Individual landmarks and cities are shown by name with the predicted temperature for that time step. The map is also overlaid with arrows for forecasted winds indicating speed by color and direction by orientation.</p><p>The right column focuses on moisture by showing precipitation at the surface and cloud properties. Each image contains a terrain map in a three-dimensional scene with predicted clouds. The clouds are shown as a translucent white isosurface derived from a threshold of total cloud water density of 10 -4 kg water/kg air. If the model predicts severe weather, such as convective activity that could lead to the formation of thunderstorms, then a translucent cyan surface of predicted reflectivities may be visible within the clouds. The region within this surface corresponds to where precipitation is forming. The local terrain is a shaded surface that is colored by contour bands of total precipitation (as rain in inches), following the scale to the upper right, where brown implies no rain (dry) and heavier rainfall is in darker shades of blue. If the model predicts no precipitation then a similar visualization of humidity will be shown instead. If areas where precipitation is forecasted are sufficiently cold, then they may be marked to indicate snow.</p><p>Each cell also supports limited interaction. Via the mouse, one can appear to navigate inside the presented scene by changing a pseudo-camera view. This effect is provided via a Java applet which presents one of nine distinct images with a fixed angular separation (10 o in this case) depending upon the mouse position. The result is context for the product in order to facilitate the selection of alternative visualizations. Currently, only two choices are available. One is to examine a similar visualization, but with images of higher-resolution and greater fidelity.</p><p>The other choice addresses the time-sampling problem. It provides an animation with frames every 10 minutes of forecast time presented as an MPEG-1-compressed video sequence viewable on a web page via a Java-based player or through a plugin. To preserve the fidelity of the animation and to keep the size to only a few MB, source animations are generated at 720p resolution and then interpolated to one-fourth the number of pixels prior to MPEG encoding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Analysis Products</head><p>The ideas used for browse products have been applied in a limited fashion to the generation of images oriented toward analysis. The first case is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> as single column with an aviation product (Class IV from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>). The three images correspond to the three modelling nests, from top to bottom, respectively. They are interactive like each cell of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>Each image contains a brown, translucent, three-dimensional surface shown in vertical pressure coordinates, which corresponds to a boundary where the derived visibility is 10 km. This visibility is based upon extinction properties of cloud water, ice and precipitation, which is determined from the modelled upper air. Thus, the volume inside the surface represents relatively clear air, that is, visibility over 10 km. If no surface is visible then there are no clouds predicted at that time step, and thus, the visibility is high. At the bottom of the scene is a set of colored contours, typically in increments of 2 km, corresponding to the height of the forecasted cloud base. Areas in gray imply no cloud data. The cloud base contours are overlaid with maps of coastline and state boundaries and rivers. The volume is marked at the locations of major airports with set of poles color contoured by the derived visibility. At each of 21 pressure levels, the horizontal wind is shown via arrows, colored and sized by speed. The only other visualization available is an animation as a set of individual JPEG images presented with a Javascript player. This more traditional approach is utilized given that there is one hour of forecast time between each frame, and greater temporal resolution is available in the browse product animations to aid in feature identification. The second case is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> as single column with a product oriented toward atmospheric stability, especially for indicating the potential for severe weather (Class II from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>). Only one of three interactive images corresponding to the nests is shown. A colored surface is presented, where the color corresponds to K Index, following the top legend. The surface is deformed linearly by Lifted Index and overlaid with a set of contour lines of forecasted vertical wind speed using the second color legend. Significant updrafts (green to yellow contours) in blue "valleys" on the surface would imply regions of convective activity. The surface is also overlaid with maps of coastline and state boundaries and rivers. As with the previous example, the only other visualization available is an hourly animation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">IMPLEMENTATION</head><p>The data processing, realization and rendering required to populate the web pages discussed herein have been implemented with Data Explorer (DX) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. DX is a portable, open source, general-purpose software package for visualization and analysis (http:// www.research.ibm.com/dx and http://www.opendx.org). A generic toolkit was used to avoid having to implement a graphics and computational infrastructure. DX is built upon an unified data model that enables these applications to operate directly on the native gridded weather data without transformation or compression. Ordinarily, DX is used as an application enabler to implement interactive systems. DX is based upon a client-server architecture, where the client is the user interface and the (parallelized) server does the computation. Here, the client is used to develop a particular visualization, which yields a program in a high-level language that the server interprets and executes as a directed acyclic graph. Once the program is defined, it can be executed by the server independently of the user interface. The user interface portion for each of the applications (as outlined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>) parameterizes model runs of interest, variables to be processed, techniques to be utilized, style of output to be generated, etc. These parameters then become the specification of a higher-level language for the execution of the program. The result is then a compact representation of a complex visualization that can be executed in a production fashion, and easily extended. Multiple instances of these graphs with differing inputs are then used to generate individual products. The output from each is one or more high quality images. The images are post-processed employing tools from the open source ImageMagick suite (http://www.imagemagick.org) in order to provide material suitable for presentation in a web browser.</p><p>All of the DX and ImageMagick-based processing is embedded in a set of hierarchical scripts, which are invoked automatically after the completion of each model run. That work is illustrated schematically in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. This processing is parallelized for the same parallel system (seven 4-way SMP nodes) that is used for the model execution, but is also supplemented with additional SMP workstations as part of a larger cluster, shown as blue hexagons.</p><p>The processing consists of two major parts --generation of browse and analysis products (yellow rectangles). In both cases, summary statistics are generated, which are used to enable scaling for the full dynamic range and to adapt the content depending on model results. Then the work to create individual products (i.e., JPEG or MPEG files) is split up among the available nodes to run simultaneously. This simple parallelism enables the population of each browse spreadsheet and available products to be completed in under 15 minutes. The html for the target web pages is written as templates. Hence, the files from each model run replace those derived from the previous one. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">UTILIZATION</head><p>These capabilities are used to disseminate results of at least twice daily model-based 24-hour weather predictions via a web site. They are supplemented with additional types of customized visualizations as well as simple line plots of weather variables as a function of forecast time.</p><p>The users range from non-specialists with casual interest for precision forecasts to individuals focused on decision support and planning in transportation, energy and emergency management applications, some of whom are meteorologists. Their diverse needs and successful utilization via a small web server has shown the viability of this approach. However, their feedback has indicated the need for further development. In particular, the spreadsheet established interest in the techniques, but it was insufficient for analysis tasks due to the lack of query or transformation capabilities. This suggests three types of enhancement. The first is to incorporate additional, even very simple, products that could be selected from each cell. The next would be more rows and columns to compensate for the lack of further choices. Finally, the need to have greater interactivity beyond the geometric quick-look technique, which could be provided within the cell or as a selection for each cell. Development of additional visualization content continues to follow the principles of task-specific design to improve effectiveness while minimizing development cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>This approach to web-based visualization has shown promise in an operational environment. The spreadsheet/abstraction notion can be further expanded to serve as an index for more traditional webbased visualizations as well as visualizations that can be developed on technologies becoming available to support entertainment and e-business applications (e.g., MPEG-4). In addition, the spreadsheet itself can be enhanced to incorporate other results.</p><p>Another interaction currently under development is applied to the data-sampling problem. It employs a specialized "extreme" level of compression based upon task-specific abstractions of underlying components of a visualization scene composed of several simpler geometric forms that are used multiple times such as in the browse products shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. They each can be represented by higher-order focused descriptions of the geometry. Hence, renderings of geometry are distributed instead of geometry itself. A typical Mpixel image of this type can be adequately described with only a few KB of data. Thus, animation sequences of a few hundred frames become very inexpensive to store and transmit (i.e., one order of magnitude smaller than MPEG and two orders of magnitude for JPEG sequences). Since the description is geometric, it also provides the potential for limited direct manipulation like the aforementioned spreadsheet cells but unlike a pure animation sequence.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Web-Based 3d Image Spreadsheet for Browse Products.</figDesc></figure>
