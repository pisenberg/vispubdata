				<p>The bioactivity of a molecule strongly depends on its metastable conformational shapes and the transitions between these. Therefore, conformation analysis and visualization is a basic prerequisite for the understanding of biochemical processes. We present techniques for visual analysis of metastable molecular conformations. Core of these are flexibly applicable methods for alignment of molecular geometries, as well as methods for depicting shape and &apos;fuzziness&apos; of metastable conformations. All analysis tools are provided in an integrated working environment. The described techniques are demonstrated with pharmaceutically active biomolecules.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The central goal of molecular biology is to elucidate the relationship between sequence, structure, properties and function of biomolecules. Such knowledge allows one to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying biological or pharmaceutical processes. Furthermore, it enables one to identify drug candidates and optimize these. The two major steps in drug discovery are finding a chemical compound which shows a desired bioactivity and then modifying this drug candidate to build in all desirable properties.</p><p>Many biological functions are regulated by the docking of small molecules (called ligands) with sites on large molecules such as proteins (called receptors). In a typical scenario a big and complex enzyme is given that takes part in some pathological biochemical process, where some ligand docks to an active region of the receptor and, catalyzed by the enzyme, some reaction takes place. As this process is pathological for the surrounding organism, the aim of drug design is to find some means to suppress the reaction. This could be achieved by exposing the enzyme to an inhibitor, which is a molecule that can also dock to the enzyme's active site and thereby occupies it before the regular substrate of the pathological reaction can dock. Beta-blockers for instance mimic natural small molecules such as adrenaline and thereby block their binding, thus stopping overstimulation of heart muscles.</p><p>The effectiveness of drugs therefore depends on their shape and charge distribution. However, molecules are not static structures. They move, vibrate, and interact with other molecules and their environment. Understanding these movements and interactions is essential for the complete understanding of structure-function relationships, including many aspects of drug design and intermolecular interactions. The shapes of a molecule have to be understood as metastable conformations, i.e. areas in the high-dimensional coordinate space that the system stays in for a long time. In order to understand the bioactivity of a molecule, its different conformations and their probabilities of occurrence have to be considered. Regarding drug design, for instance, it may be that one conformation does not fit into the active site, while another one fits perfectly. Even more, a biochemical function may be the result of a conformational change.</p><p>The computational identification of molecular conformations is a difficult task, but it is possible now for small and medium-sized molecules. This analysis yields approximations of metastable conformations in form of finite sets of corresponding molecular geometries.</p><p>Our central aim is to visualize metastable conformations in such a way that one is able to understand the differences between the various shapes a molecule may adopt. Furthermore, we are interested in depicting the fuzziness of these shapes, i.e. the locally differing amounts of flexibility and rigidity. In this paper we present methods</p></div>

Section 2 surveys related work. The physical background and a concise definition of molecular conformations are presented in Section 3. Section 4 covers our approach to the visualization of metastable molecular conformations. In particular we describe the alignment of individual molecular geometries and of sets of geometries in Section 4.1. Section 4.2 addresses the selection of typical representatives of conformations. In Section 4.3 we describe in detail how the above mentioned probability density can be efficiently computed and visualized. In Section 5 we present application examples using three different molecules. Conclusions and future work are presented in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Molecular visualization is a well established technique, widely used in research and industry. The multi-faceted needs in chemical, biochemical and pharmaceutical analyses have been addressed by several commercial and academic software packages. Most of these  offer wireframe, surface-and volume-based representations of various types of molecular data, as well as editing functions.</p><p>Alignment is a classical task in molecular science. When two molecules are to be compared based on Cartesian atom coordinates, alignment is necessary to eliminate differences caused by global rigid transformations. Kabsch <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> gives a straight forward method to compute an alignment between two point sets. Pennec <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> develops an approach to align multiple point sets iteratively. Both methods are characterized in more detail in Section 4.1.</p><p>Huitema and van Liere <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> describe techniques for interactive visualization of protein dynamics, utilizing the concept of essential dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. They interpret the dynamics of a protein as a trajectory in a high dimensional space and employ covariance analysis to filter out large concerted motions.</p><p>Pang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> developed various techniques for presenting data together with uncertainty and presented a classification of the possibilities of uncertainty visualization. Djurcilov et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> proposed two methods for incorporating volumetric uncertainty information in direct volume rendering. Techniques for visualizing molecules with positional uncertainty are discussed by Rheingans and Joshi <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. They developed a likelihood volume representation where for a given set of molecules a Gaussian splat is drawn for each atom of each molecule. The resultant scalar field is depicted either by iso-surfacing or by direct volume rendering.</p><p>Regarding uncertainty visualization we extend their work by admitting in the probability accumulation step also (cylindrical) molecular bonds. Furthermore, we design an algorithm for efficiently computing the probability density, such that large sets of molecular geometries can be processed at reasonable speed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METASTABLE CONFORMATIONS</head><p>This section sketches the data generation and classifying process, i.e. how representative geometries are created for a given molecule and how individual geometries are classified into metastable conformations.</p><p>The reader not interested in this background may skip this section, having in mind that the molecular dynamics simulation produces molecular geometries qi (i = 1, ..., Mtot), which are classified into disjoint sets Cj (j = 1, ..., n), each set Cj representing a metastable conformation of the molecule.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Molecules as Dynamical Systems</head><p>Molecules are not static, but are in persistent motion. They have to be considered as dynamical systems that are fast fluctuating and changing. Although molecules consist of atoms and chemical bonds, i.e. entities which are intrinsically quantum mechanical, many essential molecular properties can be understood on a classical level. Quantum mechanics enters only via (classical) potentials that account for quantum effects in some global way. In the classical description a molecule's microscopic state, consisting of N atoms at some instant of time, is defined as a point x = (q, p) in phase space Γ ⊂ R 2d where q and p denote the classical positions and momenta of all N atoms respectively. The energy of the molecule depends on these d = 3N spatial coordinates q and momenta p and is given by the Hamiltonian</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H(q, p) = 1 2 p T M −1 p + V (q)</formula><p>where M is the diagonal mass matrix and V a differentiable potential.</p><p>If no energy is fed in or taken away, the dynamical system moves through the high dimensional phase space Γ with fixed energy E, i.e. on iso-levels H(p, q) = E of the multi-minima function H(p, q). The corresponding canonical equations of motionq = M −1 p,ṗ = − grad V (q) describe the dynamics of the molecule. The trajectory in phase space with initial state x0 = (q(0), p(0)) is given by x(t) = (q(t), p(t)) = Φ t x0 where Φ t denotes the flow.</p><p>For a given microscopic state x ∈ Γ we use the projections q = πqx and p = πpx to extract the position and momentum information from x. We call q the molecular geometry and the set Ω = πqΓ ⊂ R d position space.</p><p>In classical molecular physics, the interaction potential V of a molecular system is modeled as a sum of contributions from different interactions. These include local interactions that induce vibrations of covalent or hydrogen bonds, bond angles and dihedral angles, as well as long-range interactions, like electrostatic and van der Waals interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Statistical Ensembles, Sampling</head><p>Due to principle measurement uncertainties, we never know the precise state of a single molecule. Furthermore, in practical applications we are usually considering large sets of molecules. Therefore, we have to simulate an ensemble of molecular systems starting with some initial distribution f (x) of states in phase space Γ which is compatible with the physical situation considered. As we consider only equilibrium systems, the density f is stationary. In nature, molecular systems typically are not isolated, but interact thermally with their environment. Such an ensemble therefore contains molecules with different energies H(p, q). Molecular systems with constant temperature T , particle number and volume are described by the canonical density</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">fcan(x) = 1 Z e −βH(x) , with Z = Γ e −βH(x) dx<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where β = 1/kT with k being Boltzmann's constant. For generation of representative molecular geometries this high dimensional probability distribution in phase space Γ has to be sampled. A standard technique is Hybrid Monte Carlo, where short time trajectories are computed (by numerically integrating the canonical equations of motion) and Monte Carlo steps are interspersed. Each Monte Carlo step creates a new initial state xi = (qi, pi) for the next trajectory on base of the endpoint of the previous trajectory, guaranteeing that the states xi (i = 1, ..., Mtot) are distributed according to the density fcan. The Hybrid Monte Carlo technique employed for generation of the molecular configurations used in this paper is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Conformation Analysis</head><p>The phrase 'metastable conformation' indicates a dynamic aspect of molecular behavior: it denotes metastable shapes, i.e. molecular geometries which survive the fast oscillations around equilibrium positions, this means configurations whose trajectory remains inside a set for a long time period before leaving it eventually. In mathematical terms a conformation therefore is an almost invariant set of the ensemble. Let us denote by w(A, B, τ ) the probability for a transition within time span τ from a subset A of the phase space to another one, B. Then the subset A is called invariant under the flow Φ τ iff, for all t ∈ R, Φ t (A) = A and thus w(A, A, t) = 1; it is called almost invariant, if w(A, A, t) ≈ 1.</p><p>Conformations are typically hierarchically organized, due to the multi-scale structure of the energy landscape. The aim of computational conformation analysis therefore is a classification task: find the hierarchy of almost invariant sets Cj, each representing a metastable conformation of the molecule, and classify the molecular geometries qi into these sets. To accomplish that, a novel approach on the basis of a transfer operator has been employed; for details see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">VISUALIZATION OF MOLECULAR CONFOR-MATIONS</head><p>In the following section we will describe techniques for the visualization of molecular metastable conformations. Before we go into detail, we want to give an overview of the relations between the different parts (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>).</p><p>Our starting point is a metastable conformation, approximated by a finite set of molecular geometries qi (i = 1, ..., M ). All visualization methods to be applied require a precursory alignment. This in turn depends on the decision which atoms of the molecule should be considered for alignment (cf. Section 4.1).</p><p>After computation of the alignment, two approaches are available. The first is to identify a single geometry that can be considered as a representative and to depict it using standard molecular visualization techniques (cf. Section 4.2). While a representative reduces the conformation to only one plain molecular shape, the second approach aims at focussing on the geometric variability of the metastable conformation (cf. Section 4.3). For this we compute a scalar density function, namely the probability of the molecule's geometric representation to occupy some point in 3D space. This density can be visualized using direct volume rendering or isosurfaces.</p><p>After using these techniques with a standard alignment considering all atoms of the molecule, the user can feed back gained insights by choosing a more suitable subset of atoms to be aligned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Alignment</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Cartesian Versus Internal Coordinates</head><p>A crucial difficulty of conformation visualization lies in the conversion between relative and absolute coordinates. A single molecular geometry is specified by three-component Cartesian coordinate vectors a j for each atom j. To facilitate notation, we represent a molecular geometry qi by a 'geometry vector' Gi, consisting of an N -tuple of 3D coordinate vectors</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Gi = (a 1 i , a 2 i , ..., a N i ),</formula><p>where N is the number of atoms in the molecule. These geometries can be used for a direct visualization of the molecule, e.g. by balls and sticks.</p><p>On the other hand all geometric comparisons and distance measurements between molecular geometries, as they are performed during conformation analysis, rely on relative coordinates, i.e. bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles. In other words, conformations are independent of any rigid transformations that are previously applied to single geometries.  However, the visualization of conformations takes place in Cartesian coordinates. Therefore it is necessary to assign global positions and orientations to the geometries and thereby to define a relative alignment between them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Alignment by Distance Minimization</head><p>Assume we want to use L atoms for the alignment of M geometries of a molecule. Optimal alignment is defined by requiring the positions and orientations of the geometries to minimize a distance based on atom positions. We define the distance between two geometries G1 and G2 as the sum of squared distances between corresponding atoms</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">dL(G1, G2) = L i=1 (a i 1 − a i 2 ) 2 .</formula><p>To evaluate position and orientation of a geometry the distancebased criterion can be applied between the geometry in question and either a reference geometry or all other geometries.</p><p>In the first case, we try to place every geometry as close as possible to the reference, which allows to optimize the position of every geometry separately. The reference can be one of the geometries that should be aligned. In particular, we are looking for rigid transformations Ri(•) minimizing</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">dL(Ri(Gi), G ref ) (i ∈ 1 . . . M )</formula><p>where G ref is the reference geometry and G1, . . . , GM are the geometries to be aligned. According to Kabsch <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> the optimal Ri(•) can be computed in two steps. In the optimal position the barycenters bi = 1 L L j=1 a j i of all geometries coincide. Thus the first step is to translate all geometries in such a way that their barycenters coincide with the barycenter of the reference geometry. The remaining optimization problem merely deals with rotations around this common barycenter. The optimal rotation for the geometry Gi can be found <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> via solving the eigenproblem of the symmetric, positive definite</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">3 ×3 matrix M T i Mi with Mi = L k=1 a k ref ⊗ a k i .</formula><p>Here (a ⊗ b) κλ ≡ aκb λ , where κ, λ denote components of the spatial coordinate vectors. Assuming µ1 ≥ µ2 ≥ µ3 to be the sorted eigenvalues of M T i Mi, let p 1 , p 2 be associated normalized eigenvectors and</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">q j = Mip j (j ∈ 1, 2).</formula><p>Then, with p 3 ≡ p 1 × p 2 and q 3 ≡ q 1 × q 2 , we can compute the optimal rotation matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">U = 3 l=1 q l ⊗ p l .</formula><p>In the second case, the mean squared distance of every geometry to all other geometries is minimized, which requires to optimize all geometries simultaneously. The objective function to be minimized has the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">O = 1≤i&lt;j≤M dL(Ri(Gi), Rj(Gj)).</formula><p>Again the barycenters are translated into coincidence. The remaining objective function only depends on rotations of the geometries around the barycenter. The optimal orientation can be computed by an iterative scheme where every iteration optimizes the rotation of one of the geometries by solving an eigenproblem analogous to the case of alignment to a reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Effectively this step aligns the geometry to the mean of all other geometries. To get a reasonable starting point for the iteration, an alignment of the first type can be performed with one of the geometries as the reference. Although computationally more expensive, the second approach should be preferred as its result does not depend on the choice of a reference, in contrast to the first approach. Based on the described alignment strategies, we use two approaches for visualizing a molecular conformation. Ways to display a representative geometry are presented in Section 4.2 while the computation and display of geometry densities will be explained in Section 4.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Representatives of Conformations</head><p>A metastable conformation can be understood as a fuzzy molecular shape, i.e. a set of molecular shapes that fills a finite part of the space of molecular geometries. One way of visualizing this set of shapes is to depict some representative geometry, that can be interpreted as a shape around which the other geometries are distributed. Representatives can also be used to compute an alignment between two metastable conformations using the techniques described in Section 4.1.</p><p>An approximation of such a representative shape can be computed by first performing an alignment and then averaging every Cartesian atom coordinate over all geometries. This procedure yields mean coordinates for all atoms that generally do not define a realistic shape. Parts of the molecule that are very flexible, especially parts performing big rotations, will be distorted in the mean geometry (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3)</ref>.</p><p>To get a realistic shape we can now search for the geometry with the smallest distance to the mean shape. Using representatives gained by the described procedure we have a way to compare metastable conformations according to the molecular shapes they describe (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Conformational Density</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">The Problem</head><p>Although a conformation representative is an important means for understanding the essential properties of a conformation, it is obviously of limited value. The information about the flexibility of the conformation is lost. What is needed is some kind of probability density of the location of the molecule. One possibility is to accumulate the density of the volume filling primitives abstracting the molecule, namely cylinders and spheres. We call such a density conformational density, since we accumulate the density over all molecular geometries of a metastable conformation, i.e. different representations of the same molecule. Here the problem is, that we normally have to deal with arbitrary translations and rotations of the geometries in a molecular dynamics trajectory. Thus, we need to transform all geometries into a common coordinate system. This can be done by using the alignment procedures described in Section 4.1.</p><p>Rheingans et al. describe a technique for the visualization of molecules with positional uncertainty in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. However, they only consider spheres as volume filling primitives. We found that using spheres only, it is hard to match certain parts of the density to the molecular structure. In order to allow a visual investigation of the internal structure of the conformation, we have extended the computation of positional uncertainty to a second primitive, the bond cylinders. Rheingans et al. further only compute the scalar field for the density. We have extended the method to the computation of color fields in addition to the scalar field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Generation of Discrete Density</head><p>In order to visualize the conformational density, we compute a representation of the density on some discrete uniform grid. We set the bounding box of this grid to the smallest bounding box containing the bounding boxes of all aligned geometries plus some small correction offsets to allow the construction of a uniform grid with equal voxel size along all three axes.</p><p>Generation of Probability Fields. Given the uniform grid we can now accumulate the density over all geometries. For each geometry we take all its volume filling primitives in turn and find all grid nodes enclosed in the primitives. In general, the volume filling primitives of one geometry overlap in some areas. Depending on type and size of the primitives, this overlap can result in nodes counted more than once for a single geometry. In order to prevent this while considering the primitives of a single geometry, we use an additional bit field to keep track of those nodes already counted.</p><p>For the rasterization of the two kinds of primitives, cylinders and spheres, we use an algorithm as proposed by Cohen and Kaufman in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Scan-converting a cylinder is done by first applying an extension of the 2-dimensional Bresenham's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> to three dimensions to compute a voxelization of the cylinder's center line. Second, we rasterize one slice of the cylinder, i.e. a circle, and move this slice to each voxel of the cylinder's center line. To guarantee not to miss a voxel inside the cylinder, the rasterized slice needs to be 6-connected <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. If we want to be exact about the voxel near the hull of the cylinder, we might have to add or remove some voxels close to the border of the rasterized circle. The reason for this is the slight dislocation of the center of the rasterized slice from the real center line.</p><p>Scan-converting a sphere is done in a similar fashion. However, there are two differences to the rasterization of the cylinders. The first difference is that the line along which the rasterized slices are placed is chosen parallel to one of the three main axes. The second difference is that the rasterized slices need to be scaled, i.e. they are not exact copies of the slice going through the center of the sphere, but get smaller, the further away we get from the center.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generation of Color Fields.</head><p>For the visual understanding of the conformational densities and especially for the visual comparison of conformations (conformational densities) it has turned out to be very helpful to color the scalar field according to the atoms which generated the scalar value. In addition to the scalar field we therefore compute a color field with three entries at each grid node, one for red, green, and blue, respectively. For each node inside any of the molecule's volume filling primitives, we add the color to the current color values of the node. Having summed up the colors over all geometries we need to normalize the color values of the field by the scalar value of the respective node. This means that we average the colors which produces good results if the molecule does not fluctuate too much.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">APPLICATION</head><p>In cooperation with researchers aiming at building up an environment for virtual screening under consideration of dynamic molecular conformations, we have developed a molecular visualization extension <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for the visualization system Amira ® . Most of the standard visualization techniques for molecules have been implemented, e.g. wireframe, ball-and-stick, van-der-Waals spheres, and secondary structure representations. In addition we also implemented an algorithm for the generation of a triangular representation of the solvent excluded, solvent accessible, and the van der Waals surface, based on the work of Totrov and Abagyan <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>To address the problem of conformation visualization in Amira we represent discrete samplings of conformational densities as pseudo time series where every sample geometry is a time step. The geometries can be displayed as single time steps or can be animated.</p><p>In the described environment we have integrated the presented visualization techniques for metastable conformations. The tools have been tested on several molecules, three of which are mentioned in this paper. The visualization techniques have been found to be very helpful for visual verification of the algorithms developed for conformational analysis. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> we present running times of the algorithm for several conformations of different molecules. The results of the conformation visualization can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 1 and 3 through 7</ref>. Different aspects are stressed by different visualization techniques. The mean geometry, as it can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> gives a good first impression of the shape of the metastable conformation. Furthermore, it is an important means to bring several conformations of the same molecule into a single coordinate system for comparison. The volume rendering technique depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> is often used to get an impression on how well defined a metastable conformation is. When it comes to comparing several metastable conformation, i.e. densities, we often use iso-surfaces as can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 1 and 6</ref>. They allow to concentrate on the main features. Coloring the iso-surfaces with the conformational color field greatly facilitates the comparison.</p><p>The implemented features for the visualization of dynamic molecular conformations are also illustrated in the accompanying movie. The movie shows a pseudo time series of the molecule Epigallocatechin-Gallat with 11,000 geometries.  In the movie we first show a 360 degree rotation of a single time step and then animate the pseudo time series. For this animation we use the alignment techniques described in Section 4.1. In particular, the Carbon atoms of the top 6-ring have been chosen to be aligned over all time steps. Therefore this ring appears quite static while the rest, especially the bottom rings exhibit strong positional variations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref> contains some snapshots from the movie.</p><p>For the movie we computed the density over the whole trajectory and visualized it by direct volume rendering. The visual impression of accumulation was produced by fading via a global transparency factor.</p><p>The pseudo trajectory contains two conformations and can thus be separated into two sub-trajectories representing the respective conformational densities. In the last sequence these densities are visualized by a yellow and a brown isosurface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We have presented techniques for visualizing molecular conformations, a task that deals with the variation of molecular shape. We computed mean shapes of conformations, which are typically not realistic molecular shapes, and extracted realistic geometries that are most similar to the mean.</p><p>Further we computed a conformational density by superposing molecular shapes after application of a suitable alignment that can be influenced by user interaction. The conformational density was visualized by direct volume rendering to show the fuzziness of the shape a conformation represents. To emphasize the main shape the density was also visualized with an isosurface.</p><p>All the described techniques are integrated in the visualization system Amira ® and can also be employed simultaneously for the same or for different conformations to allow comparative visualization.</p><p>An essential problem of the described approach is the choice of a useful alignment. An alignment that tries to minimize the fluctuation of all atoms at a time will lead to a picture that shows a moderate fuzziness all over the molecule and gives no impression of rigid and flexible regions. If the user has identified a rigid group of atoms, maybe by chemical intuition, the alignment can be restricted to this group. The result is a picture where the rigid group appears rigid as expected and the other parts of the molecule appear fuzzier the longer their distance is to the aligned group of atoms. An equally rigid second group of atoms can then be difficult to recognize. Our future activities will aim on strategies for automatic generation of useful alignments.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>IEEE</head><label></label><figDesc>Visualization 2002 Oct. 27 -Nov. 1, 2002, Boston, MA, USA 0-7803-7498-3/02/$17.00 © 2002 IEEE</figDesc></figure>
