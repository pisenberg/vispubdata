<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Large and highly detailed volumetric models are very common now in research environments due to improvements in hardware technology and computational methods. Lately, they have found their place in research areas like computational vector field simulation, finite element analysis, medical imaging, range scanning, and large-scale visualization. Scientists employ a number of techniques like contour detection and iso-contouring, contour connection, iso-surface generation, voxel-based tessellation, etc., to create these models, mostly to simulate a natural or engineering phenomenon. However, since these techniques do not always take the requirements for efficient rendering into account during creation stages, the resulting models often turn out to be very complex in terms of the number of geometric primitives and their spatial relationship. Thus, when these models are broken down to rendering primitives like triangles or quadrilaterals for the purpose of visualization, the large number of primitives poses a challenge to interactive rendering. Each of these primitives might have associated attributes like scalar values, vector tuples, etc., as results of scientific simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, or direct visual attributes like color, transparency, texture, normal vector information, etc. It is well known that such meshes are often inefficient in terms of storage, access, and transmission over computer network media.</p><p>To add to these complexities, some scientific and engineering simulations output four-or higher-dimensional (e.g., timevarying) datasets in the form of higher order simplicial complexes (polyhedral meshes), both homogeneous and heterogeneous. The most common examples of homogeneous polyhedral meshes are tetrahedral grids, because of factors like the convex shape of the tetrahedral elements, which makes them suitable for volume rendering. A typical example is an earthquake simulation dataset <ref type="bibr">(11,800,639 vertices, 69,448,288 tetrahedra)</ref>, which takes about 3.3 gigabytes of storage space just for the basic node geometry and the tetrahedral connectivity information, and an additional 141 megabytes for associated vector information for 120 timesteps in each node. Visualizing such large-scale volumetric meshes with time-varying attributes interactively is still an open research area.</p><p>Mesh simplification has been addressed in a number of publications in recent years as a preprocessing step to reduce the geometric complexity of both polygonal and polyhedral meshes. Both refinement-and decimation-based strategies have been explored. Most of these publications extend 'edge collapse'-based decimation methods to volumetric meshes, focusing on accurate error evaluation metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, while also preventing meshinconsistencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. These methods work very well as metrics-guided simplification tools. However, the timecomplexities of these algorithms (Please see section 2.2) discourage their application upon massive datasets of the order of one million or more elements. This paper describes a rapid tetrahedral mesh simplification framework, which employs the mesh consistency constraints, binds the geometric and attribute field errors; and at the same time provides better spatial control over LoDs. Specifically, we employ a symmetric reduction operation: TetFuse, which suits the natural re-distribution of volume among a reduced number of elements upon every decimation step. We present TetFusion as a progressive simplification algorithm to create macroLoDs of both static and time-varying tetrahedral meshes. Finally, we discuss how this approach can assist in interactive visualization of timevarying volumetric datasets of tetrahedral nature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">RELATED WORK</head><p>We classify recent publications in the area of mesh simplification broadly into two categories: those based upon polygonal mesh reduction techniques, and those employing polyhedral mesh reduction techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Polygonal Mesh Simplification</head><p>The class of algorithms that simplify polygonal (2-manifold) surface meshes fall into this category. Most of the work discussed here is based on geometry reduction techniques, that eliminate one or more geometric primitives at a time based on specific constraining criteria, and then consolidate the mesh making use of a smaller number of primitives. The area of polygonal mesh simplification has seen some significant improvements lately.</p><p>Schroeder et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> propose a simple multi-pass vertex decimation algorithm for triangular meshes. The hole resulting from a vertex-removal is re-triangulated with a smaller number of triangles. Turk <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> describes a surface re-tiling algorithm for simplification, where new vertices are sprayed onto the original mesh following topological and geometry constraints, which are triangulated to yield an approximation of the original mesh.</p><p>The work by Kalvin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> describes a computationally efficient surface approximation algorithm, which identifies quasicoplanar faces over the mesh in the form of patches, which are retriangulated with a smaller number of primitives. Their greedy face-merging algorithm has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of polygon faces in the original mesh. Further, this algorithm is more effective in reducing the polygon count in a given polygonal mesh, because of the decimation of multiple primitives per step.</p><p>Hoppe <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> proposes a novel progressive continuous-resolution representation of 2-manifold triangular meshes. He claims that out of the three basic primitive mesh-simplification operations of edge collapse, edge split, and edge swap, an 'edge collapse' is all that is needed for effective progressive simplification of meshes. The primitive operation of 'edge collapse' is presented as a completely reversible operation with 'vertex split' as its counter-operation. This work shows how a mesh could be represented as a basic mesh (the simplified version) and a series of 'vertex split' records that can be applied to refine the basic mesh back to the original representation at full resolution. This representation permits geomorphing and progressive transmission along with significant compression and support for selective refinement.</p><p>Schroeder <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> extends his previous work on triangle mesh decimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. He proposes a new algorithm that guarantees a specified level of reduction, but modifies the topology while performing local decimation to achieve the result. He includes two additional primitive operations in the algorithm: vertex split, and vertex merge. Compression ratios as high as 200:1 can be achieved for some models. Finally, Garland and Heckbert <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> suggest a more organized way of representing error metrics in terms of quadrics for efficient calculation of hierarchy for viewdependent simplification using edge collapses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Polyhedral Mesh Simplification</head><p>Only a few attempts have been made towards polyhedral mesh simplification lately. Both refinement-and decimation-based strategies have been explored in this pursuit. For a detailed note on these strategies, we suggest a reference to the survey report on multi-resolution modeling by Garland <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This section focuses specifically on decimation strategies because they closely relate to our methods described in the next section.</p><p>Trotts et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> extend polygonal geometry reduction techniques for tetrahedral meshes. The authors propose a tetrahedral collapse operation as a sequence of three edge collapses, while keeping the overall error (based on a unique spline-segment representation of each tetrahedron) below a tolerance range. The paper discusses problems and difficulties specific to tetrahedral mesh simplification, and presents a framework to employ edge-collapse to decimate tetrahedra. Because the decimation strategy is based upon successive 'edge collapses', the authors mention the overwhelming overheads for maintaining an edge data structure for massive volumetric datasets. Further, the time complexity of the algorithm presented was not evident in the results or discussion <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>In their work on progressive tetrahedralization, Staadt and Gross <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> explore a specialized case of progressive simplicial complexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>: tetrahedra. Again, the most basic reduction operation proposed is 'edge collapse'. In this manner, the algorithm is very similar to the progressive meshes work by Hoppe <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Besides preserving the topological and geometric features such as boundary, the algorithm elegantly handles previously undiscussed cases of 'negative tetrahedra' (flipping) and tetrahedron-boundary intersections at concave interiors. However, because of the expensive dynamic mesh-consistency tests for these special cases, the time complexity of this algorithm is discouraging for rapid simplification of very large datasets. For example, the algorithm took about 5 hours to simplify a 576,576 elements mesh <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Trotts et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> extend their earlier work on tetrahedral mesh simplification <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Their aim is to cause minimal error when degenerating the mesh by binding the degeneration error to the deviation of a simplified scalar field from the original field. Using this method, they claim that the complex energy terms and weights in error evaluation can be eliminated. Further, they revert to a single edge collapse as the atomic decimation operation, unlike their previous work, where they implement a sequence of three edge collapses to result in one 'tetrahedron collapse' operation. The authors reason that the latter causes complex topological problems and degeneration. This publication reports the simplification times for a range of datasets, which makes it evident that an algorithm of lower time-and computationalcomplexity could still be explored. Their best performing algorithm reportedly took 2,557 minutes (about 42 hours) to simplify a 449,890-element blunt fin dataset by 83.9%.</p><p>Emphasizing accurate error evaluation techniques, Cignoni et al.</p><p>[3] present a framework for integrated error evaluation for both domain and field approximations. This paper focuses on accuracy in calculation and prediction of error introduced in the domain of a tetrahedral mesh as a result of 'edge-collapse'-based decimation strategies. Local accumulation, gradient difference, and brute force strategies are explored to predict and evaluate errors while incrementally simplifying a mesh. This paper is a good survey of more accurate error constraint implementations, and offers various options that need to be tested with rigorous decimation strategies like TetFusion. Some error metrics are given in the next section. A recent work by Edelsbrunner <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> provides an extensive study on ensuring topological correctness in triangle mesh simplification. This work can be generalized to polyhedral meshes to ensure preservation of topological features during simplification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">TETFUSION</head><p>We present TetFuse as a new reversible atomic decimation operation for tetrahedral meshes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">TetFusion: Properties and Effects</head><p>We discuss the inherent properties and effects of TetFusion as a decimation algorithm for tetrahedral meshes:</p><p>Symmetry: For each instance of TetFuse, each one of the affected tetrahedra suffers the same magnitude of displacement of its prey vertex (V P ), which equals the circumradius of the prey tetrahedron T P (this can be proved easily by noting that for each affected tetrahedron, its prey vertex is displaced by the same magnitude of length towards and onto the barycenter of the corresponding prey tetrahedron in question).</p><p>Rigorous decimation: Upon each instance of TetFuse, at least 11 tetrahedra are collapsed for a non-boundary prey tetrahedron. This includes the prey tetrahedron; exactly 4 tetrahedra each sharing one of the four faces with the prey tetrahedron; and at least 6 more tetrahedra each sharing exactly one of the six edges with the prey tetrahedra. This means a 'higher' lower bound on the decimation ratio per step than an 'edge collapse'.</p><p>Avoids flipping: Because of symmetry property of the decimation operation, the vertex that an affected tetrahedron shares with the prey tetrahedron (the shared vertex) tends to move away from its base plane (the plane formed by the other three vertices of the affected tetrahedron. Please see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 2</ref>). Hence, most of the time the ordering of vertices in an affected tetrahedron does not change from its original configuration; and its volume is represented correctly. However, to avoid flipping completely, an early rejection test is employed. This test is discussed in section 3.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discourages self-intersections of the boundary: At any instance, the algorithm gives spatial control over the level of detail of a mesh by:</head><p>-localizing the region of simplification; and -limiting the Maximum Base Vector Stretch Ratio.</p><p>It has been verified that self-intersections of boundaries in the case of irregular tetrahedral meshes occur only at sharp edges and corners <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, when an affected tetrahedron pierces through one or more of the boundary faces of a boundary tetrahedron. TetFusion handles such cases by not allowing any boundary tetrahedron to 'stretch' as a result of the collapse of a prey tetrahedron (localization); and by binding the Maximum Base Vector Stretch Ratio.</p><p>Discourages element-boundary intersections at concave boundary regions: Cases of element-boundary intersection occur when an interior tetrahedron stretches through and over a concave boundary region. In the current version of TetFusion, such cases cannot be prevented completely; but can be reduced by limiting the expansion of an affected tetrahedron (by limiting its maximum volume at any instant), and by not allowing tetrahedra in the vicinity of the boundary surface to stretch as a result of the collapse of a prey tetrahedron.</p><p>Locks the aspect ratio: If the relative edge-aspect ratios of an affected tetrahedron go beyond a pre-specified threshold value as a result of the fusion of a prey tetrahedron, fusion is not allowed. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Attribute Error Binding Tests</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Boundary Preservation Test</head><p>The current version of TetFusion does not affect (stretch) any of the boundary tetrahedra T B . This is accomplished in the following manner:</p><p>-No boundary tetrahedron T B is selected as a prey tetrahedron for TetFusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-</head><p>No interior tetrahedron T i that affects a boundary tetrahedron is selected as a prey tetrahedron for TetFusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test III. Boundary preservation test:</head><p>if T is -an interior tetrahedron, and -does not affect (stretch) any of the boundary tetrahedra, T passes this test.</p><p>Thus, the current version of TetFusion preserves the geometry and topology of the boundary surface perfectly. We believe that an additional pass in the current algorithm would further improve the reduction ratios. This pass would simplify the boundary tetrahedra, and would still preserve the topology and the sharp features. It would be based upon one or more of the efficient polygonal mesh simplification algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. We plan to extend this work as a future step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Flipping Prevention Test</head><p>For the case of TetFusion, flipping would only occur when the shared vertex of an affected tetrahedron T A moves below the base triangle P TA formed by the remaining three vertices (please see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>). We employ an early-rejection test to completely avoid such flipping cases. This test is similar to the approaches already in use in mesh simplification algorithms for checking intersections, or folding cases.</p><p>Test IV. Given a prey tetrahedron T P . For each affected tetrahedron T A that shares exactly one vertex V s with T P : if V s moves to the other side of the base plane P TA upon one instance of TetFusion of T P , T P fails this test. else T P passes this test. For symmetrically vertex-adjacent tetrahedra that form a star pattern onto the shared vertex <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 2</ref>), the shared vertex always tends to remain on the same side of its respective base planes in reference to each of the affected tetrahedra.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">A Locally Greedy Algorithm</head><p>We present TetFusion as a locally greedy algorithm that makes incremental passes over the whole mesh, examining each tetrahedron in turn for fusion within pre-specified geometric and scalar attribute error bounds.</p><p>An outline of a single pass of the algorithm over an unstructured tetrahedral mesh M is described below (note that macroLoDCounter is a numeric counter identifying the macroLoDs of M uniquely): To obtain multiple macroLoDs, multiple passes of the algorithm have to be run incrementally over the last macroLoD obtained until no more fusions are allowed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">Dynamic Tests</head><p>It is important to note that using our approach, cases of elementboundary intersections cannot be avoided completely (they can only be minimized), especially when high decimation ratios are required. Thus, elegant intersection tests avoiding such cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> can be employed, which might increase the time-complexity of the algorithm. However, because of the rigorous simplification approach employed in TetFusion (higher reduction ratio per step), the upper bound on time-performance is still expected to be lower than that of the other 'edge collapse'-based methods. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">RESULTS</head><p>Tables 1.1 through 1.4 summarize the results obtained from sample runs of TetFusion on a number of datasets.</p><p>The spx dataset provides concave boundary regions and curved boundary sections to verify the intersection tests employed in the algorithm. The blunt fin dataset provides a nice distribution of a scalar attribute to verify the scalar attribute error binding employed in TetFusion. The earthquake simulation dataset has spatially and temporally localized Regions of Interest (RoIs) to test the rapid macroLoD creation for time-varying datasets. Finally, the delta wing dataset was chosen to analyze the scalability of the algorithm to fairly large-scale (about a million elements) datasets.</p><p>Please note that for this set of results, the initial and limiting values of the control parameters ( S and R MAX ) have been decided by the user. These parameters are characteristic of the homogeneity of the geometry and field attributes in a dataset, and cannot be determined automatically in the current version of the algorithm.</p><p>We are experimenting with binding the domain and field errors during simplification in pursuit of a semi-automated simplification algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We presented a framework for rapid progressive simplification of tetrahedral meshes. The proposed algorithm (TetFusion) -features a rigorous decimation scheme, and hence is fast; -is more 'intuitive' for 3D volumetric meshes than 'edge collapse'-based methods; -is 'symmetric' in terms of release of the fusion energy (all the affected tetrahedra suffer the same magnitude of 'stretch'); -provides a combination of control parameters for a smooth and controlled transition through a series of LoDs of a mesh at a macro level (macroLoDs); -avoids cases of flipping and negative volume tetrahedra; and discourages cases of self-intersection of boundaries, and element-boundary intersections at concave boundary regions.</p><p>However, there are some limitations of using the current version of the algorithm: -boundary tetrahedra are not treated at all, resulting into low compression ratios. Additional compression could still be achieved by decimation of external faces of the boundary tetrahedra using 'edge collapse'-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>, or by concise representations of the boundary surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. For further offline compression of the datasets, schemes like the ones suggested by Gumhold et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Pajarola et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, or Szymczak et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> present a compatible platform for integration with TetFusion. -the control parameters and the error bounds have to be decided by the user. More sophisticated error-control methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> and topological constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> need to be incorporated, and are being worked on. -self-intersection of boundaries, and element-boundary intersections cannot be avoided completely.</p><p>Applications: This framework can be employed in rapid creation of macroLoDs for large time-varying datasets, e.g., earthquake simulation. One such dataset, with over 69 million tetrahedra, has characteristic localized scalar and vector attributes per time-step <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. (The region of interest (ROI) varies per time-step.) Because of the inherent spatial control of decimation, TetFusion can be used to rapidly create macroLoDs with rigorous decimation in regions outside the ROI. These macroLoDs (one per time-step) with high decimation ratios can be explored for interactive temporal visualization.

The (red) center tetrahedron is the one to collapse onto its barycenter (prey tetrahedron). The four other (blue) tetrahedra are the affected ones, which stretch in the direction of the prey tetrahedron's barycenter. Note that for any affected tetrahedron, the vertex it shares with the prey tetrahedron moves 'away' from the base plane formed by its other three vertices (flipping discouraged). Further, at least eleven tetrahedra collapse as a result of TetFusion of an interior tetrahedron in a complete mesh. (High decimation per step. Please see section 3.2).</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>An illustration of a case of flipping because of TetFusion. The right (red) tetrahedron is the one to collapse onto its barycenter (prey tetrahedron). The left one (blue) is the affected one. As a result of collapse, V s moves to the other side of the base plane P TA . Such cases are expected to be rare because of symmetric re-distribution of space amongst affected tetrahedra because of TetFusion. As a result, no two tetrahedra of asymmetric volume distribution can be vertex-adjacent as they are shown in the figure, unless they are present in the original mesh.</figDesc></figure>
