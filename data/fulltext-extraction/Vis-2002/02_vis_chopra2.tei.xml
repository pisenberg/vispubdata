			<abstract>
				<p>This paper is a documentation of techniques invented, results obtained and lessons learned while creating visualization algorithms to render outputs of large-scale seismic simulations. The objective is the development of techniques for a collaborative simulation and visualization shared between structural engineers, seismologists, and computer scientists. The computer graphics research community has been witnessing a large number of exemplary publications addressing the challenges faced while trying to visualize both large-scale surface and volumetric datasets lately. From a visualization perspective, issues like data preprocessing (simplification, sampling, filtering, etc.); rendering algorithms (surface and volume), and interaction paradigms (large-scale, highly interactive, highly immersive, etc.) have been areas of study. In this light, we outline and describe the milestones achieved in a large-scale simulation and visualization project, which opened the scope for combining existing techniques with new methods, especially in those cases where no existing methods were suitable. We elucidate the data simplification and reorganization schemes that we used, and discuss the problems we encountered and the solutions we found. We describe both desktop (high-end local as well as remote) interfaces and immersive visualization systems that we developed to employ interactive surface and volume rendering algorithms. Finally, we describe the results obtained, challenges that still need to be addressed, and ongoing efforts to meet the challenges of largescale visualization.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>This case study describes the techniques invented and lessons learned in transition from 2D contour plots to immersive volume visualization. The application is a simulation and visualization of Seismic Performance of Urban Regions (SPUR). We present ideas, models, challenges, and algorithms that encompass every stage of the project, from 2D plots to our recent near-interactive volume visualization system. A team of civil engineers, structural engineers, and computer scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon University at Pittsburgh, and the Engineering Research Center at Mississippi State University has been pursuing this ongoing effort to model and visualize seismic performance. Civil engineers from the team at CMU created a model of ground motion in a basin with a source of seismic energy (epicenter) that travels along a fault. Structural engineers from UCB simulate the response of structural units on the top surface of this basin model based on the ground motion attributes.</p><p>The computer graphics group implemented visualization algorithms and techniques to better understand these two model simulations in a single, common 'picture'. The basic geometry of the dataset consists of 11,800,639 vertices forming 69,448,288 tetrahedral cells. The domain of the dataset comprises four dimensions, and each vertex has a velocity vector in 800 time steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">GROUND MOTION SIMULATIONS</head><p>We describe a finite element formulation for modeling earthquake ground motion in sedimentary basins. The basin is modeled as a three-dimensional isotropic, heterogeneous anelastic medium. The domain is limited by absorbing boundaries that limit the amount IEEE Visualization 2002 Oct. 27 -Nov. 1, 2002, Boston, MA, USA 0-7803-7498-3/02/$17.00 © 2002 IEEE and magnitude of spurious reflections. Previous generation of simulation was performed over the same basin geometry but with a point source of energy (please see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> for a point set rendering of one time step from the same basin with a point source). Currently, simulation is performed over the idealized model shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. The model incorporates an idealized extended strike-slip fault aligned with the coordinate system. The shaded area in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> represents such a fault. The computer analysis is performed on a Cray T3E parallel computer at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. A total of 128 processors took almost 24 hours to calculate and store an 8 second velocity history of approximately 12 million nodes arranged in a threedimensional grid. The required amount of disk space for this problem was approximately 130 GB.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> shows examples of 2D contour plots that civil engineers create as a first visualization aid for ground motion simulations. Although being just planar representations of the spread of seismic energy over time, these plots give very good insight into the behavior of the model, and also act as benchmarks to test and evaluate higher-order visualizations of the same simulations. 2D contour plots have been effective tools for civil engineers to understand the results of such simulations. However, these contours are not very intuitive when it comes to four-dimensional simulations that encompass the temporal dimension. The fact that there are two simulations that are performed over the same model (ground motion and structural response) adds to the complexity of the problem. To visualize the results of both simulations in an effective manner with today's technology has been one of the challenges of this project. The following sections describe the methods used to tackle this problem.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">VISUALIZATION METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Static Point Set Rendering</head><p>Point set rendering was the first algorithm that was used to visualize the results of the simulations. The rendering was static, and the vertices were rendered one at a time. This first step gave insight into the third dimension of the dataset: it provided depth cues in addition to the surface information. All of the 11,800,639 vertices of the basin geometry were fed into the rendering pipeline of an SGI TM Octane as points, neglecting the tetrahedral connectivity information. Selected time steps were chosen, with and color representing the velocity vector magnitudes. The results matched the contour plots for a point energy source, and the energy spread symmetrically. Also, this visualization verified the deliberately higher density of vertices near the top surface of the basin <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 4</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Geometry-based Surface Rendering</head><p>In pursuit of a more interactive visualization system for all time steps, we explored images from point set renderings of the simulation, and identified the top layer as a region of interest (ROI). This layer was chosen because it best represents the effects of a seismic pulse on structural units at the ground level. This toplayer extraction tremendously reduced the amount of geometry that needs to be sent to the rendering pipeline. This layer forms a triangle mesh surface. Structural response simulations were performed for a select group of vertices on this mesh. Constrained random selection avoids cluttering of structural units in the rendered images. The extracted surface consists of just 57,121 nodes (222,790 triangles), and represents only the topmost layer of the layered basin model. This helped in maintaining interactive frame rates, keeping up with the 3D motion trackers for interactive display, and avoiding delayed responses in navigable environments, as described in section 3.3. The algorithm worked well in an interactive, navigable visualization environment. We were thus able to successfully visualize all four dimensions (including time) of two dependent simulations (ground motion and structural response) in the same animated image. As an alternative output modality and to make the visualization system available remotely, an interactive simulation and visualization web-portal was developed that generates structural response data for selected ground motion and location parameters on the fly (batch mode). The web portal enables the user to specify different views from different locations around the model. Rendered images are returned to the browser as animated GIF images, or as an MPEG movie.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Structural Response Visualization</head><p>The structural response simulation from the Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering Department at Berkeley allowed buildings of same structural properties to be replicated on the top layer of the basin as primitive structural units (single degree-offreedom, SDOF models). Both from a modeling and visualization perspective, each one of them could be modeled as a stick with a mass on the top, which moves in response to the shaking ground.</p><p>In order to create a meaningful visualization for the Civil Engineers, we added four different visual cues to the visualization: the color of the surface nodes (velocity vector magnitude), the color of the roofs (structural response magnitude), displacement of the vertices of the basin (ground motion), and constrained motion of the tops of the buildings with their bases fixed to one of the nodes on the triangle mesh on the top layer of the basin (structural response).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Immersion</head><p>The temporal visualization of the results of the simulation was ported to interactive virtual environments, i.e., an ImmersaDesk TM and a four-walled CAVE Automated Virtual Environment (CAVE TM ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. This added two more cues: stereo immersion, and audio ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 5:</head><p>Geometry-based surface rendering of the top layer of the basin with structural units on selected vertices. Audio was added to give the user a feeling for the time that has elapsed since the earthquake occurred and how close it is. This snapshot is from the immersive visualization system in a CAVE TM .</p><p>Although at this stage the behavior of the simulation models had been well understood, there was still much more to explore in the interior of the basin's volume. The next issue we studied was the spread of seismic energy from the epicenter before the earthquake's shock wave strikes the top layer. Thus, our next goal was to render the basin's volume with sufficient interactivity to allow the visualization of the eruption of seismic energy and its spread to the structural units on the top layer. We implemented novel progressive data reduction techniques for level-of-detail (LOD) prototyping of tetrahedral meshes of this scale (of the order of a 100 million cells), employing both geometry decimation and wavelets to re-organize the interior of the dataset for a more efficient representation (section 4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Volume Rendering</head><p>After geometry decimation and data reduction as pre-processing steps to reduce the size-complexity of the whole dataset, the geometry was sampled into a regular rectilinear voxel grid. Special precautions were taken to avoid aliasing and supersampling artifacts. This drastically reduced the size of the dataset from 14.16 GB to just 1.27 GB for the first 100 time steps. The dataset was then mapped into a 3D texture buffer. This compressed, node-indexed, binary re-organization aided in achieving near-interactive frame rates (&lt; 3 frames per sec.) for 3D texture-based volume visualization of the model. Applying affine transformations on 3D texture coordinates of the volume provided the desired interactivity to the visualization system. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1 and  6</ref> show the resulting snapshots from this system. Results of near-interactive volume visualization of the first few time steps (when the earthquake is still in its early stages) provided evidence that this visualization method is suitable for large-scale rendering. The resulting animated images comply with the orthogonal response of the fault region of the simulation model. The later time steps show the eruption and the effects on the soil and the surface.</p><p>Currently, a desktop visualization system and a CAVE TM system are operational. The desktop application supports a flight around the fault region where the seed cell of the earthquake can be seen in its early stages, as if it were breathing; ready to erupt, which is a breath-taking sight! Immersion adds additional cues (stereo vision, sound, walk-through navigation, etc.) to stimulate the senses of the observer.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">ONGOING AND FUTURE WORKS</head><p>This large-scale data research study aims at enabling interactive visualization of large datasets in a virtual environment (ImmersaDesk TM , CAVE TM ) in real-time using hierarchical visualization techniques and level-of-detail methods. Specifically, new data based techniques need to be explored, such as top-layer extraction, isolation of regions-of-interest in both spatial and temporal domain, etc. The goal is to make effective digital story telling possible for simulation engineers and scientists using virtual environments.</p><p>We are currently working on the following five aspects of the project:</p><p>• Better simulation, i.e., more complex datasets, with geological faults.</p></div>
