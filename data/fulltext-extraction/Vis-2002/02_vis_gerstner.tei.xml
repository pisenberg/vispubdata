				<p>Weather radars can measure the backscatter from rain drops in the atmosphere. A complete radar scan provides three-dimensional precipitation information. For the understanding of the underlying atmospheric processes interactive visualization of these data sets is necessary. This is a challenging task due to the size, structure and required context of the data. In this case study, a multiresolution approach for real-time simultaneous visualization of radar measurements together with the corresponding terrain data is illustrated.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Remote sensing of meteorological quantities is necessary in order to understand and model atmospheric processes. An important example is weather radar with which the backscatter from atmospheric hydrometeors (e.g. rain drops, hail, or snow flakes) can be measured. Such a radar antenna is typically mounted on a hill or a high building and is busy scanning its surrounding sky. The measured radar reflectivities are protocolled as scalar values in 3D space. Since the scans are repeated regularly this leads to very large timedependent scalar fields which have to be stored and processed.</p><p>The radar reflectivity is proportional to the sixth power of the diameter of the backscattering particle, but the distribution of the particles is unknown. Thus, the determination of the amount of rain which will ultimately arrive at the ground (which one is of course most interested in) is difficult. The three-dimensional structure contains information which can improve rainfall rate estimates which is crucial for hydrological modelling and simulations.</p><p>For the understanding and conveyance of the data, interactive volume visualization tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> within visual geographic information systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> are required. However, due to the large size of the data it is difficult to achieve real-time visualization performance. Furthermore, the data has to be put in a context for better comprehension, e.g. by additionally rendering the local terrain <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, which makes the task even more involved (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>. Thereby, the amount of data which has to be displayed is further increased and the simultaneous display of volume and surface data leads to algorithmic visualization problems.</p><p>In this case study we address these problems by adaptive multiresolution algorithms. Multiresolution methods allow a fast coarse <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Four images visualizing a heavy local rainfall event on May 3rd, 2001 in northwestern Germany. Shown is the terrain and 20 transparent isosurfaces with low opacity and color ranging from white to blue. Displayed is an overview image, a top view, a bird's view, and a closeup on the event. display of the data for overview images or interaction, while higher resolution is used when zooming into the data or for detail images. The algorithms are adaptive in the sense that the resolution does not have to be uniform everywhere but may be variable in space. For example, in smooth areas a lower resolution can be sufficient to provide a good representation of the data while in areas with greater variation a higher resolution is used. The adaptive refinement is controlled by suitable error indicators which can be specified by the user.</p><p>A multiresolution hierarchy is constructed for both volume and surface data. Although these multiresolution models are built independently, they are constructed in a matching way. In our case, the 3D model is based on recursive tetrahedral bisection and the 2D model is based on recursive triangle bisection. The employed volume visualization algorithm is based on the simultaneous extraction of several transparent isosurfaces. In our experience, the display of isosurfaces appears to be more meaningful to people from the atmospheric sciences than direct volume rendering. Also, we will show that in this way interactive visualization performance can be achieved without the usage of special-purpose hardware (apart from a standard graphics card).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">THE WEATHER RADAR</head><p>The radar antenna is mounted on top of a 7-storey residential building in Bonn (geographical position 70 • 04 E, 50 • 43 N) in a height of 98.5 meters over sea level. It is operated in a continuous mode (save maintenance). The antenna is able to rotate 360 degrees around its vertical axis (azimuth angle) and tilt up to 90 degrees with respect to the horizontal plane (elevation angle). For each combination of azimuth and elevation angle reflectivities along the shot ray are obtained. The measurement radius is 50 km.</p><p>The raw data sets have been obtained for a 1 degree resolution of the azimuth angle, for elevation angles of 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 12.0, and 15.0 degrees, and for 200 equidistant points along each ray. In summary, each time-slice of raw data consists of 360 × 200 × 9 floating point values.</p><p>A circular scan for each elevation angle forms an -albeit very flat -cone (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). One complete 3D scan takes 5 minutes and is repeated every 30 minutes (in the meantime the radar is not idle but scans only the smallest elevation angle in a higher time resolution). The scanned volume is roughly 55,000 km 3 covering about 7,900 km 2 .</p><p>The receiver of the radar system measures the power of the reflected pulse. To relieve the measurements from their dependency on range and the properties of the radar system, the data is usually converted into the so called radar reflectivity (factor) Z. The link between Z and the rain rate R is called Z-R relationship and depends on the unknown drop size distribution within the illuminated volume. Using approximations for the drop size distribution and the fall velocity, formulas of the form Z = aR b can be derived. In our examples we use a = 300 and b = 1.5.</p><p>The raw data is given in a conical coordinate system. Although the data could be visualized in this coordinate system, this is impractical for two reasons. First, it would be hard to match the three-dimensional radar mesh with the two-dimensional terrain grid. This would be necessary for the solution of mutual visibility problems of the rainfall and terrain data. Second, the conical mesh is circular along the azimuth angle and thus not homeomorphic to a cubical mesh. This would require a special treatment of the circularity which is difficult (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>).</p><p>In order to avoid these problems, we interpolated the data set onto a cubical grid with 400 × 400 × 66 grid points using trilinear interpolation. In comparison to the conical grid, the resolution of the cubical grid is about a factor of 2 higher in lateral direction and a factor of 7 higher in elevation direction in order to minimize the interpolation error. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: The mutual occlusion problem: part of the rainfield is located in between two mountains. Rendering the opaque terrain first and then the transparent rainfield does not lead to correct results. In principle, an interleaved traversal of the terrain and rainfield meshes is required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Multiresolution Hierarchy</head><p>Let us consider a hierarchy of triangular or tetrahedral grids generated by recursive bisection. To this end, the midpoint of a predetermined edge is chosen as a refinement vertex and the triangle or tetrahedron is split in two by connecting the refinement vertex with its opposite vertices. Starting with initial meshes consisting of two triangles, respectively six tetrahedra, and recursively splitting all triangles or tetrahedra, nested hierarchical meshes are constructed.</p><p>An adaptive mesh can be extracted from such a hierarchy by selection and computation of a suitable error indicator. Then, only those triangles or tetrahedra are visited whose associated error indicator value is below a user-prescribed error threshold. If the employed error indicator is saturated then the resulting adaptive meshes will not contain so-called hanging nodes which would lead to holes during the visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Terrain Visualization</head><p>For a two-dimensional scalar field, such as terrain data, it is sufficient to draw and shade the triangles on the finest local resolution. An often applied extension is view-dependent refinement <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> which is usually used for low flyovers. Here, the error threshold is not uniformly distributed but increases with the distance to the viewer. For this application, view-dependent refinement was not necessary since, due to the nature of the data, a top or bird's view is mostly used (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). For visualization purposes the triangles are color shaded according to elevation value using a simple geographical colormap ranging from green (low elevation) to white (high elevation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Rainfield Visualization</head><p>Three-dimensional scalar fields require special volume visualization techniques such as volume rendering (e.g. using tetrahedral splats <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>) or isosurface extraction (e.g. using marching tetrahedra <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>). Isosurfaces can be efficiently extracted hierarchically if there are bounds for the minimum and maximum data value inside each tetrahedron available. The extraction algorithm then traverses the hierarchical mesh searching only through those regions where the isosurface is actually located (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>) and extracts the local isosurface using a simple lookup-table on the finest local resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Multiple transparent isosurfaces can be rendered using alpha blending if the tetrahedra and isosurface components are sorted in visibility order <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>In our examples, we visualize the rainfall by up to 20 transparent isosurfaces with low opacity and color ranging from white (low rainfall) to blue (high rainfall). The isovalues are equidistant and the maximum isovalue is determined by the maximum rainfall (up to 50 mm/h) in the data set (single event), respectively the maximum rainfall during the time interval (time series). The isosurface triangles are Gouraud shaded based on the gradients of the 3D data.</p><p>The number of displayed isosurfaces should correspond to the error threshold of the multiresolution algorithm. Clearly, both extremes, a single high-resolution isosurface or many coarsely triangulated isosurfaces, do not give a good volumetric representation of the data. We also noticed that the total number of rendered triangles gives no clue. For example, an image using half the number of isosurfaces but the same error threshold looks worse than an image with the same number of isosurfaces at twice the threshold. In a study we discovered that the number of isosurfaces n is best related to the error threshold ε like n ∼ log(1/ε). This implies a 10-fold increase of the error threshold should roughly lead to a bisection of the number of isosurfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Integration</head><p>In this application, the user focus is clearly on the rainfield. The terrain is mainly displayed for orientation and spatial analysis. Nevertheless, the terrain has to cover a far greater area than the extent of the radar on the ground in order to also provide realistic side views of the rainfield. Therefore, the terrain must extend at least twice the rainfield size in all directions. This way, however, the two meshes cannot be constructed in a matching way in the sense that the z-projection of the 3D mesh will fall exactly onto the 2D mesh.</p><p>In principle, intervisibility between the two data sets is a problem due to the transparency of the isosurfaces which requires alpha blending. For example, if part of the rainfield is located in between two mountains, then the more distant mountain has to be drawn first, then the rainfield, and the closer mountain last (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). This case can occur since the viewing direction does not have to be identical to the direction of the radar ray. However, it did not pose a real problem here since, due to the nature of the radar, the measured rainfield is usually located high above the ground (compare <ref type="figure">Figure  1, right)</ref>. The problem per se is interesting though and would require an interleaved traversal of the two multiresolution hierarchies which is not a trivial problem and subject of current research.</p><p>Due to these two problems we treat the rainfield and the terrain meshes independently from each other as two separate multiresolution hierarchies. In order to achieve sufficiently correct results the terrain is rendered first and the rainfield second.</p><p>However, the coupling of the two error thresholds has to be addressed. Although the two thresholds could be chosen independently, the user should not have to adjust both of then. We solved the problem here by providing the user with a global error ruler and a second ruler which controls the relation between the the two errors. This way, the user can adjust the accuracy of the terrain in comparison to the rainfield once, and use a global error ruler to control fidelity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">EXAMPLES</head><p>We will now illustrate the performance and results of our visualization tool. The first example shows a single rainfall event while the second example covers a time series. In all examples the rainfall data is displayed on top of a 50 m digital elevation model of roughly three times the extent of the measurement area. The height of the terrain data as well as the rainfield data is exaggerated by a factor of 5 in the images. Of course, the height exaggeration can be controlled by the user but this value proved to be the most useful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Single Event</head><p>We will start with a highly localized and heavy rainfall event which occurred on May 3rd, 2001. This event is important since it caused severe damage in the region. The spatial extent of the event on the ground was roughly 100 km 2 . <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: The multiresolution approach for the terrain as well as for the isosurfaces allows scalable performance for the interaction with the data. The images show terrain and isosurface renderings as well as the corresponding 2D and 3D grids for varying error thresholds. <ref type="figure">Figure 1 (upper right)</ref> shows the measurement area (circular with 100 km diameter) in northwestern Germany as viewed from directly above. In the center is the city of Bonn, the river Rhine runs from southeast (Koblenz) to northwest (Cologne). Note that this top view is already more illustrative to the meteorologist than single horizontal slices. The 3D structure of the rainfall is really revealed through interactive rotation and movement through the data set. As an example, <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> (lower left) shows a 70 degree angle (bird's) view of the area. A closeup of the rainfall event as seen from a flat 87 degree angle facing northwest is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1 (lower right)</ref>. Here, the typical formation of rain shafts can be seen. At this high closeup on the upper border aliasing artefacts which result from the employed interpolation (see Section 2) are visible.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> we show the multiresolution performance of the visualization system. Here we depict the corresponding triangular and tetrahedral grids next to the terrain and rainfield. From top to bottom the global error threshold was decreased by a factor of 10 resulting in an increase of the number of triangles also by a factor of 10. We see that the isosurface extraction algorithm refines only in the close vicinity of the isosurface. The terrain is also much coarser in smooth, less mountainous areas such as in the upper part of the images (the Lower Rhine Valley) which substantially increases the overall performance. For the coarser images the number of displayed isosurfaces was reduced from 20 to 10, respectively 5. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Time Series</head><p>As a second example will serve a heavy convective rainfall event which has occurred on July 20th, 2001. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref> we show four images at times 11:22, 11:52, 12:22, and 12:52. The wind blows from southwest and thus the rain front moves roughly from left to right in the images. In these images we clearly see that the radar does not cover the area directly above the antenna (which is located in the center of the images). This problem could be solved by increasing the maximum elevation angle, or using several radar devices with overlapping measurement areas.</p><p>For larger time series the rainfall data should be stored in compressed form (not only on disk but also in memory). Since large parts of the rainfield are typically empty (zero rainfall) this can be achieved by the construction of adaptive tetrahedral meshes which capture the rain data (such as in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> lower right). Then, only the data values in the adaptive mesh together with the corresponding tree structure (which requires only a few bits per vertex) have to be stored. However, this was not necessary for the small time series in the example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Performance</head><p>The complete visualization system is interactive for large error thresholds (as in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> top and middle) while higher resolution images (such as <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> bottom) require a few seconds rendering time on an Intel Pentium III (933 MHz) with a standard nVidia graphics card running Linux. For the bottommost images several million triangles were rendered.</p><p>The user is able to interactively rotate and zoom into the data using lower fidelity images (which are still very detailed, except in extreme closeups). Without any performance penalty the user can change the minimum and maximum isovalues which are displayed as well as the employed colormaps, height exaggeration, viewpoint, and viewing direction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">LESSONS LEARNED</head><p>In our experience, the ability to interactively rotate and zoom through the data greatly enhances the visual impression of the 3D rainfield structure. In comparison to direct volume rendering, the display of multiple isosurfaces together with proper lighting allows an easier transfer of information to the atmospheric and earth scientist. The additional display of the terrain is an absolute necessity for good coordination and exact location of rainfield structures.</p><p>We are certain that the visualization system will help to understand the interplay of the different atmospheric processes and will allow to improve rainfall estimates on the ground based on the measured radar data. With this system the scientist is already able to visualize known atmospheric phenomena such as the formation of rain shafts which have previously not been accessible in this way.</p><p>On the technical side, we got interesting insights concerning the interplay of error estimation, the number of isosurfaces, the number of rendered triangles (fidelity), and the quality of the output images for this kind of application. This will help to further improve the efficiency of multiresolution algorithms.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>IEEE</head><label></label><figDesc>Visualization 2002 Oct. 27 -Nov. 1, 2002, Boston, MA, USA 0-7803-7498-3/02/$17.00 © 2002 IEEE</figDesc></figure>
