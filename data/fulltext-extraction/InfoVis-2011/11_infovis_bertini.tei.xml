			<abstract>
				<p>In this paper, we present a systematization of techniques that use quality metrics to help in the visual exploration of meaningful patterns in high-dimensional data. In a number of recent papers, different quality metrics are proposed to automate the demanding search through large spaces of alternative visualizations (e.g., alternative projections or ordering), allowing the user to concentrate on the most promising visualizations suggested by the quality metrics. Over the last decade, this approach has witnessed a remarkable development but few reflections exist on how these methods are related to each other and how the approach can be developed further. For this purpose, we provide an overview of approaches that use quality metrics in high-dimensional data visualization and propose a systematization based on a thorough literature review. We carefully analyze the papers and derive a set of factors for discriminating the quality metrics, visualization techniques, and the process itself. The process is described through a reworked version of the well-known information visualization pipeline. We demonstrate the usefulness of our model by applying it to several existing approaches that use quality metrics, and we provide reflections on implications of our model for future research.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The extraction of relevant and meaningful information out of highdimensional data is notoriously complex and cumbersome. The curse of dimensionality is a popular way of stigmatizing the whole set of troubles encountered in high-dimensional data analysis; finding relevant projections, selecting meaningful dimensions, and getting rid of noise, being only a few of them. Multi-dimensional data visualization also carries its own set of challenges like, above all, the limited capability of any technique to scale to more than an handful of data dimensions.</p><p>Researchers have been trying to solve these problems through a number of automatic data analysis and visualization approaches that cover the whole spectrum of possibilities: from fully automatic to fully interactive. Visualization researchers have discovered early on that searching for interesting patterns in this kind of data can be done through a mixed approach, where the machine based on quality metrics automatically searches through a large number of potentially interesting projections, and the user interactively steers the process and explores the output through visualization.</p><p>The pioneering work of Friedman and Tukey in 1974 with their projection pursuits method <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref> introduced the idea. They recognized the limit of human beings in exploring the exponential set of projections and tackled the high-dimensionality issue by letting an algorithm discover interesting linear projections in 1D (histograms) and 2D (scatter plots) and letting the user evaluate the corresponding output.</p><p>During the last few years the use of this paradigm has witnessed a growing interest, and an increasing number of techniques has been published in key data visualization conferences and journals. Quality metrics have been used for very disparate goals such as: searching for interesting projections, reducing clutter, and finding meaningful abstractions. However, the initial idea of quality metrics has been elaborated and expanded so much further and into so many different directions that it is hard to come up with a coherent and unified pic- ture for them. A reader of one of these papers may well appreciate the value of a single technique without having a way to place it into a larger context. Also, researchers who might want to approach this area of investigation for the first time and develop new techniques may have a hard time appreciating the whole spectrum of possibilities and directions related to the use of quality metrics. In this paper we move first steps towards filling this gap. We provide a systematization of using quality metrics in high-dimensional data analysis through a literature review. We analyzed numerous papers containing quality metrics and went through an iterative process that led to the definition of a number of factors and a quality metrics pipeline, which is inspired to the traditional information visualization pipeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>.</p><p>The extracted factors and the pipeline have the following interrelated goals: (1) putting the existing methods into a common framework, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(2)</ref> easing the generation of new research in the field, (3) spotting relevant gaps to bridge with future research.</p><p>In the paper, we provide an extensive explanation of the methodology we followed, the results we obtained, and their practical use. In particular, we demonstrate by going through a number of selected examples how we are able to describe existing approaches through the proposed models. Also, we spot a number of interesting gaps and give guidelines on how to carry out new research in this area. To the best of our knowledge, despite the numerous techniques that can be categorized under the umbrella of quality-metrics-driven visualization, this is the first attempt in this direction.</p></div>

In the context of this paper, any dimensionality higher than 10 is considered high-dimensional.</p><p>Our focus is on the analysis of methods that apply quality metrics at any stage of the information visualization pipeline as a way to facilitate the detection and presentation of interesting patterns in highdimensional data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Examples</head><p>We first discuss a few short examples of the approaches covered in our review to familiarize the reader with the concepts exposed in the paper and get the feeling of their heterogeneity.

For a better comparability the visualizations have been cropped after the display of the 4th dimension. We used a size of 50 × 50 for the Hough accumulator in all experiments. The algorithms are quite robust with respect to the size and using more cells generally only increases computation time but has little influence on the result. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref> shows the ranked results for the Parkinsons Disease dataset using our Hough Space Measure.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref> analyze high-dimensional data sets by computing an interestingness score for every scatter plot generated with all the possible combinations of axis pairs from the original data.

It is often perceived that lving only high-cardinality dimensions will place dots in a manner while plots involving low-cardinality dimensions dots in straight lines because a lot of data points share value on this dimension. In this paper, we determine if a is high or low-cardinality depending on the number of ts and their possible values. Let mi denote the number of ata values on the ith dimension, and m denote the total f data points. If mi ≥ √ m, dimension i is considered to be rdinality, otherwise it is low-cardinality. ll treat high-cardinality and low-cardinality dimensions because they generate different plot shapes.

To achieve this goal, the sum of the distances between similar plots to be the easure. In our implementation, we define the plot side In the high-cardinality dimension space, our approach to calculate total clutter for a certain dimension ordering is as follows. Let pi be the ith plot we visit. Let threshold t be the maximum correlation difference between plots that can be called "similar". Note that we are only concerned with the lower-left half of the plots, because the plots are symmetric along the diagonal. The plots along the diagonal will not be considered because they only disclose the correlations of dimensions with themselves. This is always 1.</p><p>In a fixed matrix configuration, we do the following to compute the clutter of the display. First, a correlation matrix M(n, n) is generated for all n high-cardinality dimensions. M[i][ j] represents the Pearson correlation coefficient for the plot on the ith row and jth column. If data number is m, the complexity of building up this matrix is O(m * n 2 ). Then, for any plot pi, we find all the plots that have a similar correlation with it, i.e, the differences between their Pearson correlation coefficients with pi's are within threshold t. This process will take O(n 3 ). We store this information so we only have to do it once.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">The Optimal Dimension Order</head><p>We get a total distance for any scatterplot matrix display. With this measure, comparisons between different displays of the same data can be made. Unlike the one-dimensional parallel coordinates display, we have to calculate distances for every pair of plots. If a pair of plots has similar correlation, their distance is added to the total clutter measure of the display. This is an O(n 2 ) process. An optimal dimension order can be achieved by an exhaustive search with complexity O(n!). Therefore the total computing time will be O(n 2 * n!). Example 2. Peng et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref> provide algorithms to reorder the axes of multi-dimensional data visualizations (parallel coordinates, scatter plot matrices, glyphs, recursive patterns) in order to reduce clutter and make interesting patterns more clearly visible. For each visualization a specific quality metric calculated in the data space is used to find the best ordering. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, we present an example on scatter plot matrix reordering.</p><p>The original data set containing 16384 items.</p><p>Targeting a visual quality of 0.95 retains 987 items. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>.

Johansson et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref> study the abstraction obtained by applying sampling or aggregation algorithms on top of parallel coordinates and provide quality metrics to judge when the abstraction disrupts relevant patterns in the data. In <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> we show an example from their work, where on the left the data set containing 16384 items is displayed with parallel coordinates. On the right side they display an image targeting a visual quality of 0.95 (on a scale from [0,1]) by displaying only 987 items. The image quality is calculated by a screen metric using distance transforms. All the approaches have in common that they use quality metrics in the context of high-dimensional data visualization; nonetheless they can differ on a variety of aspects. For instance, in Example 1 the purpose is to find interesting projections, in Example 2 the purpose is to reduce clutter, whereas the purpose in Example 3 is to find the right abstraction level. The approaches can as well differ in a number of other aspects such as: the visualization techniques employed, the space in which the quality metrics are calculated, or the level of interaction they provide.</p><p>Therefore the questions are: How we can put all the approaches into a common framework which is able to highlight commonalities and differences? What are the main factors through which we can describe them? How can we learn from the approaches and build on top of them to systematically move the idea of quality-metrics driven visualization forward?</p><p>These are the main questions that motivate our work and in the following sections we will provide the results of our investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BACKGROUND</head><p>Quality metrics in visualization have a long history. While in our work we focus only on their specific use in high-dimensional data analysis, they have a broader scope than we can describe here. Early attempts to calculate quality metrics can be traced back to the work of Tufte <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref>, where he proposed metrics such as the data to ink ratio and the lie factor, which respectively optimize the use of the visualization space and reduce the distortions that visualization may introduce. Later in 1997 Richard Brath proposed a rich set of metrics to characterize the quality of business visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref> and, around the same period Miller et al. advocated the use of visualization metrics as a way to compare visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref>. The graph drawing community developed its own set of metrics, most notable aesthetic metrics such as those found in the foundational work of Ware et al. on cognitive measurements of graph aesthetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52]</ref>. Later, the word quality metrics assumed a more specific meaning; in particular it appeared in the context of a number of papers related to clutter reduction and scalability <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">39]</ref>.</p><p>While all these works are related to our goal, early in our project we decided to focus on the use of quality metrics in high-dimensional data exploration only. Our initial data gathering process included a broader class of papers, including those cited above. However we soon realized there is no all encompassing model able to synthesize the relevant aspects and, at the same time, is useful in practice. For this reason the paper focuses only on the use of quality metrics in high-dimensional data.</p><p>There exist a number of research papers which try to categorize existing work in the visualization area. Here we briefly mention some recent ones to put our work in a larger context. In Rethinking Visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[50]</ref> Tory and Möller provide a taxonomy to describe scientific and information visualization under the same structure. Ellis and Dix organize a large number of existing clutter reduction techniques into a clutter reduction taxonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>. Yi et al. review a large number of visualization systems to better understand the role of interaction in visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[60]</ref>. Segel and Heer analyze a large body of story telling visualizations to identify common design patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref>. All these papers share with ours the need of putting some order into a complex aspect of data visualization by starting from a detailed analysis of what researchers and practitioners have proposed in the past.</p><p>Since our proposed systematization uses a data visualization pipeline as the basis for the analysis of quality metrics, we deem important to briefly discuss existing data processing pipelines. The information visualization pipeline has been presented by Card et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref> and is widely accepted as the standard processing model for infor-  <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref> is largely based on the information visualization pipeline and classifies visualizations according to how they use the operators in the pipeline. In this regard it is similar to our work in that we also use elements of the pipeline to classify the papers we have analyzed. The KDD pipeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref> has been developed in the early nineties to describe the data processing stages involved in knowledge discovery. While we took inspiration from this model, as quality metrics involve automatic computation and visualization, we decided not to use it as a basis for our work because visualization does not explicitly appear in the intermediary steps of the process. Keim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref> and Bertini et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref> present alternative pipelines that show how automated data analysis algorithms can be included in the data visualization process. These papers are also sources of inspiration for our work as they focus on the integration of automated algorithms and data visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHODOLOGY</head><p>We followed an iterative data gathering, coding, and modeling approach inspired to the methods used in grounded theory analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>. We started from a small set of papers about quality metrics we knew from our own experience and used this initial list to derive a first set of descriptive factors. After that, we expanded the list by analyzing the references contained in the first set of papers and by searching in relevant visualization venues. In particular, we used Google Scholar 1 to search for references to and from the collected papers. We also expanded our list by targeted keyword search. At this stage we decided to narrow down the scope of our study and focus on quality metrics for high-dimensional data analysis. We discarded the papers that (1) did not explicitly address high-dimensional data, (2) did not propose quality metrics systems or algorithms. For instance we discarded a number of interesting papers on the use of quality metrics for generic data visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>, for graph drawing <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>, or the discussions on generic aspects of quality metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Two of the authors went independently through the current list of papers and completed a table with the current version of the classification and took notes on necessary modifications/additions to accommodate new aspects discovered during the analysis. After this first phase the two lists and the notes where confronted in order to reach a consensus on table factors and paper coding. The third author played the devil's advocate role at this stage to confirm the factors were explicative, understandable and relevant. A third set of additional papers were gathered and coded at this point to test the classification further.</p><p>We proceeded then to the definition of a visualization pipeline able to capture the data visualization processes described in the papers. We started from the traditional information visualization pipeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref> because it is widely known and helps capturing key elements of qualitymetrics-driven visualizations (details in Section 4).</p><p>We generated the quality metrics pipeline iteratively using the set of gathered papers and the descriptive table with quality metrics factors as reference. In particular, (1) we built a first draft of the new pipeline;</p><p>(2) we went through the whole list of papers and checked whether the pipeline was able to describe every aspect involved in the process; (3) where discrepancies were found, we refined the pipeline accordingly. As a final step, we double-checked that every paper in the list could be described by a specific instance of the pipeline. Similarly to the procedure followed in the first phase we let one of the authors, not involved in the model generation phase, again play devil's advocate and refine the model at intermediary steps. The work on the pipeline generated also small adjustments that led to the final version of the quality metrics table <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>.</p><p>It is important to note that while we followed a systematic approach there is no guarantee that this is the only way to describe quality metrics and their use. Many of the elements introduced in the proposed models are the result of our own experience and are thus necessarily subjective. Nonetheless, the usefulness of the proposed model is demonstrated by its ability to describe the whole set of papers and to identify relevant gaps interesting for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">QUALITY METRICS PIPELINE</head><p>We briefly recall the main elements of the Card et al.ś pipeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref> and then we move forward to the description of our extensions.</p><p>The original purpose of the infovis pipeline was to model the main steps required to transform data into interactive visualizations. The quality metrics pipeline in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> preserves its main elements: processing steps (horizontal arrows), stages (boxes), and user feedback (with few naming differences we will explain soon). Data transformation transforms data into the desired format. Visual mapping maps data structures into visual structures (visualization axes, marks, graphical properties). View transformation creates rendered views out of the visual structures. The whole set of transformations is influenced by the user who can decide at any time to transform the data (e.g., filter), use different visual structures and, navigate the visualization through different view points.</p><p>The infovis pipeline captures extremely well the key elements of interactive visualization across a variety of domains and visual techniques. However, when we focus on the visualization of highdimensional data patterns a practical problem arises. While the whole set of processes is still valid, the number of possible combinations at each step is so high that it is impractical to find interactively the most effective ones. An example in the spirit of Mackinlay's seminal analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref> helps to clarify the problem: if the original data has dimensionality n = 10 (still a quite low number) and the number of available visual parameters is k = 4 (e.g., a scatter plot with the following visual primitives: x-axis, y-axis, size, and color), the number of alternative mappings at the visual mapping stage is already more than 5000 (k-permutations, i.e., the number of sequences without repetition: n! (n−k)! ). The main function of quality metrics algorithms is to aid the user in the selection of promising combinations. Typically, the algorithms search through large sets of possibilities and suggest one or more solutions to be evaluated by the user. To describe these steps we created an additional layer in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> that we call quality-metrics-driven automation, which depicts how quality metrics fit into the process. The metrics draw information from the stages of the pipeline (green upwards arrows) and influence the processing steps (blue downwards arrows) with their computation. The user remains in control of the whole process letting the machine perform the computationally hard tasks. We named the new pipeline the quality metrics pipeline.</p><p>The concept of generation of alternatives and their evaluation is at the core of the method. Regardless the purpose, all the systems we have encountered follow a common general pattern:</p><p>1. Create alternatives (projections, mappings, etc.) 2. Evaluate alternatives (rank views, orderings, etc) 3. Produce a final representation (ranked list of views, small multiples, etc.)</p><p>As we will show in Section 6, systems with disparate purposes can be described by this same model.</p><p>Processing. In the following we provide details about specific features of the processing steps of the quality metrics pipeline.</p><p>1. Data Transformation (source data → transformed data). In the original pipeline this step has the main role to put the data in a tabular format, hence the original name tabular data of its output. Since here we focus on high-dimensional data we assume the source data to be already in a tabular format and we rename it into transformed data. At this stage data transformation is responsible for the generation of alternative data subsets or derivations.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4</ref>. Quality metrics pipeline. The pipeline provides an additional layer named quality metrics base automation on top of the traditional information visualization pipeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>. The layer obtains information from the stages of the pipeline (the boxes) and influences the processes of the pipeline through the metrics it calculates. The user is always in control.</p><p>that can again be evaluated in terms of quality metrics. The most common type of operation at this stage is the generation of orderings; by assigning data dimensions to visualization axes in different orders. In general, alternatives can be generated by considering the full set of visual features (e.g., color, size, shape).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Rendering/View Transformation (visual structures → views).</head><p>Rendering transforms visual structures into views by specifying graphical properties that turn these structures into pixels. We added the word Rendering to the pipeline to emphasize the role of the image space; many quality metrics are thus calculated directly in the image space considering the pixels generated in the visualization process. At this stage alternatives views of the same structures can be generated automatically. Surprisingly, as we discuss in Section 7, this stage is, in the context of our inquiry, rarely used.</p><p>Quality metrics computation. Quality metrics can draw information from any of the stages of the pipeline. As we describe later in Subsection 5.1 quality metrics can be calculated in the data space, image space or a combination of the two. Metrics calculated at the View stage draw information from the rendered image, whereas the others draw information from the data space (and elements of the visual structures in some few cases). Many different kind of metrics are possible. Our analysis of quality metrics features in Subsection 5.1 provides numerous additional details.</p><p>Quality metrics influence. As described above, quality metrics algorithms generate alternatives and organize them into a final representation. At the data processing stage they can for instance generate 1D, 2D, or nD projections (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">44]</ref>), data samples (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28]</ref>), or alternative aggregates (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>). At the visual mapping stage the layer generates alternative orderings or mappings between data and visual properties (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">42]</ref>). At the view stage the layer can generate modifications of the current view like changing the point of view, highlighting specific items, or distorting the visual space (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>).</p><p>User influence. The quality metrics layer does not want to substitute the user in favor of the machine. While the users can always influence all the stages of the pipeline, their main responsibility becomes to steer the process, e.g., by setting quality metrics parameters, and to explore the resulting views. It is worth noting that the process is not necessarily a linear flow through the steps. As will be evident from the examples in Section 6 in many cases complex iteration takes place.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS</head><p>Through our paper review we identified two main areas of investigation. First, we classify the papers according to quality metrics criteria that help explaining their key features. Second, we provide a more detailed categorization of the visualization techniques we have come across.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Quality Metrics</head><p>Through the literature review we identified a number of factors that describe the methods encountered. Each factor has a number of possible values and each paper can assume one or more of these values (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>).</p><p>What is measured. This factor describes what is measured by the quality metric. In our analysis we have grouped the metrics in the following categories: Clustering metrics measure the extent to which the visualization or the data contain groupings, that is, well-separated clusters that can be easily identified. Clustering is loosely defined because we have encountered many alternative approaches. It is worth to keep in mind that with clustering here we intend any measure in the data or image space which is able to capture groupings. Correlation relates to two or more data dimensions and captures the extent to which systematic changes to one dimension are accompanied by changes in other dimensions. Simple Pearson correlation between two variables is one of the most commonly used measure in this category but global correlation among multiple data dimensions are also used <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>. Outlier metrics capture the extent to which the data segment under inspection contains elements that behave differently from the large majority of the data, i.e., outliers. Complex patterns metrics capture aspects that cannot be easily categorized as any of the classes described above. We detected a number of papers with such measures and grouped all of them in this class. An example is Graph-Theoretic Scagnostics [54] a technique where it is possible to characterize scatter plots with features like "stringy" or "skinny". Image quality refers to metrics where the purpose is not necessarily to find specific patterns but more to identify the degree of organization of a visualization or, as some of the papers call it, the amount of clutter. Feature preservation metrics focus on the comparison between a reference state and the representation in the visualization, or between the features in the data and the visualization, with the intent to preserve the features of interest as much as possible. A subset of these papers focus on classified data, searching for projections where the original classes are well separated <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">48]</ref>. In the same category we can find papers that measure the information loss due to data abstraction techniques such as sampling and aggregation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28]</ref>. It is worth noticing that in this categorization we classified the techniques according to their main target. This however does not hinder a metric of one type to also detect patterns of another type. For instance, clustering and correlation, as well as complex patterns and image quality, may have such an overlap.</p><p>Where it is measured (data/image space). In our review we have found a completely mixed set of approaches with respect to where the metrics are calculated: data space or image space. Metrics calculated in data space detect data features directly in the data without using information from the view that will be used to display the results. For instance, the Rank-by-Feature technique ranks 1D and 2D projections according to a number of statistical properties calculated only in data space. Metrics calculated in image space bypass the analysis of the data and work directly on the rendered image. Often these methods employ sophisticated image processing techniques like in the work of  <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref>. A mixed-space approach, where both data and and image space are used at the same time, is also possible. We found two distinct cases. Bertini and Santucci <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref> present a measure to compare features in the data space to features in the image space; with the intent of preserving as much as possible data features in the final image. Peng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref> measure clutter in relation to the ordering of visualization axes: these calculations need data features (outliers, correlations) and visualization features (e.g., axes adjacency) at the same time. Please note that the entries in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, where both data and image space are present, do not necessarily imply the use of the aforementioned mixed approach. More often, they simply mean that alternative approaches co-exist in the context of the same paper.</p><p>Purpose. Purpose describes the main reason for using quality metrics, that is, what is the goal to be achieved with the metric. We identified the following purposes. Projection aims at finding subsets of the original dimensions in which interesting patterns reside, e.g., analyzing all the possible 2D projections of a multidimensional data set by checking whether interesting groupings exist in a scatter plot. Ordering aims at finding, where possible, an ordering of the visualization axes that eases the visual detection of interesting patterns. Parallel coordinates is a classical example where the order of the axes greatly influences the chances of detecting interesting patterns in the data. Abstraction aims at maintaining or controlling a certain degree of data representation quality when data reduction techniques are used to increase the scalability of a visualization. Sampling and aggregation are the two main types of abstraction techniques we encountered. For instance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref> the authors propose a data abstraction technique that permits to measure the information loss due to abstraction and to find a trade-off between data loss and data reduction. Visual mapping aims at finding interesting mappings between the original data features and the visual features of the visualization technique. Features such as color, size or shape fall into this category. View optimization aims at modifying parameters of the view with the intent to produce better visualizations, in which, for example, data segments with a high degree of interest are highlighted.</p><p>Interaction. The last column of the table indicates which papers offer the possibility to interact with the quality-metrics-based automation. We extracted two main classes of interaction: threshold selection and metrics selection. With threshold selection we mean the possibility to set thresholds in the quality metrics computation mechanism (e.g., the data abstraction level in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref> or the density estimation smoothing parameter in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>). With metrics selection we mean systems in which the user can either switch from one metrics to another or combine them into an integrated one (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">30]</ref>). Please note that some of the papers may contain interaction capabilities and still be marked as not interactive because they do not provide direct interaction with the quality metrics mechanisms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Visualization</head><p>The original table we have designed to classify the full set of papers (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> below) contains a rough categorization of visualization techniques into three main classes: scatter plots (SP), parallel coordinates (PC) and others (which include a fairly large number of different techniques). While this categorization helps understanding how these techniques distribute over the whole set of papers (SP and PC accounts for 80% of the total) it does not say anything about key features of visualization techniques; especially those closely related to the usage of quality metrics.</p><p>We define layout dimensionality as the number of data axes a visualization has. A data axis is the visualization feature that establishes what position a single visual mark takes in the visualization. For instance, scatter plots have dimensionality two because they can accommodate two spatial dimensions.</p><p>The visualization techniques are classified into 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D and nD, where nD stands for techniques that can accommodate an arbitrary number of dimensions (with obvious scalability limits when the number of dimensions grows too big).</p><p>It is worth noticing that in general every visualization has an addi-tional number of visual features to which data features can be mapped, e.g., color and size, but here we focus on the layout because it is the variable that most characterizes every visualization technique and that has the biggest impact on the use of quality metrics. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the dimensionality of all the techniques we have identified in the review. The visualization techniques that are not in the nD class necessarily need an additional mechanism for the analysis of high-dimensional data. Typically, as discussed below, they are organized in a higher level structure that accommodates several projections. Those which can accommodate an arbitrary number of dimensions (nD) all need some kind of ordering mechanisms. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Visualization techniques categorized by their layout dimensionality (i.e., the number of axes of the visualization).</p></div>

With metavisualization we mean a visualization of visualizations. More specifically, a visualization layout strategy that organizes single visualizations into an organized form. For instance, when a quality-metricsdriven technique produces a number of interesting scatter plots as an output, there is the need to organize them into a schema that facilitates their comprehension and analysis (e.g., organized into a list sorted by interestingness). From our analysis we have identified the following main meta-visualization strategies. List: a layout strategy that organizes visualizations in an ordered linear fashion (often sorted to reflect quality metrics rankings). Matrix: a layout strategy that organizes visualizations in a grid format, where grid entries are organized according to some data features (e.g., column and rows represent data dimensions) (often called also Small Multiples, Trellis, Lattice, Facets).</p><p>It is worth noticing that some basic visualization techniques can be considered meta-visualizations themselves. A notable example is the scatter plot matrix which shows a set of scatter plots organized in a matrix layout.</p><p>In general there is a strong interplay between visualizations and meta-visualizations. As mentioned above, techniques with a fixed dimensionality need to be organized in a meta-visualization. The metavisualization influences the ordering of the visualizations and in some cases also the content. For instance, the matrix layout requires that the visualization within a grid cell corresponds to the data values it represents.</p><p>Finally, meta-visualizations can themselves be influenced by quality metrics. All the layout strategies have some degree of freedom in terms of reordering, and an optimal reordering (according to some given goal) can only be achieved by searching in the space of solutions (e.g., as presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>).</p></div>

We selected the examples in a way to cover as many interesting aspects as possible. In particular, we picked papers <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Quality metrics papers classified according to quality metrics factors (sorted by purpose).  with different purposes because they guarantee a larger variety of features. The first example comes from the work of Tatu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref>. The main goal of this paper is to find interesting projections of n-dimensional data using image processing techniques. The paper contains several measures and visualization techniques, here we focus only on the part dealing with parallel coordinates and one specific metric.</p></div>

This adaptive threshold is not only necessary to select possible line clusters in the accumulator space, but also to avoid the influence of outliers and occlusion between the lines. In the occlusion case, a point that belongs to two or more lines is computed just once in the accumulator space. The final goodness value for a 2D visualization is due to the number of accumulator cells n cells that have a higher value than m normalized by the total number of cells (wḣ) to the interval [0, 1]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">s i, j = 1 − n cells wh ,<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where i, j are the indices of the respective dimensions, and the computed measure s i, j presents higher values for images containing well defined line clusters (similar lines) and lower values for images containing lines in many different directions and positions. Having combined the pairwise visualizations, we can now compute the overall quality measure by summing up the respective pairwise measurements. This overall quality measure of a parallel visualization containing n dimensions is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">HSM = ∑ a i ∈I s a i ,a i+1 ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where I is a vector containing any possible combination of the n dimensions indices. In this way we can measure the quality of any given visualization, using Parallel Coordinates. Exhaustively computing all n-dimensional combinations in order to choose the best/worst ones, requires a very long computation time and becomes unfeasible for a large n. In these cases, in order to search for the best n-dimensional combinations in a feasible time, an algorithm to solve a Traveling Salesman Problem is used, e.g. the A*-Search algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref> or others <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>. Instead of exhaus-separately observed and that contain less overlapping are als considered to be good. We developed two measures for classifie Parallel Coordinates that take these matters into account: th Similarity Measure that encourages inner class similarities, and th Overlap Measure that analyzes the overlap between classes. Bot are based on the measure for unclassified data presented in sectio 5.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">Similarity Measure</head><p>The similarity measure is a direct extension of the measure pre sented in section 5.1. For visualizations containing class informa tion, the different classes are usually represented by different co ors. We separate the classes into distinct images, containing onl the pixels in the respective class color, and compute a quality mea sure s k for each class, using equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(14)</ref>. Thereafter, an overa quality value s is computed as the sum of all class quality measure</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">SM = ∑ k s k .<label>(16</label></formula><p>Using this measure, we encourage visualizations with strong inne class similarities and slightly penalize overlapped classes. Note th due to the classes overlap, some classes have many missing pixel which results in a lower s k value compared to other visualization where less or no overlap between the classes exists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">Overlap Measure</head><p>In order to penalize overlap between classes, we analyze the diffe ence between the classes in the Hough space (see section 5.1). As i the similarity measure, we separate the classes to different image and compute the Hough transform over each image. Once we hav a Hough space h for each class, we compute the quality measure a the sum of the absolute difference between the classes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">OM = M−1 ∑ k=1 M ∑ l=k+1 P ∑ i=1 ||h i k − h i l || (17</formula><p>Here M is the number of Hough space images, i.e. classes respec tively and P is the number of pixels. This value is high if th Hough spaces are disjoint, i.e. if there is no large overlap betwee the classes. Therefore, the visualization with the smallest overla between the classes receives the highest values. Another interesting use of this measure is to encourage or searc for similarities between different classes. In this case, the overla between the classes is desired, and the previously computed mea sure can be inverted to compute suitable quality values:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">OM INV = 1/OM. (18</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">APPLICATION AND EVALUATION</head><p>We tested our measures on a variety of real datasets. We applie our Class Density Measure (CDM), Histogram Density Measur (HDM), Similarity Measure (SM) and Overlap Measure (OM) o classified data, to find views on the data which try to either separa the data or show similarities between the classes. For unclassifie data, we applied our Rotating Variance Measure (RVM) and Houg Space Measure (HSM) in order to find linear or non-linear correla The basic idea of the method is to generate all possible 2D combinations of the original dimensions and evaluate them in terms of their ability to form clusters in a 2-axis parallel coordinates representation (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>). Every pair of axis is evaluated individually using a standard image processing technique (the Hough transform), which permits to discriminate between uniform and chaotic distributions of line angles and positions (for details please refer to the original paper). Once interesting pairs have been extracted, they are joined together to form groups of parallel coordinates of a desired (user-defined) size (e.g., in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>, groups of 4-dimensional parallel coordinates).   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref> presents the pipeline for this example. We can recognize three main elements: (A) all 2D parallel coordinates are generated in the data transformation phase; (B) all the alternatives are evaluated in the image space at the view stage; (C) the algorithm combines the interesting segments into a list of parallel coordinates (like those in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>) using the visual mapping stage. The technique uses parallel coordinates (PC) as principal visualization technique and a list as a meta-visualization. It measures clustering properties, in the image space, and its main purpose is to find interest-ing projections. Interaction, in the way it is discussed in the paper, is very limited if not absent.</p><p>The second example comes from the work of Johansson and Johansson on interactive feature selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>. The technique ranks every single dimension for its importance using a combination of correlation, outlier, and clustering features calculated on the data. This ranking is used as the basis for an interactive threshold selection tool by which the user can decide how many dimensions to keep; weighting the choice with the corresponding information loss presented by the chart (see <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). Once the user selects the desired number of dimensions the system presents the result with parallel coordinates and automatically finds a good ordering using the same data features calculated for ranking the dimensions. The user can also choose different weighting schemes to focus more on correlation, outliers or clusters. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref> shows the results of clustering (top) and correlation (bottom). sum of I( x j) for the removed variables and I total is the sum of I( x j) for all variables in the data set.</p><p>The interactive display (figure 4) consists of a line graph and a graphical user interface for modification of weight values and selection of number of variables to keep. The line graph displays the relationship between I lost (y-axis) and number of variables to keep in the reduced data set (x-axis), representing each quality metric individually by a line and using one line for the combined importance value of all metrics. A similar approach is taken in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref>, where quality measures for data abstractions such as clustering and sampling are integrated into multivariate visualizations. A vertical line is used in the interactive display to facilitate identification of lost information for the selected number of variables. If retaining 18 variables, according to the position of the vertical line in figure 4, it can be seen from the display that some of the retained variables contain no cluster information at all. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">figure 6</ref> the corresponding 18 variable data set is visualized using parallel coordinates. As can be seen from the visual aids at the bottom of the axes, the five left variables are of low global importance and also have low cluster and correlation importance. By looking at the patterns of the lines it is also quite easily seen that these variables are rather noisy, hence more variables can be removed from the data set without losing much more information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Variable Ordering</head><p>The order of variables in multivariate visualization has a large impact on how easily we can perceive different structures in the data. The proposed system combines several quality metrics to find a dimensionality reduction that can be regarded as a good representation of the original data set, focusing on the structures that are of interest for the particular analysis task at hand. Finding one appropriate variable ordering enhancing all interesting structures at once may, however, be unrealistic since enhancement of some structures obstructs enhancement of others. An aim of the system is to provide the user with good visual representations of the reduced data set by enhancing the existing structures within the data. The ordering of variables in the system has been approached by supplying a selection of automatic orderings, each enhancing the structures of an individual quality metric. The user can interactively switch between different variable orderings and to enable comparison of different variable orders multiple displays are used.</p><p>Within this paper three quality metrics are discussed, correlation, outliers and clusters. The variable ordering focusing on correlation is inspired by the variable ordering described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>. In connection to the correlation analysis in the initial phase of the dimensionality reduction, information on the correlation of variable pairs is computed. When the variables of the reduced data set are to be ordered, the variable pair, xa x b , with the highest correlation within this data set is identified. </p></div>

A kdimensional unit is considered dense if its density is higher than the thresholds of all one-dimensional units of which it is composed. Within the proposed system the clustering algorithm has been slightly modified to further speed-up the cluster detection by using a variable removal approach inspired by the retaining of 'interesting' subspaces in <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The goal of the cluster analysis in the system is to identify variables with high importance for cluster structures. Due to this only variables with high cluster coverage are of interest. Hence, units belonging to variables where only a small number of items are part of a cluster are removed from further analysis. Furthermore the maximum dimensionality of clusters is limited using a dimensionality threshold, ξ . The creation of candidate dense units iterates until no more candidate units can be extracted or until k = ξ . The maximum cluster dimensionality is defined by the user, who can also control the cluster dominance factor α. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref> an α-value above 1.5 is said to be  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows the pipeline for this example. Again we have three main elements: (A) every single dimension is ranked by the quality metrics directly from the source data. The reason why the source data is needed is because the importance measure of a single dimension is computed taking into account the full set of dimensions (see the paper for details); (B) the user selects the dimensions guided by the quality metrics, both the user and the quality metric influence the data transformation process; (C) the system finds the best ordering according to the weighting scheme proposed by the user producing one specific visual mapping. The view is presented to the user.</p><p>This technique uses parallel coordinates as principal visualization. There is no meta-visualization to organize alternative results in a schema but the interactive chart functions as a way to pilot the generation of alternatives. It measures clustering, correlation and outliers in the data space and its main purpose is to find interesting projections and orderings. Interaction plays a central role in the selection of the number of dimensions and in the weighting scheme.</p><p>The third example is taken from the work of Cui et al. on data abstraction quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>. This paper proposes a technique to create abstracted visualizations in a user-controlled manner. The system features data abstraction metrics (Histogram Difference Measure and Nearest Neighbor Measure) and controllers to let the user find a tradeoff between abstraction level and information loss. In particular, the data abstraction quality is calculated by comparing features of the original data to features in the sampled or aggregated data.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>. ur (see oximate contour the abn adjust see (e)) ge hanegion in region terface, while specific to hierarchically clustered data, can support all of the interactions on the abstraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CASE STUDY 1: CHOOSING A DATA ABSTRACTION LEVEL (DAL)</head><p>In this section, we show how to choose an appropriate DAL. At this level, the abstracted dataset should have high data abstraction quality (equal or more than 0.90) and the visualization should have the best visual quality under the constraints of the data abstraction quality. The analytic task is to search for clusters in the OUT5D dataset. This dataset consists of five remote sensing channels: SPOT, Magnetics, Potassium, Thorium and Uranium, with 16384 records. We employ scatterplots to visualize this dataset. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> shows the original dataset. Data points have significant overlaps with each other and so we cannot distinguish relative data density in different regions and have difficulty observing any trends within this dataset. First we make an abstraction with the DAL equal to 0.02. The corresponding HDM is 0.92 and the NNM is 0.93; this abstraction quality meets our requirements. The abstraction quality is positively related to the data abstraction level in general, although small fluctuations may exist. The scatterplot matrix with DAL equal to 0.02 is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5;</ref> we can see that a cluster (named Cluster A) exists in the marked scatterplot, but data points in other places are too sparse to observe definitive clustering behavior. Next we will focus on searching for a visualization with the best visual quality.</p><p>We change the DAL to 0.08. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>, the sparse region in the marked scatterplot illustrates very good visual quality. However, data points in Cluster A are overplotted, thus the actual relative data density in Cluster A is higher than the relative data density we observe. Next we adjust the DAL to 0.04. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref>, the visual quality in the marked scatterplot is very good while the relative data density is maintained, although a small number of data points in Cluster A still overlap with each other. The quality measures of this abstraction are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. This quality meets our requirement and we terminate our exploration.</p><p>Abstraction quality measures give us confidence in the pattern we discovered. If we only know that the DAL, the ratio between the number of abstracted records and the number of original records, is 0.04, we cannot have much confidence in our discoveries because we know that 96 percent of the data are not shown. However, with the HDM more than 0.95 and the NNM more than 0.96 for both clustering and sampling, we are fairly certain that the abstracted dataset represents the original dataset very well and that the pattern (Cluster A in this case) is very likely valid. In general, we can assign the abstraction quality measures to the discovered pattern to indicate the confidence level of the pattern, which enables analysts to make more accurate decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CASE STUDY 2: COMPARING DATA ABSTRACTION METH-ODS</head><p>In this application, two data abstraction methods, clustering and sampling, are compared using the proposed data abstraction measures embedded within our multiresolution visualization system. We employ the AAUP dataset, which surveys the number, salary and compensation of professors at 1161 institutions. We use parallel coordinates to visualize this dataset. Through this case study, we find that sampling has the advantage of maintaining the relative density of datasets while clustering has the advantage of maintaining the outliers of the dataset.</p><p>First we briefly review some characteristics of the HDM and NNM. The HDM is based on the histogram and minimizes the difference between the distributions of two datasets, so it excels in detecting changes in the relative density of data. The NNM minimizes the distance between the original dataset and the abstracted dataset. Outliers cannot be eliminated during abstraction without the increase of the average distance, because they tend to be far from most of the data records. Thus the NNM method gives high priority to outliers and is good at monitoring the change of outliers. The original dataset is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref>. On the last dimension, the dense range with low values is marked as A and highlighted with red color; the sparse range is marked as B and drawn with green color. We can see that most of the data records are gathered in range A. We sample the original dataset and tentatively set the DAL to 0.08. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  10</ref> shows the visualization of this abstraction. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12a</ref> shows the data abstraction quality of the whole dataset: HDM is 0.90 and NNM is 0.95. We then cluster this dataset, and also set the DAL to 0.08 to 714 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref>. Visual abstraction of a scatter plot matrix from <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> shows the pipeline for this example. We have two main elements: (A) the data abstraction quality measures are calculated by comparing the source data to the transformed data; (B) the user selects the desired abstraction quality and receives feedback on its quality by steering the data transformation process. The paper applies the technique to scatter plots and parallel coordinates but it is generic enough to be applied to many other techniques. There is no meta-visualization to organize alternative results but similarly to the second example an interactive chart is used to set an abstraction threshold (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>). It measures feature preservation, and its main purpose is abstraction. Interaction plays a central role in the selection of the right abstraction level.</p><p>These three examples cover many aspects discussed in the paper, especially metrics calculated in the data vs. image space, different purposes, different measure types, different uses of the pipeline, and different interaction levels. Many of the papers we have reviewed have similar elements and functions, nonetheless there are others that deviate considerably from these ones. While we cannot provide the full set of examples in the scope of this paper we discuss in Section 7 some findings that stem from the analysis of the whole set, including those with uncommon approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">FINDINGS</head><p>In the following we discuss some major trends we have observed during our analysis.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">MSE = ∑ N i=1 ∑ M j=1 (F(i, j) −F(i, j)) 2 NM<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where MSE is the mean squared error, F(i, j) is the pixel value at (i, j) in the original image,F(i, j) is the pixel value at (i, j) in the compressed image, and M and N are the length and height of the image.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">PSBR = 10 log 10 ( MAX 2 I MSE )<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where PSBR is the peak signal-to-noise ratio and MAXI is the maximum pixel value. As we can see, the NNM employs the same method to compute the average distance between two datasets. The only difference is that they employ different methods to process the average distance to get the measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">INTEGRATING QUALITY MEASURES WITH MULTIRESOLU-TION VISUALIZATION</head><p>In this section, we describe our work on integrating quality measures into XmdvTool to develop effective and abstraction-aware multiresolution visualization. First we describe the interaction tool that we use to display quality measures. Then we present the interactive operations we support for quality measures. Next, we discuss the view continuity problem of sampling, and finally we give an overview of the Structure-Based Brush (SBB) we use to control abstraction parameters in clustering data. Analysts can adjust the DAL of clustering through both the general widget for all abstraction methods and the SBB, while they can only brush the structure formed by clustering through the SBB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Displaying Measures</head><p>XmdvTool supports interactive selection via brushing <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16]</ref> using a rich assortment of tools. The data selected through brushing is called the selected data, while the remaining data are called the unselected data. Analysts can adjust the DAL for the selected data as well as the unselected data. Each view of the data generates several quality measures. We use bar charts to display them. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows two such bar charts, the left one conveys the quality measures for the selected data, and the right one conveys the quality measures for the unselected data. These charts only illustrate the quality measures at a single DAL. We use 1D plots to illustrate quality measures and their relationship to the DAL. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, the left and right plot show the quality measures for the selected and unselected regions, respectively. In each plot, the sponding measures of this abstraction level. The DAL and measures are displayed to the right of the DAL handle. With these plots, analysts can know the quality of the current DAL in the context of the entire quality space. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Interactive Operations</head><p>Several interactive operations are supported in this system. Users can move the slider bar in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> or the DAL handle in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> to adjust the data abstraction level. After the DAL has been changed, the system will generate an abstracted dataset and display it in the data visualization. The DALs for selected and unselected data can be adjusted independently. Users can also modify the location of one of the boundaries of the selected region by clicking the left mouse button on or near the boundary and dragging in the desired direction. In addition, the selected region can be moved by choosing a region on the data display, and then adjusting the DAL for the region. This usually means that the user knows the data subset that she wants to explore and wants to take advantage of the scalability of multiresolution visualization. Alternatively a user can first choose a DAL in the current selected region, and then adjust the selected/brushing boundary to enlarge or diminish the size of the region. This usually means that an acceptable data abstraction level had been found, but the area of interest needs to be increased or decreased.</p><p>Analysts can also instruct the system to run the abstraction algorithm again to generate a new abstraction. For example, resampling can help analysts verify patterns that had been discovered in the previous samples. If a pattern still exists after resampling several times, this pattern is most likely a robust one. Furthermore, analysts can compare the abstraction measures from mutiple resampling, and select an abstraction with best quality. Finally, a user can indicate a desired quality level based on one of the measures and let the system decide the appropriate DAL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">View Continuity for Sampling</head><p>When analysts change the DAL, the patterns in the previous sample can be more easily remembered and compared with those in the current sample if view continuity is maintained. This can be accomplished by following the three guidelines below: 1. When changing from a low DAL to a higher DAL, all the records in the previous sample should be kept. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 13</ref>. Visual abstraction chart with threshold setting for the abstraction level and feedback on abstraction quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>.</p><p>From the visualization point of view we already discussed the role of meta-visualizations, that is, visualizations with the purpose to accommodate other visualizations. During the paper review we found very limited explicit discussions of this aspect which we deem extremely relevant. Many of the papers we have analyzed seem to assume that providing a simple list of interesting visualizations will automatically solve the user's task. To the best of our knowledge, the only work that analyzes the issue explicitly and in great depth is the Trellis display <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref>, which organizes the display in a way to make patterns among views apparent. We believe a deeper investigation of this issue is needed.</p><p>Interestingly, some of the papers we reviewed do take care of the navigation issue, that is, how to explore configurations automatically found by the algorithm. These papers usually provide an additional visualization that permits to navigate from one configuration to another. For instance, Johansson et al. provide a line chart visualization to interactively show alternative projections in parallel coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>. Similarly, "hierarchical dimension ordering" <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref> uses the InterRing visualization to the let the user navigate through alternative subsets of dimensions organized in a hierarchical fashion. Finally, the Rank-by-Feature framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref> uses color-coded interactive lists and scatter plot matrices to provide a preview of the statistical properties of each views.</p><p>We also noticed a lack of systematic approaches to the ordering problem; every paper proposes its own method. The whole topic of seriation, introduced in the early work of Bertin <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref> and discussed in depth by Hahsler et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>, deserves deeper investigation and acknowledgment. Also, innovative ways of ordering data dimensions may exist, like the eulerian tours and hamiltonian decompositions presented by Hurley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>, which explores the possibility of repeating the axes in order to reduce dependency on a specific order.</p><p>In Subsection 5.2 we list a series of meta-visualizations that we have found, namely list, small multiples, and matrix. We believe this list can be expanded if novel solutions are developed. A promising one we have noticed in a few papers, but not included in the review (because they are not specifically using quality metrics) is the idea of arranging iconic versions of the visualizations generated in a scatter plot view (e.g., using MDS or similar techniques). Such a technique is for instance proposed in the work of Yang et al. where pixel-based icons are laid out with an MDS projection in a scatter plot <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57]</ref>.</p><p>Another issue we noticed from our analysis is the limited use of the visual mapping and view transformation functions in the pipeline. More specifically, visual mapping is almost exclusively used as a way to generate alternative orderings, taking into account exclusively the mapping between the original data dimensions and the visualization axes. But alternative mappings can also be generated by linking data dimensions to the whole spectrum of visual features like color, size, shape, etc., as is common in several systems based on visual languages like ggplot2[1], tableau <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>, and protovis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>). Pixnostics <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref> is the only technique in our review presenting this kind of a process supported by quality metrics.</p><p>View transformation is also rarely used in the quality metrics pipeline. The only example we found is the use of quality metrics to automatically select focus area parameters in table lens <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>. The automatic selection of interesting point of views in 3D scatter plots, for example, is one clear case where the use of quality metrics at the view transformation stage would be beneficial. Another one is the automatic highlight of interesting items in a view (e.g., visual boosting in pixel-based visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref>).</p><p>Finally, the purposes we have considered can be roughly classified into two broad higher level purposes: finding interesting visualizations and scaling visualizations to larger data sets. When considering these goals it is evident how clustering, correlation, outliers, and complex patterns support more the first goal, whereas image quality and feature preservation tend to support more the second one. One interesting pending issue is whether the use of quality metrics in high-dimensional data is confined to these two general purposes. One purpose which to the best of our knowledge is totally unexplored is the use of quality metrics to automatically or semi-automatically compare different visual techniques of the same data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">FILLING THE GAPS: A RESEARCH AGENDA</head><p>In the following we present a selected set of research issues we deem important for the advancement of quality-metrics-driven data visualization.</p><p>Evaluation and applications. Surprisingly, none of the papers we have analyzed reported on user evaluation. While we are convinced that quality metrics are useful and need to be further developed, we also realize that the whole idea has not yet been tested. Usefulness is therefore one of the most important aspect to consider, followed by usability issues. To the best of our knowledge there are no studies reporting on the use of the quality metrics approach in real-world settings. Observatory studies or even simple case studies would greatly improve the approach and most likely direct research to specific issues hard to anticipate without observation.</p><p>Perceptual tuning. All the metrics that work in the image space try to simulate the human pattern recognition machinery to some extend. They try to partially substitute human vision with image processing algorithms with the (implicit) assumption that algorithm rankings will match user rankings. This assumption needs a much deeper investigation. The study presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref>, where quality metrics rankings of clusters in scatter plots are compared to human rankings, represents a first step in this direction. In addition, it is necessary to validate and tune the image space metrics in a way that the parameters take models of human perception into account. Excellent examples of initial steps in this direction are in the following papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">41]</ref>, where the perception of visual patterns has been tuned according to user studies aimed at modeling the way humans perceive them.</p><p>Metrics systematization. During our review we collected a very large number of alternative quality metrics, some calculated in data space some in image space. While this proliferation of metrics is a sign of the richness of this approach, it is currently very hard to compare them and understand which one is suitable for a given task. Some authors provide a number of metrics in the same environment letting the user choose which one to use. Nonetheless we fear that this approach with limited guidance may not be effective for end users, especially, if there is a lack of understanding of the level of redundancy between one metric and another. Similarly, given the above mentioned dichotomy, it is hard if not impossible to state which approach yields the best results in which contexts. On a side note, the mixed approach of giving the user the possibility to combine several metrics into a composite one need much more investigation, validation, and guidance.</p><p>Scalability. Image space and data space quality metrics have different scalability issues. Quality metrics in image space have the advantage of being independent from the original data size, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>, that is, their computational complexity only depends on the screen dimensions. However, as data grows in size, virtually all visualizations experience some degrees of degradation that may influence the discriminatory power of the metric. For instance, visualizations with a lot of clutter might hinder the discovery of the desired patterns. Quality metrics in data space, on the other hand, are expected to be more robust in terms of pattern detection, but their computation is directly affected by data size. A thorough investigation of these issues and how to find a compromise between the two is clearly an interesting subject for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">LIMITATIONS</head><p>Our work has some important limitations to take into account; first of all its subjective nature. We are by no means suggesting this is the only way to describe the current state of quality metrics in high-dimensional visualization. There are no doubt a number of equally good alternative ways to describe it; this paper provides a much-needed starting point. We encourage the reader to use the paper as a way to get inspiration for further research and to understand its status.</p><p>Similarly, while we did our best to follow a thorough methodology (see Section 3), there might be relevant papers we overlooked. Even though we tried to be very broad and inclusive, the review is heavily influenced by our background. Especially, given our focus on Computer Science we might have missed relevant literature from Statistics. However, we feel confident that at this point of our review any additional paper would not change the structure or the elements of our model. In other terms, the real goal of our review was not to include every possible paper on the discussed matter but more to have enough coverage to build a coherent and useful picture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">CONCLUSION</head><p>We presented a systematic analysis of quality metrics as a way to support the exploration of high-dimensional data sets. Quality metrics have been used in a variety of contexts and purposes. With this work we started a collection of these disparate systems under one umbrella and provided a way to reason about their characteristic features. Specifically, we presented an analysis of the visualization techniques, the quality metrics, and the processing pipeline. The analysis has two main outcomes. First, it permits to describe the methods in details to capture their key components. Second, as shown in Section 7 and Section 8, it permits to spot interesting research gaps and promising directions for future research. While we consider this work just an initial step, we hope it will spur new ideas and support researchers and practitioners in the development of interesting new applications and novel techniques.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Ranking projections according to their class density measure, favoring projections with minimal overlap between predefined classes (i.e., the colors)<ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref>.Example 1.

Well ned clusters in the dataset are favored. Bottom row: The three worst ranked visualizations. The large amount of spread exacerbates rpretation. Note that the user task related to this measure is not to find possible correlation between the dimensions but to detect good arated clusters.re 10: Results for the Cars dataset. Cars using benzine are shown in black, diesel in red. Best and worst ranked visualizations using Hough similarity measure (Section 5.2.1) for Parallel Coordinates. (a) Top row: The three best ranked visualizations and their respective alized measures. Bottom row: The three worst ranked visualizations.g our overlap measure (Section 5.2.1) for Parallel Coordinates. (a) Top row: The three best ranked visualizations. Despite good similarity, h are similar to clusters, visualizations are favored that minimize the overlap between the classes, so the difference between malign and ign cells becomes more clear. Bottom row: The three worst ranked visualizations. The overlap of the data complicates the analysis, the rmation is useless for the task of discriminating malign and benign cells.</note></figure>
