<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Online news sources publish news that report on real-world events of different importance. The data is generated at non-equidistant time intervals, making it different from other time series data, such as any type of measurement data, which is sampled at fixed time intervals. Each data item in news streams carries valuable information in both its timestamp and its content. On the other hand, when these virtual events come from different sources, but are related to the same realworld event, they create sequences (event episodes) that differ in importance based on their volume and time density. This dual nature of such event-based data creates significant challenges for its analysis.</p><p>In the last years a lot of research has been conducted on time series representations. One of the lines in research is how to deal with recent data, which has more importance than the data that was acquired before, and how to put the incoming data in the context of the past. Also, in many applications, there is a need to have direct access to individual data items in multiple time series. However, time series datasets are often very long, and the amount of data makes analysis of individual data items very difficult. Usually, data is either aggregated or sampled to reduce overplotting, thus leading to the loss of information. Besides using automated algorithms for analysis, such as pattern detection or measuring similarity, many tasks could be more efficiently solved by using interactive visualization tools that would include the analyst at different stages of the exploration process.</p><p>Another important aspect of today's time series data is that it usually comes in dynamic information streams, which puts additional constraints for visual representation of such data. The visualization has to be incrementally updated, without distracting the user and his understanding of the data that he is working with. In many applications, such as the analysis of news, network traffic or financial data, concurrent analysis of multiple series is needed, which allow the analyst to make sense about ongoing relationships between the different categories of time series data. Limited screen space makes this type of analysis difficult. While some research has been conducted on visual Step-by-step construction of a single CloudLine. (top) A sequence of event data on a linear timeline, where each event is represented by a circle. It is practically impossible to distinguish between the high and low density areas.(middle) The same sequence after mapping the importance function to opacity of each circle. Importance function is described in Section 4. The change in opacity levels shows the structure of the sequence better. However, overplotting and the fact that maximum opacity can be reached very quickly don't allow for finer details in high density areas to be shown. (bottom) Importance function mapped to both opacity and size of the circles. Several event episodes can be identified much more easily.</p><p>representations that would allow the user to explore the low level details of interest within long time series, to the best of our knowledge there is little work that deals with multiple time series event data.</p><p>To address these issues we developed CloudLines, a technique for interactive visual analysis of multiple time series event data. We use timeline distortion techniques to accommodate more space for recent data for interaction with individual data items. At the same time, we employ Focus+Context approach to allow inspection of data points in highly compressed areas. While giving direct access to individual data points (events), our technique also allows quick detection of event episodes, i.e. high density sequences of events.</p><p>In this paper we describe the following contributions:</p><p>• A compact visualization for time series event data, which: 1) takes into account the distribution of the data points, 2) shows recent data with minimal overlap, and 3) allows easy detection of important event episodes.</p><p>• A lens-based interaction for direct access to overlapping events.</p><p>• Demonstration of the approach by applying it to multiple time series acquired from the real-world news streams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</head><p>In this paper, we are addressing the problem of designing a compact display for multiple event-based long time series data, which would provide global overview of the whole dataset and allow atomic analysis of individual events. Besides the fact that the limited screen real estate causes high overlapping of these data, we are also addressing the problem of putting the more relevant recent data in the context of the past. Our space-efficient solution helps in comparing multiple time series at once, while it can also be used for displaying single time series when vertical space is limited (for example, on the screens of mobile devices).</p><p>Data . We're working with events, i.e. time-stamped data points that arrive in data streams at non-equidistant time intervals. The changing rate at which the events arrive creates new data processing and visualization challenges, which usually do not exist when working with streaming data that comes in at regular intervals, such as any type of measurement data. Additionally, each event contains not just a numerical value, but is rich in content, providing meta information that is of great interest for the user. Therefore, it is important to allow direct interaction with events on the atomic level. Events can belong to different categories, or we can acquire different event data streams for which simultaneous analysis is needed. Since our timestamps are not equidistant, sequences of events that are close in time can be defined as event episodes. These high density areas are of great importance, because they show important local features of the event data stream. On the other hand, low density areas could be under certain conditions regarded as noise.</p></div>

The use of animation for transitions in time series can be found in the taxonomy by Heer and Robertson <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DESIGN</head><p>When recent events have higher importance, we allow logarithmic distortion of the timeline to provide easy access to these events while keeping an informative context of the past. Each event (data item) is displayed as a circle of minimum object size for visibility and interaction. Circular objects allow better distinction than rectangular in case of slight overlap. Logarithmic timeline allows for smooth transition within the distorted display space, while other approaches that deal with space partitioning were proposed in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Let's take a naive approach. Linear scaling of one month of event data without overlapping and aggregation on a 1,200 pixels wide display, with event object width of 5 pixels, would allow a total of 240 events. With 1 pixel not overlapping this number could go up to 1,200, thus creating a line of indistinguishable event data. By using object transparency this number could theoretically go up to 120,000 (assuming that each object is shown at 1% of full opacity). However, this hypothetical example would make individual item inspection completely meaningless. Besides, this would mean around 40 pixels for each day for one month of data, which is less than 2 pixels per hour.</p><p>By giving more space for recent data, and compressing the past, under the same circumstances, we provide much more space for the inspection of individual data items in the present, while creating high compression of the data in the past.</p><p>Event episode as visual cluster. In a less radical scenario, where the ratio of available space to observed time window of interest is more favourable and the distortion of the time axis is not needed, our visualization can allow the user to easily distinguish between areas with high density (event episodes) and areas with low density. Typically, detection of event episodes can be solved by combining data aggregation and different visualization techniques, e.g. by plotting frequencies at discrete time points, interpolation and stacking <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> or histogram and cubic spline interpolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. However, these ap-proaches display pre-calculated clusters of data, while we're working on the atomic level, which reveals finer structure of the data and shifts the decision making process of what is a cluster from an automated algorithm to the user. Also, this approach makes the precomputation less expensive.</p><p>Color . Multiple time series require compact visualization technique that will use as little amount of vertical space as possible. To support easy row identification, besides using positioning, we're coloring time series converted from color map suggested by ColorBrewer <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, which suggests a total of 11 different colors for qualitative data. Since the positioning along the y-axis is fixed in our case, we can repeat this color map on a larger number of categories without confusing the user. During our experiments with different time frames, datasets, and distortion functions, we noticed that the technique also works well in analysis of single time-series data for getting a quick overview and detection of potentially interesting areas. In these cases, color could be mapped to a different feature of the data.</p><p>By using real-world data, we have identified two overlapping factors that make detection of event episodes difficult, regardless of the linear or distorted timeline. The first factor is overlapping that is due to limited space, which can lead to event episodes overlapping each other. This effect is especially noticeable when working with distorted timelines. The second factor is the low density event data that is actually noise. To deal with this problem, we combine kernel density estimation, truncation function and lens distortion as focus plus context technique.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Density estimation</head><p>The overplotting effects in time series are a well known problem that may be solved to some extent by aggregation or sampling, thus leading to the loss of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In our approach, we are keeping aggregation to the minimum and leave the visual cluster identification to the user. Since we have a high overlap of event data in the past due to high logarithmic compression, we need to find a way to "penalize" low density regions, while "rewarding" high density regions.</p><p>As we have described earlier, overplotting can be caused by different factors and can not be easily avoided when working with data on atomic level. To overcome this problem, we propose a method that combines event importance function with density estimation and cut-off (truncation) function. Kernel density estimation is a nonparametric method for estimation of probability density function of a variable. The theoretical background can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and a simple example of constructing a kernel density estimate from several data points using Gaussian kernel is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>.</p><p>The idea behind using kernel estimator is to amplify the signal coming from the high dense areas and at the same time to reduce the signal in the low density areas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Importance function</head><p>For an event e i , where i ∈ (1, ..., N), importance function imp(e i ) is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">imp(e i ) = f (t) × g(d i (t))<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where t is the age of the item e i , f (t) is decay function and g(d i (t)) is a density factor.</p><p>Importance function for each individual item is mapped to its size and opacity. Decay function is position dependent part of the importance function. Depending on the amount of compression, noise and data volume, f (t) can be defined as exponential decay function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">f (t) = f (0) × e (−t/τ)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where τ is mean lifetime and f(0) = 1.</p><p>Density factor is density-dependent part of the importance function and it is calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">g(d i (t)) = Y max × d i (t) D max (t)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Here, d i (t) is kernel density estimate of event e i at time t, D max (t) is the maximum density estimate in the current time window, and Y max is coefficient used to normalize the height of the objects to maximum allowed height for each time series. We use the density factor for highly compressed areas, where the overlap is high because of the size of each individual item, thus rewarding high density areas and penalizing low density areas. It is recalculated at user-specified time intervals to accommodate new data, with smooth transitions between the old and the new values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Cut-off function</head><p>By estimating densities of our event data points, we decreased the impact of low density areas on the information display. However, the high volume of long time-series in these areas can still significantly affect the calculations, interaction and rendering of the visualization. This is especially the case when long time series contain bursts <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> of events around few peaks. When working with news data, like in our motivating example, we can expect to have such data shapes and low density areas can be treated as noise. Time-series can be truncated to areas around the peak, like in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, where data is truncated from 1 year to 128 hours, when it falls to around 10% of the peak value. In our case, the newer data is considered more important than the older data and this method can't be directly applied. Since the old events are less important then the new events, the noise removal threshold should increase with the age of data. Therefore, a cut-off function is needed, which is used to decide if the item e i should be visible or not. As a positive side effect, the compressed old data will leave only the most important event episodes due to a stronger truncation.</p><p>CloudLines technique implements different cut-off functions, such as logarithmic, square root, exponential or quadratic to compare their effect. Experiments with different datasets showed that concave functions in general give better results.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">cuto f f (x) = D max (t) X max × log( X max T max × t)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where D max (t) is the maximum density in the current time window, X max is the width of the display, and T max is the width of the time window. Therefore, if density value d i of an event e i happening at time t i is greater than the value of the cut-off function at time t i , the item should be visible.</p><p>The results of mapping the importance function and the cut-off function to opacity and size of objects representing event data in a single time-series are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. To demonstrate the idea of saving screen space with our technique, we have compared a line chart and a CloudLine, showing the same sample dataset, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Static vs Dynamic Visualization</head><p>The technique could be used in both static and dynamic scenarios. It is known that animation is not suitable for describing change of many objects on the screen, but under some circumstances, when the user is given the possibility to control the playback, the animation can be useful. In these cases, it is necessary to find a good way to show new data that was acquired while the user was analyzing the old dataset.</p><p>In our tool, it is possible to automatically adjust the time window of the observed time series and switch between the static visualization, where new data is added at fixed display coordinates, and the dynamic visualization, where data items move from present to the past according to the underlying trajectory function. In our approach, although not all of the used techniques and algorithms are incremental by nature, it would be possible to extend the approach into a fully incremental solution. Currently, the algorithm used to calculate kernel density estimates at observed data points is rerun at constant user-defined time intervals on the whole dataset, but it could be replaced with an online kernel density estimation algorithm, to adapt the densities on the incremental updates only. To avoid abrupt changes in the display that could be caused by sudden change of the density values, we used smooth animated transitions that allow the user to understand the changes.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">INTERACTION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Lens magnification with event data</head><p>The visual density of the display can lead to the occlusion of fine details in a large dataset. This is especially noticeable in the regions of "maximum age" and high data density, when the logarithmic distortion of the timeline is used. To overcome this problem, we couple proposed visualization method with magnification lens distortion technique, which allows a fine-detailed analysis of individual event data points. Focus+Context approach provides a detailed view <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> of an interesting short interval within the global overview of the long time series. The proposed focus plus context technique is further improved to allow undistorted view in the focus region, while providing smooth transition in the areas connecting the focus and context space. <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>. Lens schema from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> Lenses have been extensively researched in the human computer interaction and information visualization communities. Only recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> high magnification lenses have been more thoroughly researched as a suitable Focus+Context technique in long time series. In our approach, we employ a similar idea with two important differences: 1) our time series are event-based, not aggregated, and 2) we propose an improvement of a classical lens design that provides undistorted display of the focus region in a distorted space.</p><p>Similarly to SingalLens design <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, our lens design is based on a model described by Carpendale and Montagnese in their Elastic Presentation Framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Each lens is described by a focus region of a width f, magnification factor m and drop-off areas d f in which different functions can be used to give smooth transition between focus and context regions. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Carpendale et al. have described different distortion functions used to achieve high magnification in Elastic Presentation Framework.</p><p>In CloudLines, we employ two different types of magnification lenses: 1) lens with linear magnification, and 2) lens with exponential magnification of logarithmic content.</p><p>Interaction mechanics. The size of the lens, as well as magnification level and the width of the focus region can be set by the user. When the lens is turned on, the user can inspect the time series by click-and-drag, and when the mouse button is released, the lens is left in its last position. When an object inside the focus region is selected, the respective event details are given on demand. If the user clicks outside of the lens area, the lens is repositioned and can be moved around the screen until this feature is turned off.</p><p>Details on demand. Working with time series on item level is meaningful when each item carries information and this information has to be available for direct access for the user. For example, when working with news event data, where an event represents a timestamped news article, each item can be enriched with different metadata information, such as the url of the article, title, image, etc. This requirement is reflected in our first decision to show a single event as an object that has a minimum size that is appropriate for interaction. Sometimes, more items can arrive at exactly the same time, and in these cases, the user should be provided with details on demand for all underlying data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">EXAMPLES</head><p>To demonstrate our approach, we applied it to the news entities time series data collected by EMM news service <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. We present two examples that differ in volume and time range and show how Cloud-Lines can be used in two different scenarios: 1) exploration of multiple long time series from one month of news event data; and 2) monitoring of 24 hours of news event data, and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of our solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">CloudLines for multiple long time series news exploration</head><p>The entity event data represent the most mentioned politicians during February 2011 and each event contains information about a news article that is mentioning a specific person (shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). When working with multiple time-series, finding an optimal way to sort the time-series is a difficult problem that goes beyond the scope of this work. The problem is addressed in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and relates to the question of finding an optimal time series similarity measure. The volume of distinct time series can vary greatly and can be difficult to compare. When working with incremental data, this problem has to take into account re-sorting and has to allow for efficient computation. In our case, we have chosen 16 time series with highest overall popularity during the whole month and sorted them in a descending order.</p><p>Normalization. Time series can be normalized according to the different criteria, such as normalization to the overall volume of each time series, or to the peak value, etc. In <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, the time series are normalized to the maximum peak value for each distinct time-series, <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>. CloudLines applied on the news entities data taken during February 2011. Dataset consisting of around 117,000 events for 16 politicians with the highest volume during the whole month are shown (names are displayed on the right side). Compact visualization immediately reveals important event episodes. The fine structure of the data, such as the "pulse" of online publishing is also visible, showing higher activity in the afternoons. Detailed analysis of the visualization is given in the Subsection 6.1.</p><p>since we would like to be able to see similar event episodes when they occur across different time series. Alternatively, the user can also choose to normalize the data to the maximum overall peak in our tool.</p><p>Looking at the visualization, several event episodes stand out and details can be revealed through interaction, which is described in the Section 5. After analyzing these interesting visual clusters, the highlighted and numbered regions in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> relate to the following events:</p><p>1. The crisis in Egypt during the first half of February 2011.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>The crisis in Libya in the second half of February 2011.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.</head><p>The (German defense minister) Guttenberg plagiarism scandal.</p><p>Additionally, the visualization reveals the fine structure of the data, such as a higher volume of published articles in the afternoon, describe the "pulse" of online news sources. The goal of the examples in our work is to demonstrate the validity of our technique for quick detection of important temporal event sequences in multiple long time series, although deeper analysis of each of these events is also possible.</p><p>The example shows one important feature of this type of event data: the data varies greatly in shape and it can't be easily modeled as bursts <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">CloudLines in News Monitoring</head><p>In our second example (shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>), we are presenting the results of our approach on 24 hours of news event data in a monitoring scenario with the same choice of named entities as in the previous example. This time window is chosen for a scenario in which the user is aware of the current events, but needs to be able to follow any new incoming data. The visual density is much lower and allows the analyst to inspect individual events more easily.</p><p>The <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows transformation of the visualized data with our method applied in consecutive steps, giving the final result in the last subfigure.

In this section we will give some additional remarks regarding the scalability and weaknesses of our approach.

For the analysis of non-incremental data, offline density estimation has to be computed only once and the rendering could be optimized for highly overlapping events. In our first use case, around 117,000 events are processed and shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. To speed up the rendering, the overlapping events could be truncated and represented by a single object whose opacity would be the sum of underlying events, if their distance is less than a pre-defined ε, which depends on the loss of information that is acceptable for the user. The challenge, which is a part of our current research efforts, is seamless retrieval and re-rendering of truncated events in the focus region during user interaction. In our second case <ref type="figure">(Figure 9</ref>), which is focused on a shorter time window (24 hours), around 7,000 events are shown.</p><p>Kernel density estimators are known for having problems with tail regions of the distribution. This is especially problematic with the latest events, which will get undersmoothed due to the applied method. Second, density estimation is performed offline and re-run at userspecified time intervals. This fact currently prevents our design from being fully incremental for (near) real-time data stream monitoring. However, this problem can be overcome by applying an appropriate online density estimation algorithm and will be part of our future work.</p><p>The basic idea of our approach is to display multiple time series on atomic (event) level, i.e. without aggregation, and to allow in situ analysis of single events. The size of the event objects can introduce overplotting, especially in high density areas. The objects would have to be 1 pixel wide to minimize this problem, however the interaction would be practically impossible with such a design. There is no easy solution to overcome this problem for each and every dataset and limited screen space. Therefore, when high density areas (event episodes) are identified, the magnifying lens is used for direct inspection, thus removing overplotting in the focus region. In <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, it can be seen that circles of the same size have different transparency. This is due to the fact that the events occur at the exact same points in time. The difference in size between circles strongly depends on the chosen kernel bandwidth and local density estimate. The effect of alpha-blending overplotting increases with circle size significantly and this perceptual issue is a limitation that we would like to address in our future work.</p><p>Conclusion . In this paper, we have presented a novel interactive visualization approach for the analysis of multiple time series in lim- <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. News monitoring scenario: Transformation of news entity event data in a 24 hour time window, taken on February 21, 2011. The data is appearing on the x-axis from left to right (12:00 AM is the boundary on the left, 11:59 PM is on the right). 6,756 events are shown. From top to bottom: 1) Raw data with high overlapping on a linear timeline; 2) Density based transformation; 3) Logarithmic distortion of the timeline gives more space for the latest events and compresses the past data into visual clusters; 4) Magnification lens applied on the past -focus region with lower density is now visible, and drop-off functions create more compressed areas that connect focus and context. Interaction with individual events is now possible.</p><p>ited space. The idea behind CloudLines design is to explore the limits of large scale event data analysis on atomic level in limited space. Our first results show that our method with proposed Focus+Context techniques is worth further research. In our future work, we would like to evaluate our method with a formal user study. While we haven't conducted such a user study so far, the examples show the promising direction of our approach.</p><p>To demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of our approach, we have applied the techniques on a high-volume real world dataset in two extreme case examples. In our first example, we worked on one month of news entities event data and showed how the proposed technique can be used to:</p><p>• detect important event episodes in the time series</p><p>• show the fine structure of the event episode shapes</p><p>• interact with time series on atomic level</p><p>In our second example, we used 24 hour of news entities event data and demonstrated how the technique could be used for real-time monitoring in short time frames. Additionally, our experiments showed that the proposed visualization method could also be suitable for single time series. We believe that our approach can scale well with different data volumes, display resolutions and time ranges.</p><p>As part of our future work, we would like to improve the current lens magnification technique. Currently, we're using a cut-off function which truncates the data in order to remove the noise in the overview and increase performance. We allow the interaction in the regions of interest by using lens magnification as a Focus+Context technique. This technique could be improved by integrating a variation of semantic zoom, which would allow the retrieval of removed items at different zoom levels, based on their importance values.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
