			<abstract>
				<p>A number of usability studies report that many users of the WWW cannot find pages already visited, additionally many users cannot visualise where they are, or where they have been browsing. Currently, readily available WWW browsers provide history mechanisms that offer little or no support in the presentation and manipulation of visited sites. Manipulation and presentation of usage data, such as a browse history has been used in a number of cases to aid users in searching for previously attained data, and to teach or assist other users in their browse or searching techniques. This paper presents a virtual reality (VR) based application to be used alongside traditional Web browsers, which provides them with a flexibly tailorable real-time visualisation of their history.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Despite the recent emergence of three-dimensional format standards, the World-Wide-Web (WWW) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> remains mainly constituted of an ever-growing network of documents. As it becomes easier to publish documents, as the number of users, and thus publishers, increases and as the number of documents grows, searching for information is turning into a cumbersome and timeconsuming operation. Because of the loose inter-connection between documents, people have difficulty remembering where they have been and returning to previously visited pages.</p><p>In this paper, we will present a virtual reality (VR) based application to be used alongside traditional Web browsers. The application aims at providing a structure to the network of documents which have been visited during a browsing session. We use the different dimensions of a 3D space to position representations of documents using different metrics, in which the relationships between the documents are also depicted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">MOTIVATION</head><p>According to a global WWW usability study <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, 17.8% of the subjects report not being able to find pages already visited, 8.8 % report not being able to visualise where they have been and where they can go, and 6.4 % report not being able to determine where they are (i.e. the "lost in hyper-space" problem). This shows that finding information and organising what is found is a problem for many users. In the same study, it was shown that 87.7 % like browsing the Web in an opportunistic manner, i.e. by following links from page to page with no premeditated goal. Another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> have shown that "Back" is heavily used to return to a page, but that the history list is not. This shows that while pages tend to be revisited, the history list is mostly unused. Revisitation frequency is confirmed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Recent Web browsers offer two different history mechanisms. Netscape Communicator 4.0 and Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 implement both:</p><p>•</p><p>A history menu that contains the titles of the nth last documents that were previously visited. As described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, "Web browsers maintain a history list that operates as a stack; the most recently visited page is usually pushed onto the top of the stack, and older pages appear underneath. Pages can be popped off the stack and lost" when backtracking or browsing new branches of the Web.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>A history facility that contains a searchable history of all documents that have been visited since the installation. Information stored together with the documents includes the original location, the title, the visiting date and the number of visits. Internet Explorer additionally groups documents by their visiting date and hosting sites.</p><p>However, user studies have highlighted weaknesses in the history mechanisms found in current Web browsers:</p><p>• The history lists are textual and the information stored lacks the cues needed to find a particular page. While cues such as visiting date have been added, they still do not depict the common 'burst' mode of browsing, i.e. they are typically used intensively during a short period and then not used at all for a much longer period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The history facilities are cumbersome to use, they either request the opening of a specific menu or of a specific separate window. Searching among the different locations involves opening additional windows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The history menu is incomplete. As described earlier, large parts of the user's history are removed when they follow a new link from a previous document.</p><p>Additionally, most current Web browsers display only the document currently being visualised, and do not indicate the structure of the pages or how they relate to each other. The main browser window presents the current document, but there is no window dedicated to presenting how the current document relates to previous documents, or how the user has reached a given document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">BACKGROUND</head><p>WWW3D <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> takes a radical approach in presenting the structure of Web documents: it integrates the display of Web documents and structural information about the portion of the Web that the user has explored into a single three-dimensional structure. Documents are represented within the space as spheres. The content of the Web page is depicted on the inside of the sphere as three-dimensional icons (images, links, text elements and so on).</p><p>When a user selects a link from within a page, the new page is loaded, and represented by a new sphere. The two spheres are then connected with an arrow to visually represent the hyper-link between them. The new sphere is also connected to all existing spheres that have links to or from the current document. This results in a three-dimensional graph, representing the part of the Web that the user(s) has (have) visited so far. WWW3D uses colouring schemes to indicate the age of pages and links. An algorithm is used to keep linked documents together in order to produce clusters of inter-linked spheres over time. Alternatively, the user can arrange the spheres freely to suite personal preferences. As a result, WWW3D achieves a three-dimensional disposition that is plausible and natural but provides no correlation between the contents of the documents.</p><p>WebBook <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is a three-dimensional web browser that allows multiple pages to be viewed simultaneously and organises the pages into books. Books can order pages according to different filters such as relative-URL books (i.e. all the pages from a given site which are related to a given page), topic books, hot list books (i.e. based on the standard browser bookmark files), search reports and book books (i.e. multi-page documents published on the Web as a set of hyper-linked pages). Several books can be kept in a 3D desktop, the Web Forager. While the threedimensional metaphor used by the authors greatly improve information look-up, the structure of the Web, and in particular the relations in-between books, is not clearly highlighted.</p><p>WebMap <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> is a browser extension that shows a 2D graphical relationship between pages. Each page is represented by a small circle that can be selected to display the actual page. Links between pages are coloured to indicate whether the destination document has already been read or whether it is located on a different server. The graphs produced by WebMap can be saved, for use by others. WebMap is based on an exploratory approach, i.e. the structure of the documents are queried as a 'batch job' so that users can visualise the document space without having to visit all the documents. However, such operations are time consuming and resource intensive. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">APPROACH</head><p>As the number of publishers and documents increases dramatically, the World-Wide-Web is turning into one of the main sources of information for different working categories. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, 72.7% of the subjects report using the Web for gathering information and 54.7% report using it for their work. A few years ago, Web browsing was seen as an interesting possibility. Web browsing is now part of our working activities and the time that we spend looking for information "out there" increases. As a result, users have already started to develop their own working routines. They have learnt how to use the different facilities offered by most browsers to arrange and classify the information that can be found on the Web.</p><p>Thus to promote transparency, we intend to offer an application that can be run alongside all regular browsers, without disturbing installed working habits. Our approach is based on an application that, while running in tight inter-connection with a twodimensional WWW client, can be ignored when necessary. We aim at adding value to browsing activities, not complexity.</p><p>A driving motivation for this work includes the assistance of users in scenarios where they are searching for documents previously visited. Such scenarios include requests such as: "I want to find a page I visited this morning, er, it had no images in it"; "I remember the page was in Asia somewhere…"; "It had very many links and the latest news in it"; and, "It took a long, long time to load". Such queries are often difficult to resolve in current history mechanisms, and provide an important motivation throughout this work.</p><p>Our auxiliary tool provides the user or users with an easily recognisable presentation of their history. This presentation is tailorable in terms of its presentation of individual pages and its overall structure. To support this, a three-dimensional presentation was chosen. This provides maximum flexibility in data visualisation. Each of the three axes provide a simple means of orienting a particular metric. For example, the date of a particular page may be represented along the X-axis. This technique is exploited in a number of 3D plotting tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In such visualisations, orientation within the 3D landscape can become disorienting for novice users, and so navigational techniques are provided to maximise the presentation of the data. Organisation of the layout is configurable, through a number of different metrics, allowing users to alter the 3D structure of the visualisation to suit the current working needs. Visualisation of the Web pages themselves within the 3D structure provide an "at a glance" representation of that page. This representation is configurable, allowing a user to readily tailor its appearance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">WEBPATH CONCEPTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Producing 3D Representation Of A Web Page</head><p>WEBPATH uses the information contained in the HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> description of each browsed Web document to produce a representation in 3D space. Each web document is represented as a cube that is labelled with the document's title 1 on top, which always faces the user. We have chosen cubes and not spheres as in WWW3D because their surfaces will often be texture mapped. Texture mapping a sphere is subject to too many deformations and using spheres would thus prevent recognition.</p><p>Displaying text in current VR systems is still not entirely satisfactory. Furthermore, text tends to be difficult to read from a distance. As a result, WEBPATH offers an additional method to recognise that a cube represents a given document: the surface of the cube shows one of the following artefacts (in order of preference):</p><p>• The background image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The first image in-lined in the HTML document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The background colour.</p><p>These artefacts are extracted from the different HTML tags contained in the document description. MosaicG uses thumbnail pictures of the documents on each node of the hierarchy. We preferred to experiment with our iconic representation since we feared that a thumbnail picture would again prevent easy recognition from a distance.</p><p>We have found that the preference order described above works surprisingly well with most of the pages that we have visited. However, cubes carry interactive icons above them to change their external appearance. It is then possible to choose another image if the initial image did not summarise the document in a satisfactory way. The cube appearance choice can also be made from a more traditional 2D interface. Both methods are depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>The chosen document appearance is saved to a preference file for future WEBPATH sessions.</p><p>To reduce the visual complexity of the environment and scale up to long browsing sessions involving many documents, WEBPATH uses Level of Detail (LOD). The title on top of a document's cube is replaced by a simple polygon from a distance. Additionally, the icons on top of the cubes are suppressed from a distance. As a result, rendering complexity is reduced. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: On top of the cube are two small diamond-shaped icons, one of which can be used to modify its appearance. The figure also shows the two-dimensional window from which the appearance can also be modified</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Browsing the Web in Conjunction with WEBPATH</head><p>When a user loads a new document (using any of the methods offered by existing browsers: bookmarks, history facilities, manual location entry, etc.), WEBPATH will create a new cube and the user will be smoothly transported in front of it. In order to indicate the structure of the Web that the user has just explored, WEBPATH will draw an arrow between the previous cube and the new one. The colour of the arrow will indicate if the destination document originates from the same site as the previous document. The aim of the arrow is two-fold: it shows that the documents are hyper-linked and it shows the user went from the source document to the destination document.</p><p>WEBPATH uses three orthogonal dimensions to visualise the browse history. A number of metrics are available, which may be associated to one of the horizontal axes. The vertical axis is reserved to portray the time at which the document was loaded, so that the last visualised document is always the top-most one. The metrics for the horizontal axes are listed below, and can be dynamically selected and configured through the two-dimensional interface. When a metric is changed, all the cubes are repositioned accordingly, as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. The different metrics are:</p><p>• The document loading time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The number of links contained in the document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The number of images in-lined in the document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The number of hypertext anchors in the document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The number of hypertext paragraphs in the document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The size of the document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The date of last modification of the document, as sent back by the Web server.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The server containing the document, so that all documents that originate from a given server are aligned. In addition to these metrics a 'geographic' layout view is available which defines the position of documents in the horizontal axes. The documents' positions are related, through the hostname of their URL, to a geographic location. For example, the site www.comp.lancs.ac.uk would identify the document as being from the UK. The ground plane, in this layout view, is superimposed with an image of the world, and documents are placed over their respective countries of origin, see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. Currently the URL resolution database maps a country to its capital city, hence in the above example the document would be placed over the geographic location of London. A more detailed database offers more accurate placement of documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 4: Documents positioned according to their geographic origins. (The UK is in the lower left)</head><p>If a document happens to be revisited, it will generate a new cube, as opposed to MosaicG and WWW3D. We consider that the document is visited at a later time and, thus, will have a different position than its previous representation along the vertical axis. However, the metrics for revisited documents are not recalculated, which might lead to inconsistencies and errors, especially when loading time is used. All the cubes representing the same document visited at different times, are linked together using a yellow column, as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref>. The column accentuates recognition of these cubes being the representations of the same document, but at different times. The column turns increasingly red as the number of visits to the same document increases.  Clicking on a cube will send the browser back to the corresponding location. As a result, this will create the linking column in-between both documents, if it did not already exist.</p><p>When the user selects a new document location using the different direct methods (i.e. bookmarks, history facilities or manual entry) we consider that they are starting a new thread, i.e. a new session.</p><p>Here, semi-transparent horizontal plane, covering the whole visualisation area is generated just below the new cube, the visibility of the plane can be toggled on or off as required.</p><p>Motivation for the use of planes in this way include:</p><p>• Once many planes have been created (i.e. when a user has started several Web searches) old documents, at the bottom of the visualisation space, will disappear in a 'foggy mist ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref>. Thus, reducing the user's awareness of their previous results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>When looking back for previous documents, all the cubes resulting from a browsing sub-session are "isolated" inbetween two semi-transparent layers, which highlight them. This is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Using The WEBPATH Environment</head><p>'Delimiting semi-transparent planes' can be inserted into the virtual environment and moved along the vertical axis from both the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional interface, as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref>. These planes visualise the value of the metric associated to the axis along which they slide. Using these planes and the different metrics, it is possible to analyse the data set and answer common questions such as:</p><p>• Which documents are older that a given date? • Which are the long documents? • Which documents take time to be loaded into the browser?</p><p>In addition to their layout, the documents can be associated with a user-defined textual note that can be edited and visualised at any time. Annotated documents are highlighted in the visualisation space. Annotating the nodes in this way provides users with the ability to record information particular to that document in the browse. For example, a user may record the source of a manually entered site, or describe the aesthetic appearance of the document. The flexible layout options enable users to quickly reconfigure their view of the document space to help them search for particular, previously visited, documents. Earlier in this paper, a number of case scenarios were presented. Solutions to these queries may be simply offered by WEBPATH:</p><p>• "I want to find a page I visited this morning, er, it had no images in it". A delimiting plane along the vertical axis can be used to simply identify the documents visited during the morning, and by selecting the metric number of images in-lined in the document, the desired document will be at the origin of the axis assigned to this metric. • "I remember the page was in Asia somewhere…". Using the geographic layout, the required document will be present over the Asian geographic region.</p><p>• "It had very many links and the latest news in it". Using the metrics: number of links contained in the document and date of last modification of the document, the document can be made to appear near the origin of both axis.</p><p>"It took a long, long time to load". Simply selecting the metric document loading time will identify documents by how long they took to download. Here, another metric may be used to further enhance the search. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">WEBPATH -THE IMPLEMENTATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">DIVE</head><p>The Distributed Interactive Virtual Environment (Dive) is an experimental platform for the development of virtual environments, user interfaces and applications based on shared 3D synthetic environments. Dive is especially tuned to multi-user applications, where several networked participants interact over an internet. Initially developed as a lab tool in 1991, Dive has evolved into a mature system running on many platforms2. The Dive architecture is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>One particular aspect of DIVE which is exploited by WEBPATH is its interface to the TCL scripting language <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The DIVE/TCL interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> implements a superset of TCL from which many aspects of the virtual environment can be controlled. In this scripting language, each entity of the environment, including objects, actors and worlds, can be associated with a TCL script. The script is triggered by DIVE events and will describe how the entity will react to user interaction and stimuli from the environment. The DIVE/TCL interface has two major advantages:</p><p>• It hides the complexity of the distributed VR platform behind a simpler programming interface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>It reduces development time and costs since TCL is a concise language that does not require any compilation.</p><p>Additionally the DIVE/TCL scripting language is used to offer a simple, but powerful, interface for external applications: the DIVE Client Interface (DCI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Any DIVE application can act as a server that communicates with external applications using a defined protocol. Applications can submit DIVE/TCL commands to be executed and, if required, retrieve a result.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">WEBPATH</head><p>In order to be able to work together with any web browser, WEBPATH implements an HTTP <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> proxy server. All types of documents are fetched by the proxy server and delivered to the user's web browser. Hypertext documents are further forwarded to the main module of the WEBPATH application. This module will analyse the content of the URL, gather statistics and create or update a (new) data structure for that location. The information is shown to the user through a traditional two-dimensional interface, as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Additionally, a three-dimensional representation for the document is created in the DIVE browser by communicating through the DCI interface. Other artefacts such as arrows representing links and delimiting planes are also added if required. All information about documents and links are stored together with their representation in the virtual environment. Use of this feature is be explained below. Note that because TCL is an extensible scripting language, WEBPATH installs, on start-up, several new procedures. These procedures are used during a session for creating objects or parsing the database of virtual entities. This solution reduces the communication overhead between the VR browser and WEBPATH. The overall software architecture is depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>.</p><p>When events such as user interaction on the icons on top of a document's representations occur, they are forwarded to the main module through the DCI interface. When the user requests an appearance modification, i.e. changing the picture used for the document representation, the main module sends an update to the VR database through the DCI interface. When the user interacts with the representation of a document, thus requesting to visualise the document a second time, the main module requests the web browser to visualise the location again 3 . WEBPATH will be notified of this new document through its proxy server, as described above.</p><p>One particularity of the DIVE browser is that it can save a snapshot of a simulation to a file and restart in this snapshot later on. WEBPATH makes use of this facility to allow users to continue a previously saved browsing session. Document and link information is parsed back from the virtual database and sent back to WEBPATH, in which all data structures are rebuilt. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> The current implementation only works together with Netscape's browser on UNIX workstations. However, both Netscape Communicator and Microsoft Internet Explorer can be controlled using DDE or OLE on Windows platforms. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WebPath Application</head><p>The Web <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>: The software architecture of WEBPATH.</p><p>WEBPATH has been used on a range of machines. We ran WEBPATH on three different machines: a Silicon Graphics 02; a Silicon Graphics Onyx; and a Pentium II based PC with a with a 3D accelerator graphics card. The time taken by each system to render a single frame was generated for each system; this was then used to calculate the average frame rate. The data was generated using WEBPATH in a number of increasingly complex histories. The results are depicted in the table below. The above table demonstrates that with a reasonably complex history of fifty nodes, WEBPATH operates at approximately ten frames per second on the Silicon Graphics O2 and the 3D accelerated Pentium II based machine. We found this frame rate sufficiently high for general use. Hence, although very complex histories may require the power of high-end workstations such as the Silicon Graphics Onyx, more manageable histories may be readily used on entry-level machines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We have detailed the motivation for an enhanced history visualisation tool to aid Web browsing. WEBPATH is such a tool that unobtrusively visualises a user's trail as they browse the Web, which can be tailored to best suit the users working needs. WEBPATH provides users with a graphical view of their recent activities, enabling them to, for example, see how a given document was reached and perform complex searches for previous documents visited.</p><p>Further work includes the ability for users to issue queries within the document space, as found in systems such as Q-PIT <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In such systems documents that match a particular query or filter are highlighted. This would give users a two-pass approach for searching the document space: positional metrics and query highlighting. Other work introduces the notion of keywords as supported in HTML 3. Keywords describe the features of the document, such as its language, and can be used within new layout metrics.</p><p>An important requirement for the on-going development of WEBPATH is the introduction of usability studies. Such studies will provide us with the ability to enhance WEBPATH through highlighting its strengths and weaknesses.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>WEBPATH is articulated around three different applications, each with its own user interface.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>MosaicG<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> is a modified version of the Mosaic browser that incorporates a graphical history mechanism. MosaicG depicts a left-to-right hierarchical history of the Web pages visited during a browsing session. As opposed to WebMap, MosaicG incrementally constructs the hierarchy as users traverse links from one page to another. A major drawback with MosaicG is that it requests the use of a specific browser.PadPrints<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> is a prototype zooming Web browser within a multiscale graphical environment. Instead of having a single page visible at a time, multiple pages and the links between them are depicted on a large zoomable information surface. Pages are scaled so that the page in focus is clearly readable with connected pages shown at smaller scales to provide context. As MosaicG, PadPrints is a specific browser. Furthermore, the only information that it enhances is the connections between the different documents.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
