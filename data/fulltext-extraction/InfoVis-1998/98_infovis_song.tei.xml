			<abstract>
				<p>The purpose of the paper is to develop a visualization system of a document space, called BiblioMapper, for CISI collections, one of the bibliographic databases available on the Internet. The major function of BiblioMapper is to visualize the document space with a cluster-based visualization technique. The cluster-based visualization technique assembles a set of documents according to semantic similarities. One advantage of this technique is that users are able to focus on and assess each cluster and the documents which the cluster comprises according to their information needs.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In the traditional paradigm of Information Retrieval (IR), the matching mechanism between a query and the corresponding document sets has prevailed. In this paradigm, users have to rely on their subjective understanding of how the system is designed and judge the retrieved documents based on that restricted understanding of the system. Initially, users probably have search strategies to obtain what they want from the system. In many cases, however, the initial search strategies planned by the users prove to be unsatisfactory. Even though users may reformulate the queries in iterative searching, this is not particularly cost effective. This situation is exacerbated for novice users who have difficulty in formulating valid search strategies and queries.</p><p>In order to be properly prepared for the variety of information needs of users, IR systems tend to be overelaborated and over-sophisticated, which makes it more difficult for the user to understand and use the system. Olsen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> concluded that these problems are due to the opacity of IR systems to users. They argued that in the traditional paradigm, users have no way of seeing the structures or processes with which they are dealing. Mental models constructed by the users tend to be ineffective in mapping out the data space <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. For these reasons, visualization could play a pivotal role in reducing the navigational difficulties of traditional IR systems by giving users an insight into how information is stored and structured, allowing the user to navigate the information space more easily .</p><p>Visual Information Retrieval Interfaces, or VIRI, have been increasingly applied recently to IR system design. BiblioMapper, a VIRI being tested with CISI collections (data collections of library and information sciences) builds on these approaches by using a clusterbased visualization technique.</p><p>This technique groups a set of documents according to semantic similarities. Each cluster represents the topical relevance of the documents to other documents. Clusters are formed with a centroid-centered cluster display. Users are able to focus on and assess each cluster and the documents which the cluster comprises according to their information needs. Users, therefore, can localize their navigation and satisfy their information needs without browsing whole datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">LITERATURE REVIEW</head><p>There have been several attempts to visualize document space. Most of the techniques that automatically cluster all the documents use either some form of neural network techniques such as Kohonen's self organizing maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> or clustering algorithms. Kohonen's maps determine the position of documents by using neural network techniques to evaluate document similarity. The documents with topical relevance are clustered close to one another. Some systems that have taken this approach are Bead <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, Lin's works <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, WEBSOM <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, DEPICT <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, and Galaxies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>.</p><p>WEBSOM is a web-based visual interface based on the Kohonen algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Even though this technique has the advantages of good color coding and label support, it requires long pre-processing time for visualization. Adding data is another problem. Lin's studies in this line are specialized to design of a simple visual interface for a domain-specific area based on Kohonen's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. His approach gives the users of the system a good overview of what semantic relationships between documents are in the database. The test collection (ranges are 143 to 660 documents) is relatively small, which could lead to the scalibility problem. In addition, the system may require additional cognitive processing by users in the actual stage of the browsing activities. Because the system does not support showing semantic relationships between innerclass documents, users have to judge the relevance of documents to their information needs by looking through the titles of documents. Similarly, Galaxies computes word similarities and patterns in documents and then displays the documents on a screen to look like a universe of "docustars" <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. This technique distributes each "docustar" evenly on the screen so that it manages screen space efficiently. A major concern of this approach is how effectively users can navigate the document space. In a space with a huge amount of "docustars," it is not easy for users to select the docustar that they desire to explore. This type of the problem is common in the visual interfaces implemented with "Galaxies" metaphor <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The BEAD system is a representative one, implemented by multi-dimensional scaling technique to convert the documents to vectors and N-body technique (well-known in computational physics) to calculate the distance among documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. This novel approach to visualizing bibliographic data by computational geometric technique has the shortcomings of non-textual aid on the interface and a relatively small test collection (301 documents in HCI).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">THE BIBLIOMAPPER SYSTEM</head><p>BiblioMapper has some advantages over other visualization systems of document space in the following aspects: 1. The test collection (1460 documents) can be displayed in a screen space without overlapping scatter plots even when there are large number of documents. This size of data is appropriate for any experimental purpose. 2. BiblioMapper was built up by a novel algorithm of hierarchical clustering techniques. In this algorithm, the number of clusters is determined by the theta value that is automatically assigned by the system. The greater a theta value, the smaller the number of clusters. In the follow-up study, the interaction technique associated with relevance feedback will be integrated to BiblioMapper. This further step will be done by automatically training the system with user feedback. 3. BiblioMapper helps users to localize their browsing activities into a cluster that they want to navigate. This feature intensifies the strength of Kohonen's technique, which is to generate the boundaries of clusters that are identical, and the strength of Galaxies-like techniques, which show the semantic distances between inner-class documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Document Classification in BiblioMapper</head><p>There are several methods for producing representative structures of textual documents. The bestknown methods are the boolean model, the probabilistic model, the string search model, and the vector space model, all of which originated in classic IR research. This project used the vector space model (VSM) which is widely recognized as an effective retrieval method. VSM accepts a set of textual documents as input and produces a set of vectors (representing individual documents) whose locations in the document space are fixed based on multiple weights (dimensions) assigned to them as output <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. For BiblioMapper, weights for the vectors were assigned by generating frequencies for individual terms appearing in the documents.</p><p>One common way to compute the weight of a term is to multiply the term frequency (tf ) factor with the inverse document frequency (idf) factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. The vector representations of the documents are computed for the weight of a term x i by the formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">idf i = log (1/fraction of documents with x i )</formula><p>The tf factor is proportional to the frequency of the term within the document. The idf factor corresponds to the content discriminating value of the terms. The degree of similarity between a document-profile pair is based on the weights of the corresponding matching terms. In BiblioMapper, the similarity was measured by the cosine coefficient, a well-known method to measure similarity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">( formula 1 ) sim 1 ( D , P ) = m 3 i = 1 w i u i m 3 i = 1 w 2 i m 3 i = 1 u 2 i</formula><p>given document D = (w 1 , ..., w m ) and a profile P = (u 1 , ..., u m ) where w i and u i is the weight assigned to the I-th term and is 0 for terms not present in D and P The document and profile vector are normalized by their lengths. The result of tests by Willett <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> of similarity coefficients in cluster-based retrieval suggest that it is important to use a measure that is normalized by the length of the document vector. Thus, the above formula 1 can be simplified to: To classify the documents into a co-related corpus which has a high degree of association between documents of the same corpus and a low degree between members of a different corpus, this paper uses the hierarchical clustering method <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The hierarchical clusterings transform document-term matrices into a sequence of nested partitions.</p><p>The clustering algorithm used in this study is based on a minimum distance pairs technique similar to the Ward's minimum variance clustering algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. Minimum distance pairs are established by keeping track of both the nearest neighbor of each data point and the distance. The nearest neighbors are initially computed in O(N 2 ) time. It is assumed that the similarity between the chosen documents is the inner product of two vectors using appropriately weighted vectors (see formula 1). In this case, the similarity between a cluster centroid and any other document is equal to the mean similarity between the document and all the other documents in the cluster. Since the centroid of the cluster is the mean of all the document vectors, the centroid can be used to compute the similarities between the clusters while requiring only O(n) space.</p><p>When a new cluster is formed, one of the child nodes is discarded, while the other is replaced by the new node to represent the new cluster. Each of the other points is checked to see whether the nearest neighbor is reconstructed by the new cluster. When two objects w and wj are clustered, the distance measure DIS1(w, wi) is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">( formula 3 ) DIS 1 ( w , w i ) = k − 1 3 i = 0 ( w i − w ji ) 2</formula><p>where wi is the ith object of the vector w and xji is the ith object of the class j, for k-dimensional vectors</p><p>The distance between these objects is a straight Euclidean distance. Therefore, the distance can be computed by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">( formula 4 ) DIS 2 ( w , w j ) = 2 w -w j 2</formula><p>In this equation, classification would involve finding the xj that has the maximum correlation value -the output from the class is then j. The definition of cluster centers is a weighted average of the subcluster centers.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">( formula 5 ) Centroid = k 3 i = 1 t i w i k 3 i = 1 t i</formula><p>where ti is the number of objects in the vector vi and wi is represented by a vector <ref type="figure">(xi1, xi2, .</ref>.., xik) in the kdimensional space</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Visualization of a Document Space</head><p>The visualization technique used in the BiblioMapper system is based on the multidimensional scaling of the similarities between the inner-class vectors and dissimilarities between the outer-class vectors generated from the minimum distance pairs algorithm to plot one point in Euclidean space for each document. These points form a semantic scatterplot by clustering similar documents around a centroid. The degree of similarity, associated with topical relevance, is determined by the distance of vectors from the centroid. The centroid represents the subjectivity of each class. Since semantic relationships are represented by this distance and there might be some documents with the same distance from a centroid, plotting the points with the same distance poses a problem. In order to overcome this problem, the angle of two vector points are computed by cosine formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">( formula 6 ) cosine ( θ ) = v i v j v 2 i v 2 j</formula><p>where vi is the i-th vector and vj is the j-th vector</p><p>BiblioMapper represents each document as a point in two-dimensional space. The distance between two representative points, one a document and the other a centroid, is roughly proportional to the corresponding vectors. This makes it possible for the documents representing more clearly the subjectivity of a class to be mapped out close to the centroid in two-dimensional space, much like books on the shelves of a library arranged by some classification schemes. Kohonen's map visualizes the document space in a manner similar to BiblioMapper by dividing the available space into semantic regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Clusters that are near one another on the BiblioMapper do not have the property that they represent similar themes of information. This subject independent display of inter-clusters may be less effective for the users whose information needs are better satisfied by displaying some regions of similar themes. However, BiblioMapper would be better suited for the users who have clear and simple information needs. The locations of each cluster are assigned automatically by the system. The size of each cluster is determined by the number of clusters. Since some clusters consist of over several hundred documents, it is necessary to provide the users navigating these high dense clusters with zooming functions. In BiblioMapper, the clusters of interest are zoomed in by clicking the labels. The algorithm of cluster labeling is related to finding an appropriate label for each cluster. First, a central vector is computed for the cluster. This is done by taking the weighted average of the vectors belonging to the nodes in the cluster. This centroid cluster vector is compared to all of the stem word vectors in the vocabulary. The stem word vector that results in the highest dot product with the centroid cluster vector becomes the label for the region.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Interface Design Module</head><p>The database being tested with BiblioMapper is CISI collection (1460 document surrogates). The test collection was downloaded from the IDOMENEUS technology transfer server running in the department of computing science at the University of Glasgow. The presented version of BiblioMapper was designed to function in the X window environment. The system was built and run on a Silicon Graphics Indigo Extreme. Tcl/tk was used to build up interfaces of BiblioMapper. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> presents a typical view of the BiblioMapper interface. There are 14 clusters, with each cluster divided by a rectangular area. For each cluster, the user is presented with the topical words that represent the text contents of the documents in a cluster. A list of topical words of a cluster is shown in the pop-up menu window by clicking on a cluster number. If the user wants to look into one of clusters, the selected cluster is opened by pointing the mouse cursor onto the cluster. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> is the window of the selected cluster. For the user who wants to see the title of a document first, the title window is opened up by double clicking with the first button of the mouse on a icon <ref type="figure">(Figure 3)</ref>. When the user wants to see the document surrogate, by double clicking with the second button of the mouse on the icon, the document window is pulled up on the screen <ref type="figure">(Figure 4)</ref>. Users judge the relevance of documents according to a scale whose range is from 0 to 10. Relevance judgments are saved in a log file.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CONCLUSION</head><p>The major purpose of this study is to demonstrate that cluster-based visualization techniques can be used to visualize a set of bibliographic records and semantic relationships of a document space. These techniques can also be used to create visual cues in IR systems to promote perceptual inferences during the search process. Furthermore, these techniques can be used both as overview tools or as access or exploration tools. In the future, cluster-based visualization can play a critical role in implementing interactive IR systems by allowing the users to see and interact with the rich information revealed by this visualization technique.</p><p>The system was initially developed as a component for a prototype'static information environment.' Further development of the underlying model could make BiblioMapper a very effective and interactive exploration tool for the dynamic information situation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">FURTHER STUDY</head><p>There are three major goals for the follow-up study. The first is to enhance 'scalability' of the present system, the second is to integrate BiblioMapper into the large-scale of IR system, and the third is to test user information seeking behavior in the visual environment.</p><p>Due to the tentative stage of the present BiblioMapper, the system needs to be scaled up and strengthened with additional functionalities. As this work progresses, I will be able to determine where future effort should be concentrated, what the focus of usability testing should be, what the strengths and weaknesses of the basic modelling process are, and what types of tools and styles of interaction make the best use of such models.</p><p>For most VIRIs, it was hypothesized that the geometrically-represented document space provides users with a 'naturalistic' model of document relationships. Interactive visualization and navigation of the information space should then facilitate browsing and exploration of the corpus. These hypotheses have not been empirically investigated. The follow-up study will tackle this problem by conducting such usability experiments.</p><p>The ultimate goal of the follow up study would be to make information space explorable by both users in the visual information environment and the underlying search engine in complex large-scale systems. To this end, BiblioMapper will be combined with querying to provide the users with enhanced exploration tools. Since most of the visualization systems of document space were not combined with querying, the power of exploring IR systems in this way is hard to estimate fully. A recent experiment of users' performance on these systems indicates that the visual representation provided by Kohonen SOM map, which does not support querying, is suitable for browsing searches rather than for analytical searches <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In addition, the experimental study will follow various user groups as they search/navigate the information space and then measure their browsing performances to investigate the usability of the system from the user's point of view. Thus, the main focus of the follow-up study would be to investigate how users might use a database of document-based information for formal queries as well as more casual, exploratory use of this visual environment. These studies will further test how their information seeking behavior in the visual environment is different from the non-visual environment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>(</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
