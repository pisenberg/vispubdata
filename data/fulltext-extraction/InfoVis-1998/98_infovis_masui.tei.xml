				<p>We propose a simple and powerful graphical interface tool called the LensBar, for filtering and visualizing a large list of data. Browsing and querying are the most important techniques for information retrieval, and LensBar integrates the two techniques into a simplelooking scroll window with a slider. While it looks familiar to users of conventional graphical interface tools, its filtering and zooming mechanism offers sophisticated handling of large lists of text-oriented data.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Recently, various visualization techniques for browsing large data have been proposed. Also, a number of information retrieval techniques for filtering huge data using query keywords are also proposed. In some systems, visualization and filtering are integrated and users can filter and browse the data at the same time.</p><p>Although the combination of browsing and querying is much more powerful than using each of the techniques separately, most of the existing systems suffer from the following shortcomings. First, most of the visualization techniques are far from general-purpose, and they are applicable only to special application domains. Second, special interaction techniques are usually required to effectively filter data and control the visualization result. For example, using the FilmFinder system <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, users can get the information of movie titles by providing information such as the names of actors and the year of the production, and they can control the visualized query result shown as a scattered plot on a 2D space. However, the filtering and visualization method is only valid to this particular application, and the whole design of the visualization and interaction techniques should be modified for different applications.</p><p>It is natural that handling special data requires special visualization and interaction techniques, but it seems strange that even for handling a common data structure like a text or a simple list of data, not many effective techniques for query and visualization have been proposed and used widely.</p><p>We propose a simple and powerful interface tool called the LensBar for filtering and visualizing a large list of data. LensBar works as an extension to a conventional scroll window or a substitute for a hierarchical menu, and it can be applicable to wide range of applications where these tools are currently used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">VISUALIZATION AND INTERACTION TECH-NIQUES</head><p>Our technique is based on the following strategies.</p><p>Browsing the whole list using a precisely-controllable slider and a scroll window</p><p>Controlling the amount of data to be displayed by keyword filtering and zooming</p><p>Visualizing the distribution of filtered data in the background of the slider</p><p>We will describe the techniques in more detail in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integrating browsing and querying</head><p>To browse a large list, we use a slider (scroll bar) with an accompanied scroll window, which is a very common combination in current graphical user interface systems. In addition to them, an extra text input area is attached for filtering the list of items, and only those entries that match the specified pattern are selected and displayed in the scroll window. At the same time, corresponding positions in the slider background are highlighted to show the locations of entries which match the pattern. For example, if the first entry in the list match the pattern, the top line of the slider background is highlighted. When no pattern is specified, all the lines in the slider background are highlighted, yielding a highlighted rectangle in the slider background. When a user tries to move the slider knob, it only moves on the highlighted portion. The highlighted region within the slider knob always corresponds to the displayed items in the scroll window.</p><p>When the user modifies the query pattern, string matching is immediately performed to all the entries in the list, and the display of the slider background and the scroll window also change immediately. With this dynamic query <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> feature, users can easily find the relation between query pattern and the distribution of data items. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Initial display of the dictionary application Dynamic approximate string matching When no entry in the list matches the specified pattern, dynamic approximate string matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> is performed automatically, and entries which are closest to the pattern are treated as being matched. This is usually much more convenient than giving no query result when no matching is found, and especially useful when users are not very sure of the spelling: e.g. searching for a word in a dictionary of a foreign language.</p><p>Zooming interface Users can control the amount of information to be displayed by zooming operations. Before zooming out, all the entries that match the query can be displayed by moving the slider knob, just like a conventional scrolling window. Using LensBar, a user can control the amount of items to be displayed by changing the zooming level. A DOI (degree of interest) value is dynamically assigned to each entry automatically, and only those entries whose DOI value is bigger than the zooming level are selected to be displayed. For example, when the zooming level is set to a large value, items with small DOI values disappear to produce a zooming out effect.</p><p>Zooming interface is essential in 3D interaction systems, and it is also proved to be effective in 2D GUI <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Although zooming interfaces for handling a (1D) large list is not as widely used as handling 3D/2D objects, it is convenient to control the amount of displayed data smoothly.</p><p>Precise control of the slider Using a conventional slider, precise scrolling of a very large data is difficult, since the resolution of the display and the pointing device is low. To enable precise control, conventional scroll bars sometimes have up and down arrows around the knob or at the top and bottom of the bar. Other techniques for fine control of the slider have also been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, and we adopted the technique described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. When a user clicks the mouse on the knob of the slider, he can move the knob directly to any place on the bar, just like a conventional slider. When the user clicks the mouse on the scroll bar other than on the knob, the knob will move gradually to the mouse cursor, in a speed proportional to the distance between the mouse position and the knob, and users can control the moving speed of the knob easily.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">EXAMPLES</head><p>It would be best to use examples to show how each of the techniques described in the previous section actually works. Since LensBar is a general-purpose tool for visualizing and filtering a large list, we introduce various examples to show how the technique is applicable to different applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Example 1: Searching Words In a Dictionary</head><p>First, we show the behavior of LensBar using a simple dictionary application. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the initial display of a dictionary application using LensBar. In the left side, a slider with a transparent knob is displayed. In the background of the slider area, a highlighted rectangle is displayed, showing that all the entries in the dictionary are currently selected for display. In <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, only ten words which correspond to the position of the knob are shown in the scrollable area at the right. The highlighted line at the center of the knob shows the position and the size of the ten words in the whole list.</p><p>The dictionary contains more than 30,000 words. The user can drag the knob to any position of the dictionary, and he can click other place in the slider to move the knob precisely ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2)</ref>. He can also drag the scroll window by clicking the mouse in the window and dragging it vertically.  In this dictionary application, DOI value is assigned to each line, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Since "graphics" is currently selected, it has the largest DOI value. When the user clicks the mouse on a word and drags it to the left, the zooming level changes accordingly, and the number of words to be displayed are gradually reduced and wider range of words appear in the scroll window. For example, when the zooming level is 2.0, every two word around "graphics" is displayed. In <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, every 256 word in the dictionary is displayed (zooming level is around 9), and in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, every 4096 word is displayed. Hidden entries are shown as gray lines between words. At the same time, the background of the slider changes to show the distribution of the selected words. As the range of the displayed words becomes larger, the slider knob also becomes larger to cover the area. The zooming level is determined by the horizontal movement of the mouse. Since the scrolling window follows the vertical movement of the mouse, the mouse cursor is always on the line of the same word ("graphics", in this case) during the zooming operation, and when the user moves the mouse cursor back to the previous position, the system goes exactly back to the previous state. This continuous and reversible characteristic of zooming interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> helps users recover from erroneous operations easily.</p><p>When the user enters a pattern string, dynamic approximate pattern matching is performed and only those entries that match the pattern are selected for display. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows the display after the <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>: Filtering by "g" user specified "g" as the pattern string. The whole list is filtered and only those words which begin with "g" are selected and displayed.</p><p>A space character (" ") is used as a wildcard character, just like the pattern ".*" used in regular expressions. So when " q" is specified as the pattern, all the words which include the letter "q" are selected ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 6</ref>). Since those words are scattered in the dictionary, the highlighted area in the slider looks like a comb. Let's consider finding a word with difficult spelling like "Pithecanthrop <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 7</ref> shows the display of LensBar after a user typed a wrong spelling "pite", showing that only two words in the dictionary begins with "pite". At this moment, the user can tell that "pite..." is not the right spelling for "Pithecantropus", but he can continue giving more letters as the pattern. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>: Typing "pitec" <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>: "Pithecanthropus" found from "piteca" When the user types "c" next, the string matcher notices that there is no word in the dictionary that begin with "pitec", and all the words that match the pattern "pitec" with one error are searched and displayed. Many words including "pitch" and "piteous" match "pitec" with one error, and they are displayed in the scroll window. The text input area becomes darker, showing that no exact matching was found. When the user types "a" next, words like "pitch" disappear because they do not match "piteca" with one error, and only "Pithecanthropus" becomes visible. In this way, by dynamically changing the parameter of the approximate string matching algorithm and showing the words closest to the pattern, users can always see the candidates closest to the given pattern and have better chance of finding the desired information.</p><p>When the user is not sure of the spelling, he can explicitly use wildcard characters instead of specifying uncertain letters. <ref type="figure">Figure  10</ref> shows the situation where a user tries to find "Mediterranean", and specifies only small number of characters that he thinks must exist in that word. Since there are only five words in the dictionary which have "m", "d", "t", "r" and "n" in its spelling, the user can easily find the desired word in the list. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Example 2: File/Message Browser</head><p>Handling huge number of files and e-mail messages is not a trivial task, especially when a user sends and receives a number of email messages every day. LensBar is very useful for file/message browsers, since integration of browsing and querying helps the user finding desired document or message easily.</p><p>In the file/message browser shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>, two LensBars are used. The one at the top shows the titles of files and messages listed in chronological order. The LensBar at the bottom shows the contents of the selected message. It does not have a text input area for filtering, but it is used as a substitute for conventional scrollable text window (with a scrollbar with uniform background.) When the user enters a keyword, messages which contain the keyword are selected, and the content of the selected message is shown in the scroll window at the bottom. When a user enters a pattern "uist", messages and files related to the UIST conference are selected and listed. Since the messages and files are listed in chronological order, he can see his activity related to the keyword. In this case, he can tell that he was active on the subject around 3/17 and 1/27, and he can check what he was doing around that time by checking other files and messages around it. It is useful for remembering what the user was doing when he received a message. In this sense, this browser can be viewed as another implementation of the Lifestreams system <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, with more powerful searching and browsing mechanism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Example 3: Program Browser</head><p>LensBar is also useful for browsing program texts. <ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref> shows how the program lensbar.c can be viewed using LensBar. <ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>: Program browser When a variable name "mousex" is specified as the filtering pattern, declaration statements and assignment statements related to the variable are selected and listed in the scroll window ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure  14)</ref>. Positions corresponding to the lines are also shown in the background of the slider, showing where in the program those lines exist.  Since lines with less indentation is usually more important in C program texts, large DOI values are assigned to lines with small indentation, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. Lines which match the pattern string have positive DOI values, and other lines have DOI values smaller than or equal to zero. When the user drags the mouse to the right to expand the list, lines with large DOI values will emerge. In this case, function definitions can be seen in addition to the lines which contain "mousex" <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Figure 15</ref>). In this way, users can focus on a variable and examine a long program text, while seeing the global context, just like using the FractalView editor <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> or other editors which supports focus+context editing based on the generalized fisheye views technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Since this program browser is line-oriented, extending it to work as a text editor can easily be done.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Example 4: Hierarchical Menu</head><p>LensBar can also be used as a substitute for a hierarchical menu. Although hierarchical menus are widely used in current graphical user interfaces, it suffers from many shortcomings. First, users can't see how large and deep the menu is. Second, users can't tell whether the menu contains the entry they want, until they search the hierarchy intensively. Third, the operation is usually not reversible. That is, when a user does something wrong (e.g. selecting a wrong menu entry), he sometimes cannot go back to the previous state by moving the mouse in the reverse direction, but he has to do the entire selection operation from the start.</p><p>Using a LensBar in place of a conventional hierarchical menu, all of the above problems are solved. We show this by using the directory structure of Unix as an example of a very large hierarchical menu. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 16</ref> shows the initial display of the menu. Files and directories under /usr/lib/ is listed. In this application, large DOI value is assigned to higher-level menu entries.  When the user drags the mouse to the left from the position, the menu will be shrunk to look like <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 19</ref>. This is similar to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 17</ref>, but all the operation is continuous and reversible, and unlike conventional hierarchical menu, the user can easily go back and forth between <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 18</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 19</ref>, just by dragging the mouse horizontally. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RELATED WORK</head><p>Many visualization and interaction techniques have been proposed for browsing and filtering large data. Examples include Xerox PARC's Information Visualizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and TableLens <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, nonlinear magnification systems like Generalized Fisheye Views <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Graphical Fisheye Views <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and Hyperbolic Visualizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, visualization systems using fractal <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, 2D zooming systems like Pad <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and Pad++ <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, 2D/3D zooming information retrieval system like the WING system <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, various information visualization systems developed at University of Maryland including FilmFinder <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, etc. and most of the systems supports methods for browsing the whole data, methods for filtering the data, and methods for showing the focal point while retaining the context.</p><p>Although these techniques are useful in various application domains, they tend to be special to particular applications, or their interaction method is completely different from existing GUI tools, as we have shown in Section 1. Also, most of the techniques are not applicable to visualizing simple list of many number of items.</p><p>On the other hand, LensBar is a simple extension to conventional slider and scrolling window, and its appearance and interaction method are not very different from conventional GUI tools. In spite of that, LensBar provides many powerful mechanisms for browsing and filtering a large list of items.</p><p>Various extensions to conventional sliders have been proposed. With AlphaSlider <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, users can control the sensitivity of the slider knob by clicking different portion of the knob. FineSlider <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> also enables users to move the slider knob precisely, and LensBar is taking the same approach.</p><p>Furnas <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> argued that appropriate data structure is necessary for navigating in a large data set, and as an example, he proposed adding a tree structure for the efficient view traversal of a large list. LensBar's assignment of DOI values yields the same effect, without using an additional tree structure.</p><p>LensBar's method of using the background of the slider is somewhat similar to Eick's "data visualization slider" <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> in that both of them are trying to make more use of the screen real estate. Although data visualization slider is useful for visualizing a large list, supported user operations are very different from conventional sliders and should be considered as a completely different visualization tool. Filtering and zooming are not supported in the data visualization slider. Chimera's ValueBars <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> is an approach to display additional information of the list items in adjacent to a conventional slider. This technique is useful in browsing various attributes of listed items, and it would be interesting to add similar features to LensBar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>We introduced a new powerful visualization and filtering technique called the LensBar. Although LensBar looks and acts very much like a conventional scroll window with a slider, its filtering and zooming mechanism makes various sophisticated interaction possible. LensBar can be used in wide range of applications which handle any kind of large lists, ranging from text browsers to hierarchical menus.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Scrolling the window DOI value Entry ... ...</figDesc></figure>
