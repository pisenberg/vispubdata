				<p>Existing treemap layout algorithms suffer to some extent from poor or inconsistent mappings between data order and visual ordering in their representation, reducing their cognitive plausibility. While attempts have been made to quantify this mismatch, and algorithms proposed to minimize inconsistency, solutions provided tend to concentrate on one-dimensional ordering. We propose extensions to the existing squarified layout algorithm that exploit the two-dimensional arrangement of treemap nodes more effectively. Our proposed spatial squarified layout algorithm provides a more consistent arrangement of nodes while maintaining low aspect ratios. It is suitable for the arrangement of data with a geographic component and can be used to create tessellated cartograms for geovisualization. Locational consistency is measured and visualized and a number of layout algorithms are compared. CIELab color space and displacement vector overlays are used to assess and emphasize the spatial layout of treemap nodes. A case study involving locations of tagged photographs in the Flickr database is described.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The use of treemaps, first proposed by Shneiderman <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, to represent hierarchical data has received wide attention in the information visualization community <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Their compact use of graphical space, reduced graphical complexity, relative ease of computation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> as well as some high profile examples (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>) have all contributed to their popularity. Yet they have also received criticism for their lack of cognitive plausibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, poorly perceived aesthetic qualities <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and poor task-driven performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper we address some of the weaknesses of existing treemap layout algorithms and presentation conventions by focussing on node placement. Our aim is to use location (a ratio-scale property) to represent relationships within hierarchical levels to produce 'richer and less opaque' representations and address concerns relating to the cognitive plausibility of treemaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. In doing so, we produce treemaps that may be used more effectively for answering queries that involve identifying relationships and trends within datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">ORDERED LAYOUTS</head><p>Nodes in a treemap represent individual data items in some dataset and their size, color and text label can be used to represent attributes of the data item. The topological relationship with higher level containing nodes is used to show the item's position in the hierarchy. However in most treemaps, the node's position does not precisely represent any charactersitic of the data. This is a potential waste of the information carrying capacity of the treemap and can also reduce the clarity of the representation by violating the distance-similarity metaphor <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> (the same data can be represented in arbitrarily different looking treemaps depending on the ordering of nodes).</p><p>The problem is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Here, 256 nodes of unit size are arranged using the squarified layout <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> that attempts to minimise aspect ratios. Nodes are approximately ordered from top-left to bottom-right. To search for a node early in the sequence (dark green), we would need to look somewhere towards the top or left. However the relationship between node order and distance from the top-left is not a simple one in this layout <ref type="figure">(Figure 1b)</ref>. In this example nodes 0-15 show a consistent linear relationship between order and distance. However the next node in sequence, node 16 is as close to the corner as node 1. These large jumps in distance-node order relationship make locating a given node more difficult. Spatial discontinuities also make it difficult</p><p>• Jo Wood (jwo@soi.city.ac.uk) and Jason <ref type="bibr">Dykes (jad7@soi.city.ac.uk</ref> to infer node order directly from location without significant cognitive effort and so impede efforts to identify relationships and trends. Bederson et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> attempted to address an aspect of this problem by considering various ordered layout algorthims where "items that are next to each other in the input to the algorithm are adjacent in the treemap" <ref type="bibr">[2, p.836]</ref>. They recognized that the linear ordering of nodes could be used to emphasize trends in a dataset as well as aid navigation through it. They proposed a metric, readability, that attempted to quantify the ease with which an ordered sequence could be followed in a treemap. This was measured by counting the number of abrupt angular changes (of more than 6 degrees) required when moving in sequence though a set of ordered sibling nodes. While this measure identifies angular change, it does not take into account the distance of separation between adjacent nodes, nor the consistency with which position relates to order. This is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, which shows four layouts of 16 ordered unit-sized nodes and their respective readability scores. No angular change is required to proceed from node 1 to node 16 in the slice and dice layout, so it receives a maximum readability score of 1. The strip layout <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> only requires a change in direction when proceeding from one row to the next, so receives the second highest readability score. The squarifed <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> layout requires angular changes that increase in frequency towards the end of the node list. The fourth layout, here termed ordered squarified requires some form of angular change between almost all nodes, so receives the lowest readability score. However there is a consistency in this fourth layout not possessed by the strip or squarified layouts that shows a gradual decrease in node rank from top-left to bottom-right.</p><p>Tu and Shen <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, attempted to give greater importance to twodimensional position by overlaying some known image (they used a map of the United States) on the treemap. This image was then distorted according to changes in treemap node size. They argued that knowledge of how and where the image has been distorted can be used to assess node change visually. However, this technique provides a rather loose and arbitrary coupling between node location and distorted image.</p><p>The differences in approach to layout strategies is in part a function of the fact that two-dimensional space is being used to represent a one-dimensional sequence of data items (such as time series, alphabetical ordering or size ordering). This is a specific case of a more general problem of representing one-dimensional sequences of data in two-dimensional graphical space <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Existing layout algorithms can tolerate this mis-match between data dimension and representation dimension if the queries they attempt to facilitate are of the form "where is node x?", but only then if there is some form of secondary ability to identify a node once it is found (e.g. a text label). However, queries of the form "where is the nth node in the sequence?" are more difficult due to the mixing of one-dimensional vertical and horizontal ordering  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">6  7  8  3  14  15   24   25   26   27   28   29   30   34  35  36  37  38  43  44  45   53   54   55   56   57   58   59   62  63  64  65  66  71  72  73   80   81   82   83   84   85   86   88  89  90  91  92  97  98  99   105   106   107   108   109   110   111   12  113  114  115  116  21  122  123   24   25   26   27   128   129   130   131   132   133   134   135  136  137  138  43  144  145   146   147   148   149   150   151   152   153   154   155   156  157  158  63  164  165   166   167   168   169   170   171   172   173   174   175  176  81  182  183   184   185   186   187   188   189   190   191   192  97  198  199   200   201   202   203   204   205   206   207  208  209  210  211  212  213   214   215   216   217   218   219   220  221  222  223  224  225   226   227   228   229   230   231  232  233  234  235   236   237   238   239   240  241  242  243   244   245   246   247  248  249   250   251   252  253   254  255   R 2 = 0.5428   0   100   200   300   400   500   600   700   800   900   0  16  32  48  64  80  96  112  128  144 160  176  192 208  224</ref>  in two-dimensional space. This in turn makes it more difficult to support queries that relate node order to some other variable attached to each node (e.g."What is the relationship between stock value and recent stock growth" in a treemap that orders and sizes nodes by stock value and colors them according to change over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>). We therefore propose a new layout algorithm, the ordered squarified layout that attempts to order nodes with two-dimensional consistency by relating node order to Euclidean distance from the parent node's top-left corner (here termed its origin). It is based on the squarified layout algorithm of Bruls et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, but additionally associates a two-dimensional location with each node. For a sorted set s of n ordered nodes that must be laid out inside a containing rectangle r, each node is given a location according to the algorithm AllocatePosition: The process of allocating locations that are exactly equally spaced within r yet cover it comprehensively is a non-trivial one, as it is essen-tially a two-dimensional circle packing problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. However, since the algorithm only requires rank order of location sorted by distance from origin, and since nodes of different sizes will only be approximately placed at their nominal location, an approximate tessellation proves adequate by calculating the average distance d between nodes. The function sortByDistance() simply sorts the newly created positions according to their Euclidean distance from the origin (r.x, r.y). An example applied to 10 nodes within a square is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> .  The orderedSquarified layout proceeds recursively as in the original squarified layout, but instead of selecting each node in turn from an ordered list of nodes, it selects the node closest to the current position in the enclosing rectangle. Every time a new node is added, the current position is moved d units right or down depending on whether nodes are being laid out horizontally or vertically. After each call to layoutrow() in Bruls' squarified algorithm, AllocatePosition() is called again to reposition the remaining nodes within the remaining rectangular space. The layout applied to nodes of equal size inside a square parent is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. Summary statistics for four layout algorithms applied to 100 equally sized nodes are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>. The metric distance correlation is simply the R 2 Pearson Product-Moment correlation coefficient between node order and node distance from the origin. It gives an indication of the order-distance consistency of nodes, although it must be recognized that this relationship is likely to be a non-linear one, so the measure only gives an approximate indication of consistency. Compared with the squarified layout of the same set of nodes ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>), there is greater positional consistency while low aspect ratios are retained. The slice and dice layout has greater consistency still, but as has been widely recognized, the poor aspect ratios it produces can make visual comparison difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Function AllocatePosition (s,r) { float d ←</formula><p>Laying out nodes of equal size, especially when the number of nodes is a perfect square, provides a best-case for both aspect ratio and distance consitency. Most real-world treemaps size nodes according to some interval or ratio-scale measurement, so to test the suitability of Tthe squarified layout appears to change approximately half way along its length (node 24) as the aspect ratio in which to fit remaining nodes changes from a horizontal rectangle to being approximately square. the ordered squarified layout, sets of randomly sized nodes were created. Each treemap consisted of 100 nodes each given a random size drawn from a log normal distribution, consistent with the simulations reported in <ref type="table">Table II</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Nodes were laid out using the squarified, or-deredSquarified, slice and dice and strip (with lookahead) algorithms, and the layout statistics calculated. The simulation was repeated 1000 times, taking the mean layout statistic for all realizations. The results are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>. An example set of nodes from this simulation, laid out with the squarified and orderedSquarified algorithms inside a rectangle of aspect ratio 2 is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> reveal that the orderedSquarified layout results in greater position-order consistency than both the squarified and strip layouts. Its readability score is significantly lower, so it may not be a suitable layout for queries of categorical data in the form of "where is node x?", but it may be more suitable for queries that are concerned with ordered trends and general comparison between node positions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> also illustrates a problem with the squarified layout where an arbitrary change in positioning of nodes occurs at the point when the space remaining in an enclosing rectangle changes from a rectangular to square aspect ratio. Nodes 1-24 in the squarified layout are ordered in adjacent vertical columns, nodes 25-100 follow an alternating horizontal and vertical arrangement. This can create the false impression of a bimodal distribution of sizes. The orderedSquarified layout shows a more continuous transition across this boundary, thus avoiding this problematic artifact of the squarified layout.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">SPATIAL LAYOUT AND DISPLACEMENT</head><p>The orderedSquarified layout is an attempt to provide a more consistent mapping of one-dimensional ordering into two-dimensional space. But potentially of more use is a layout that maps two- dimensional orderings into two-dimensional space. In particular, the mapping of hierarchical spatial data. We propose here a new spatial layout that attempts to position each node as closely as possible to its geographic location while minimizing its aspect ratio. The HistoMap layout of Mansmann et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> uses a variation of the pivot layout <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> to place nodes according to their position relative to the pivot in their parent node. Here we propose an alternative strategy that is a refinement of the orderedSquarified layout. It simply replaces the function AllocatePosition(s,r) with one that allocates a position according to each node's geographic location rather than an arbitrary evenly spaced position. An example of the spatial layout is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref> where the 95 departements of France are represented as nodes with minimized aspect ratio and spatial layout. The treemap is, in effect, a space filling cartogram <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> that may be combined with non-spatial hierarchical data (as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>) or used to display a spatial hierarchy such as post codes or census enumeration districts.</p><p>Clearly there is some spatial distortion required to tesselate the enclosing space, but the objective of the layout algorithm is to preserve the relative spatial arrangement of nodes as best possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Coloring of Absolute Position</head><p>A spatial layout of nodes will attempt to preserve their relative spatial positioning, but since they are always scaled to fit inside an enclosing rectangle, shows very little of their absolute location. So it is possible for two sets of sibling nodes to be arranged in their respective enclosing rectangles in a similar fashion even if the absolute locations of the two sets are different. For some geographic interpretation, knowledge of absolute location may be beneficial (see Section 4 below). We therefore propose using a two-dimensional color mapping of location in addition to a spatial layout where absolute location is important.</p><p>Two-dimensional color schemes are less common than their threedimensional counterparts (e.g. HSV, RGB, CIE, and XYZ) largely due to the trichromacy of normal human color perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Projecting color space into two dimensions while retaining a broad color range and preserving some systematic 2D color coordinate system is challenging. While guidance exists on bi-variate color schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, there is evidence that cognition of bi-variate color mappings of two data dimensions is problematic <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. The cases where two-dimensional schemes are used tend to be reprojections of threedimensional space for automated pattern recognition rather than human perception (e.g. scene object detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>; skin and face recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>), or for selected applications where a restricted color range is required (e.g. cartographic shaded relief <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>). However, we hypothesize that the similarity of easting and northing as data dimensions may make perception of bi-variate coloring a less cognitively arduous task. We have therefore adopted a two-dimensional transect though uniform three-dimensional color space. We propose use of the CIELa*b* color space that attempts to provide a perceptually uniform gamut <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> , holding L (equivalent to lightness) constant, and using the a* and b* axes to represent eastings and northings respectively.</p><p>The optimal scaling, translation and orientation of the a* and b* axes with respect to geographical coordinates will depend on the shape of geographical space and the most important regions of interest to be shown using the color space. The aim is to produce as discriminating a color variation as possible over the region of interest. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref> shows a transformation developed for the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain National Grid. Outlying locations may be mapped to their nearest valid color value (e.g. the Orkney and Shetland islands in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7)</ref>. The coloring scheme is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref>, which shows how a uniform distribution of grid squares over the landmass of Great Britain is represented as a non-hierarchical spatial treemap using the CIELab coloring scheme. Regions of color discontinuity can be seen where the landmass is least rectangular in shape (e.g. between North Wales and South West Scotland, and the far North East of Scotland).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Identifying Displacement</head><p>Forcing most spatial arrangements of nodes into a rectangle will clearly result in some form of spatial displacement of their original georeferenced location. As has been suggested above, this displacement may be amplified if it is also a goal to produce reasonably square treemap nodes. To evaluate the spatial integrity of the spatial layout algorithm and address concerns regarding the consistency of distortion <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, a number of numeric and visual indicators of distortion may be considered. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Numeric Measures</head><p>An obvious numeric metric is the average distance by which nodes have been displaced in order to tessellate their enclosing rectangle. This was calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">disp DIST = ∑ n i=1 d i n √ A root<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Where d i is the Euclidean distance between each node's treemap centroid and its affine transformed geographic location (to fit inside its enclosing node), n is the number of nodes and A root is the area of the root node. This provides a dimensionless ratio scaled between 0 (no spatial displacement) and 1 (maximum possible displacement). d i is always calculated relative to each node's immediate parent node so as to avoid double counting of nodes which may be displaced simply because their parent was itself displaced.</p><p>Average length of displacement hides other potentially important geographical relationships. For example, it is possible to displace two nodes by only a small amount, but to change their topological and directional relationship with each other. Likewise, nodes may be displaced by large amounts, but if many local nodes are all displaced together, their spatial relationship with each other may be preserved. Therefore, to complement the distance displacement measure, we can quantify the angular displacement between pairs of nodes. This can be calculated by taking the average angular deviation between pairs of nodes in treemap space and the same pairs in geographic space:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">disp ANG = 1 n 2 n ∑ i=1 n ∑ j=1 acos u i j u i j • v i j v i j (2)</formula><p>where u i j is the vector between each leaf node and each of its sibling leaves in treemap space, v i j is the same vector in geographic space and n is the number of sibling leaves. The measure is scaled between 0 (no angular distortion by the treemap) and 180 • (equivalent of rotating the geographic space by 180 • about its centre).</p><p>Both the distance and angular metrics can be used to compare different spatial arrangements of the same set of nodes, but should be used with more caution when comparing different sets of nodes since average displacement will depend in part on how regularly spaced the geographic locations of sibling nodes are. These displacement metrics provide a useful indicator of average distortion and were used to <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Layout statistics for spatial layouts of trial datasets. 'Simulation' represents the mean of 1000 realizations of 100 log-normal randomly sized nodes with Gaussian locations; 'France' represents the 95 departements shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>; 'OSGB' represents the Ordnance Survey National Grid squares shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref>; 'US Population' represents the US states sized according to population shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref>. compare the effect of minor changes to the spatial layout algorithm as well as comparison with the geographic HistoMap layout of Mansmann et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The results for the spatial layout and the HistoMap for simulated and real geographic datasets are shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Both spatial layout algorithms perform best on distributions of nodes that are more regularly spaced and evenly sized (e.g. France and OSGB). The simulation datasets were deliberately constructed to challenge the layout algorithms, with a Gaussian spatial distribution giving rise to a highly dense central region of nodes that require significant displacement to tesselate. The average aspect ratios for these data were sufficiently low to allow area-based comparisons, although the average figure does hide some small nodes with very poor aspect ratios. Distance displacement is poorer for the HistoMap layout than the spatial layout, but angular displacement much poorer for the HistoMap layout. This suggests that for spatial distributions with high central densities and few spatial outliers, the spatial layout may be more appropriate. Distance and angular displacement tends to be slightly better when applying the HistoMap layout to France and the US Population. This appears to be due to the fact that this layout (based on the pivot algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>) processes central nodes first and so is less affected by irregular peripheral distributions (e.g. the Brittany peninsular of NW France and the small population states of the E and NE United States).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dataset Layout</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Graphical Indicators</head><p>Numerical measures provide some insight into the qualities of the spatial tesselation of nodes, but they may fail to detect some systematic distortions that can result in misleading interpretations. We therefore propose using a visual indication of distance, directional, and topological distortion of geographic nodes by overlaying displacement vectors on the treemap. The displacement vector connects each treemap node to its affine transformed geographic location. In order to avoid cluttering the visual display, the quadratic Bezier arrow technique of Fekete et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> was adopted. Here the connecting vector is represented as a curve with greater curvature at the treemap node end of the line. Unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, we set a single Bezier control point to 60 • to the right of the vector, at a distance of 25% of the vector length giving a straighter line than Fekete et al proposed. This tends to keep the displacement vector within the bounds of the enclosing rectangle while still indicating the direction of the displacement. By having the maximum curvature at the treemap node end of the vector, a stronger visual indicator of any spatial clustering is given. For treemaps with relatively small numbers of nodes, these vectors can be used as additional references to aid interpretation. For those with many nodes, the vectors can be used to give a general impression of where spatial distortion is greatest and weakest. They also provide additional information on the geographic layout of data while still allowing interpretation of the treemap hierarchy <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref> shows the displacement vectors for a non-hierarchical car-togram of the United States. The vectors distinguish between the western states where displacement in the treemap is uniformly towards the SE and the more complex distortion of the Eastern states where larger differences in size (population) and spatial distribution lead to some crossing vectors. In any variation of the squarified layout, relatively large nodes tend to force themselves towards the edge of their enclosing rectangle. This is because once a large node has been added, further smaller nodes added to the same row or column would have a very high aspect ratio and are therefore rejected. This is a problem for geographic patterns where the variable mapped to size is greatest towards the geographic centre of the space being mapped and significantly smaller at the periphery (see, for example, the effect of Michigan on Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Delaware in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref>).  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 10</ref> shows the 2860 landmass nodes of the OSGB 10km grid squares laid out with the spatial and HistoMap algorithms. The distortion vectors provide a visual indication of where displacement is greatest and where it is most inconsistent. Crossing vectors result in darker regions and show where there is inconsistency in spatial distortion. By combining the images with the CIELab coloring of absolute position, artifacts of the pivoting process in the HistoMap layout can be seen as discontinuities of color at 1/2 n intervals. When used in a hierarchical treemap this has the potential to be confused with genuine hierarchical classification of data. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CASE STUDY: PHOTOGRAPH METADATA ANALYSIS</head><p>To explore the suitability of ordered treemaps for information visualization we have applied both the spatial and ordered squarified layouts to the analysis of photographic landscape image retrieval. The work is built upon the research problem and approach identified by Edwardes and Purves <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and Dykes et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> who investigated the metadata people choose to attach to photographic images of landscape when submitted to public image archives. The purpose was to try to identify how place is captured in volunteered geographic information <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. This work attempted to classify photographs according to scene types which were further subclassified into scene type descriptors, derived from the Pansofsky-Shatford facet matrix for image classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and Smith and Mark's geographical kinds <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. These classes were extracted by performing textual analysis on photograph metadata such as titles, descriptions, tags and comments <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Because each photograph was of a located scene, part of that analysis involved investigating geographic patterns in the way photographs are described.</p><p>The Flickr photo sharing service (www.flickr.com) was used to extract the metadata for all photos that had been geolocated in the British Isles and contained at least one of the following scene types as tags: mountain, hill, village, beach. Photos were then subclassified according to scene types divided into the following classes: elements (nouns such as peak, church, sand), qualities (usually adjectives such as cold, green, rural), and activities (verbs such as walking, surfing, fishing). Selecting only photos with a geolocation accuracy of approximately 5km or better (Flickr accuracy levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and filtering out those with 'tag spam', resulted in a set of50,000 photographs tagged by the four scene types. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 11</ref> shows the spatial treemap of these data selecting the 10 most frequent scene type descriptors for each category of scene type descriptor in each scene type. This yields a tree structure of depth 3, with 4 categories at the first level, 12 at the second and 120 at the third.</p><p>Positioning of non-leaf nodes gives a general view of relative geographical patterns in subject matter and tagging behavior. So, for example, photos tagged with 'mountain' tend to be further north-west than those tagged with 'hill'. Color can be used to identify the degree to which such relationships exist, for example that 'beach/surfing' tends to have a greater proportion of photographs in the SW than 'beach/waves'. The displacement vector overlays in this context indicate the geographic concentration of photographs. This is most clearly seen in the 'sea' nodes where photos are inevitably concentrated around the UK coastline. The 'beach/pier' node shows the dominance of Brighton pier in the south-east. The size of non-leaf nodes gives an indication of relative popularity of tag styles. So for example, elements are more common than qualities and activities for all scene types, with the contrast being strongest in photographs tagged with 'beach'. Activity tags are more common than quality tags for hills and mountains but not for villages and beaches. The combination of vector overlay and coloring of leaf nodes is useful in identifying where individual contributions or events can dominate a pattern (and could therefore be filtered out in further analysis). For example, the brown 'car', 'hillclimb', 'racing' and 'carracing' tags in the 'hill' scene type are dominantly taken by an individual at the Prescott Hill motor racing circuit in Southern England.</p><p>It is possible that direct analysis of submitted photographs in addation to their volunteered metadata may help to identify what it is that contributors use to define place. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 12</ref> shows the mean image color of each of the 50,000 photographs classified by scene type and scene type descriptor. Using the spatial layout it is possible to explore whether there are any geographic patterns in this color variation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 12</ref> suggests that scene type descriptor is probably more strongly correlated with photo color than geography (e.g. hills are greener than any other scene type; most color quality tags are associated with the color they describe, but 'white' and 'light' tagged photos appear darker than 'black' tagged photos. Where spatial layout does play a useful role is in identifying spatially clustered photos of a similar average color. These tend to be multiple photographs submitted by the same contributor of the same event.</p><p>Some caution needs to be exercised in assessing assemblages of colored pixels though, as the ordering itself can affect the impression of the distribution of colors. The six treemaps shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 13</ref> all show exactly the same data, but re-ordered according to different criteria and layout algorithms. The top row of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 13</ref> shows a subgraph of the tree where leaf nodes have been ordered using the or-deredSquarified layout. In each of the three examples, the same set of mean colors have been ordered according to the 3 principal components of the RGB color space. The first component is approximately a transect though color value, the second along a blue-orange transect and the third along a green-magenta transect. A very different visual impression of the same set of colors can be given simply by changing the (arbitrary) ordering of colored nodes. The bottom row shows the same nodes ordered by just the first principal component of color, but laid out using the squarified, pivot by middle and strip map algorithms. In each of these cases, discontinuities in color can be seen that don't reflect properties of the data, but rather artifacts of the layout algorithm. These include localized clusters of orange and blue nodes, diagonal clusters of dark pixels and apparently nested square clusters that simply reflect the pivot points used in the layout algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>We have proposed a pair of new algorithms that attempt to increase the cognitive plausibility of treemap layouts by relating the twodimensional positioning of nodes in a treemap more closely to the properties of the data they represent. While attempts to do this have been made in the past, most notably by Bederson et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, they have tended to focus on the problem of identifying a particular node within an ordered list. In our work, we have attempted to lay out nodes to allow trends and comparisons between nodes to be made. The geography of data is one obvious example, exploited by our spatial lay-out, where location is an important property that should be reflected in the information graphic. Where geographic information is not available, we argue that the ordered squarified layout follows the distancesimilarity metaphor more closely by minimizing arbitrary spatial discontinuities that do not reflect properties of the data. We have considered a number of metrics that might be used to measure the success of a layout algorithm. We argue that readability, while summarizing the cognitive effort required to follow an ordered sequence of nodes, does not necessarily reflect the effort required to assess trends or comparisons between nodes. Instead we have used correlation between node order and distance from the origin of a parent node. For spatial layout of data with a geographic component, measures of distance and angular displacement can be used to assess the degree to which the treemap reflects the spatial properties of the data it represents. This has allowed us to make comparisons between our spatial layout and the HistoMap layout <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, identifying the types of spatial pattern that are best represented by each layout. Yet summary statistics of overall spatial distortion or consistency fail to detect the impact of discontinuities in layout. These may be better reflected by graphical means such as displacement vectors and spatial coloring. We have used these techniques to identify the spatial patterns and complex geographies of volunteered photographic metadata as well as drawing attention to the advantages of the spatial layout over pivotbased algorithms.</p><p>Further developments of this work include the identification of more discriminating metrics of layout inconsistency. In particular, measures that identify systematic but arbitrary discontinuities in layout. These might include geometric inconsistencies as well as topological ones. Suitable metrics may help in refining the layout algorithms to better reflect the geographic distributions of the data they represent.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Fig. 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Ten nodes located after spacing them within their containing rectangle.
