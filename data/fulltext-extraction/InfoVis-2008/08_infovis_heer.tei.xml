				<p>Interactive history tools, ranging from basic undo and redo to branching timelines of user actions, facilitate iterative forms of interaction. In this paper, we investigate the design of history mechanisms for information visualization. We present a design space analysis of both architectural and interface issues, identifying design decisions and associated trade-offs. Based on this analysis, we contribute a design study of graphical history tools for Tableau, a database visualization system. These tools record and visualize interaction histories, support data analysis and communication of findings, and contribute novel mechanisms for presenting, managing, and exporting histories. Furthermore, we have analyzed aggregated collections of history sessions to evaluate Tableau usage. We describe additional tools for analyzing users&apos; history logs and how they have been applied to study usage patterns in Tableau.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>When investigating data with visualizations, users regularly traverse the space of views in an iterative fashion. Exploratory analysis may result in a number of hypotheses, leading to multiple rounds of question-answering. Analysts can generate unexpected questions that may be investigated immediately or revisited later. After conducting analysis, users may need to review, summarize, and communicate their findings, often in the form of reports or presentations.</p><p>By surfacing users' interaction history, we can facilitate analysis and communication. History mechanisms such as undo or "timetravel" enable revisitation in a variety of applications (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[1-4, 6, 8, 12-14, 16-20, 22, 24-26]</ref>). As noted by Shneiderman <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, such history tools can play an important part in the visualization process, supporting iterative analysis by enabling users to review, retrieve, and revisit visualization states. Moreover, history tools can help users create reports or presentations, facilitating communication.</p><p>Interaction histories can also benefit research and development. History log analysis of both individual and aggregate usage can identify common usage patterns and thereby assist usability evaluation. Researchers can also study interaction patterns to better understand and model analysts' sense-making process <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>However, the best history mechanisms for achieving these benefits are not always clear. Designers of visualization tools must consider a large design space of potential features and system architectures when designing history tools. These design decisions entail trade-offs in the types of history representations and operations that can be provided.</p><p>For example, while it is easy to log low-level input events such as key presses and mouse clicks <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, users can more readily take advantage of semantically meaningful models. Many operations might be performed on an interaction history, including editing, aggregation, bookmarking, annotation, and search. Architecture and interface design need to account for such operations. Furthermore, interaction histories can grow large quickly, and thus history mechanisms must scale accordingly. Scale concerns arise at the data level, where histories can benefit from compact description, and at the visual level, where history interfaces should be perceptually effective and space efficient.</p><p>In this paper, we explore the design of graphical history tools to support visual analysis. We first present the results of a design space analysis, enumerating design decisions for the software architecture and graphical interface of history systems. Our analysis is intended to provide an overview of important design considerations and thereby help practitioners incorporate graphical history tools into their own visualization applications.</p><p>Inspired by our design space analysis, we then present the design and implementation of graphical history tools to support analysis, communication, and evaluation in Tableau, a database visualization system <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Although our primary contribution is a design study of history tools for visual analysis, our graphical history prototype also contributes new techniques for improving scalability, searching histories for relevant views, and generating presentations from history subsets. Furthermore, we have used our history model to support evaluation by analyzing recorded usage data. We describe our visual history analysis tools and how we have applied them to improve Tableau's user interface. We also calculate estimates of the impact of our history management techniques, finding that our techniques can reduce visualized history state spaces by over 60%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">DESIGN SPACE ANALYSIS OF INTERACTION HISTORIES</head><p>Architects of interactive history systems face a number of design decisions impacting the representations and operations available to users. To design our history tools, we first conducted a design space analysis to enumerate these decisions. We surveyed prior work spanning general history mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> and interface designs in the areas of graphical design tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, web browsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, and visualization and simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. In this section, we outline the design space of history tools using examples from this body of work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">History Models</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Actions vs. States</head><p>We model interaction histories as movement through a graph of application states. Nodes in the graph represent discrete states of the application and edges represent the actions that transform one state into another. A state is defined by the settings of interface widgets and the application content (e.g., document, data, etc architectural level, developers must decide if their history system will maintain sequences of states, actions, or both, and how such history items-discrete representations of an action or historical state-will be organized. Action logging is often referred to as the command object model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Command objects encapsulate an interface action, typically providing both do and undo methods that apply the operation or its inverse. To traverse the history, a sequence of commands can either be done or undone in order. This approach requires that suitable inverse (undo) operations are defined for all actions.</p><p>An alternative is to log the individual states of the application. Traversing the history then involves restoring the application state to a stored configuration, removing the need to sequentially apply undo actions. However, the drawback of this approach is that the state representation can become memory inefficient.</p><p>The action and state approaches are not mutually exclusive and hybrid approaches are possible. For example, an action-based history mechanism might periodically cache the state to reduce the number of operations required by history traversal. A state model might also log metadata about the operations that were applied between states. For example, the WebQuilt web logging system <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> stores URLs (states) but also notes the index of the link clicked in the previous page, modelling web browsing at the level of individual links.</p><p>In surveying the literature, we have found that action logging is prevalent within graphic design tools, where large content models can make state models memory-inefficient. In contrast, state logging (as URLs) is common for web browsing histories. Visualization systems have utilized both approaches. As discussed later, this choice affects the range of history operations that users may perform, particularly with respect to editing and selective undo.</p><p>A common approach in visualization is to describe the visualization in terms of a chain of visual encoding operators that are applied to the data to generate the visualization state. Jankun-Kelly et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> introduce a general model for visualization state as a set of parameters, and actions as transformations of these parameters. Heer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> note that identical visualization views can be reached through different parameter sets. In particular, different filtering criteria may yield the same result set. Thus, accurate analysis of revisitation may require that state models include an index of the underlying content in addition to parameter settings.</p><p>One modelling issue specific to visualization is its data-driven nature: application states are dependent on the backing data set. If a visualized data set includes streaming or editable data, a faithful history system must also take the changes to the data into account. It may be that users want historical states to update with changes to the data, thereby keeping their analysis current (a form of selective redo, discussed later). If not, data management systems that support versioning or provenance may be used; however, such systems may entail an unacceptable storage cost. As a visualization view might depend only on a subset or aggregate of the backing data, in many cases creating an extract of the data for a "snapshot" of the visualization state may be a feasible solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">History Organization</head><p>History items may be organized in various ways. The stack model places items on both undo and redo stacks. This approach does not support branching histories, as the redo stack is cleared when new actions occur. A timeline model stores items in the linear order in which they occur. Branching models <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> store items in a tree structure, and actions performed after undo operations form a new branch of the tree. Additionally, history models may perform content indexing and organize history items by other metadata properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">Hierarchical Command Objects</head><p>Systems may represent history items at multiple granularities. For example, one can group a sequence of low-level actions into a higher-level action through hierarchical command objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>Grouped actions may provide a better semantic description of a user's intention. To construct groupings, developers can craft "chunking" rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> based on the type and timing of actions. However, groupings also raise challenges for representing and navigating hierarchical history items in a user-friendly manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4">Local and Global History</head><p>One can organize history items by the objects on which actions are performed. For example, a spreadsheet may maintain separate histories per worksheet, while a graphics editor could maintain local histories for objects in the scene. Edwards et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> propose a transactional model to support local histories in which actions may have global side-effects. In all cases, applications must support the ability to merge local histories into a global timeline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Visual Representations of History</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Visual Presentation</head><p>One simple presentation of a history item is a text description of the state or action, commonly found as menu text for undo and redo actions. Text descriptions should be easy to understand, and may require subtle design decisions. For example, web history systems have carefully considered different abbreviation approaches for web page titles and URLs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. While text may be helpful for describing actions performed in a visualization, they are less well suited for the graphical nature of a visualization state. Graphical representations of histories are also common. Some depictions involve abstract properties: for example, the color of a history item glyph might represent the type of action performed. Most common, however, are thumbnail images used to aid users' recognition of the previous interface state-an approach particularly relevant for visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Multiple studies have found benefits for thumbnails in web browsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, with one study suggesting that a thumbnail size of about 120 pixels square is enough to enable 80% accurate recognition of a visited web site <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Other projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> enhance thumbnails to improve comprehension by highlighting changes and applying strategic callouts and cropping.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Spatial Organization</head><p>Depending on the underlying history model, a number of visual organizations of history items are possible. A common approach is a linear sequence of items, like a comic strip <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Such an organization facilitates visual scanning of the history, and typically enables navigation by clicking an entry. A similar approach is to provide a continuous timeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, which shows the time duration between actions and is navigated using a slider control. Branching histories typically use a node-link tree diagram to show history branches. Prior work has adapted both the sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> and timeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> metaphors into branching tree displays. Klemmer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> present an inline branching design that places collapsible history branches within a linear comic strip.</p><p>Other representations are also possible. Behavior graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> are an alternative representation of branching histories that we will discuss in section 4.1. Another approach is to use a content-centric representation using variables other than time. WebQuilt <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> visualizes aggregate surfing behavior in a network diagram showing traversed links between web page thumbnails. Ma's Image Graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> display history states as thumbnails connected in a graph layout and depict actions between states using iconic edge representations. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.3</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Operations on History</head><p>Designers need to also consider the set of operations that their graphical history tools should support.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Navigation</head><p>For end-users, the fundamental operation of history systems is navigation to states in the history. Undo and redo (or back and forward) actions are common navigation operations found in many applications. Another approach is for users to click the thumbnail of a history state to directly return to that state. Some systems use a "time travel" metaphor with a timeline slider. For branching histories, a graphical history can help users differentiate branches. Content-based navigation is also possible, such as navigating to the point in time that an object was last edited <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Editable Histories</head><p>Other operations may involve editing the history, as users may wish to revise the history or replay past actions. In state-based history models, deleting a past state from the model doesn't affect any of the other states. In action-based models, editing has side-effects. Deleting a past action involves rolling back the history prior to the selected action and re-applying the subsequent actions. However, some subsequent actions may be dependent on a side-effect of the deleted action, so rules to ensure integrity are needed. While history editing is more complicated for action-based models, it enables unique operations. Selective undo <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> allows the replay of past actions after revising the history. Similarly, selective redo <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> allows chains of actions to be copied and reused. Kurlander and Feiner <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> use this mechanism to support macro creation. For example, a sequence of visualization transforms might be re-applied to a new subset of data <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Metadata and Annotation</head><p>Users may also wish to add metadata and annotations to history items. Bookmarking <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, keyword tagging, text comments <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, and audio annotations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> are all potentially useful. Usage scenarios for visualization include analysts creating bookmarks for important findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, leaving text notes to describe a view to a collaborator <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and recording audio annotations to aid "think-aloud" evaluation protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4">Search and Filter</head><p>As histories grow large, users may need means beyond visual search and scrolling to find past states of interest. Search tools are one solution. Metadata such as time, action type, bookmarks, and annotations are all potential search domains. Although filtering tools have been provided for web design histories <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, most visualization histories <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> lack search capabilities. A notable exception is VisTrails <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, which enables querying-by-example to find related visual exploration sessions across multiple users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.5">Export</head><p>To enable communication, it is often important to export and share parts of a history. For web-based systems, one can distribute a URL <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, but desktop applications are typically more cumbersome. Klemmer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> print out thumbnails and text annotations as paper reports. However, nearly all history tools are lacking more nuanced support for exporting histories into external media.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Summary</head><p>In this section, we have categorized a range of design decisions that arise when crafting an interactive history system. These decisions include how to represent and organize historical data (e.g., states, actions, or both), how to visually present histories (e.g., linear or branching layout), and what interactive operations the history should support (e.g., navigation, editing, search, and export). Still, the task remains of deciding which route to take when designing a system. The features and context of use of the underlying visual analysis tool can further inform the design process for history tools. To illustrate this process, we now apply our design space analysis to develop an interactive history system in the context of Tableau, a database visualization system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">GRAPHICAL HISTORY IN TABLEAU: A CASE STUDY</head><p>Based on the considerations raised by our design space analysis, we designed a history interface supporting analysis and communication in Tableau, a commercial visual analysis system. We now describe Tableau and present the design of our graphical history tools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The Tableau Visual Analysis System</head><p>Tableau is a commercial system, based on Polaris <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, for visualizing the contents of databases. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>, the Tableau interface includes a list of available database fields and a workspace in which users can select fields and drag them onto shelves corresponding to visual encodings such as position, color, shape, and size. Tableau is based on a specification language called VizQL. VizQL statements are generated from the contents of the interface shelves and they specify both the data that should be visualized (as database query statements) and how the visualization should appear (as visual specification statements). This formalism supports a range of visualizations, including bar charts, time series, scatter plots, and heat maps, as well as analytic operations such as filtering, sorting, and drill-down <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Akin to Microsoft Excel, Tableau supports multiple worksheets. Each state of a Tableau worksheet is described by a VizQL statement. Tableau's original history model used a state-based logging approach, with each worksheet organizing VizQL statements on undo and redo stacks. This model does not support branching histories, except through duplication of worksheets. Undo and redo buttons provide some support for history navigation, but the model does not provide text descriptions for undo/redo actions. In the following sub-sections, we describe a redesigned model to better support analysis and communication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">A Re-designed History Model</head><p>In crafting a history model for Tableau, we wanted to maintain the existing, clean approach of declaratively modeling state as VizQL statements. However, VizQL statements alone are not enough, as we also wanted to record historical data that enables us to provide highlevel descriptions of user actions, both to provide a more informative user interface and to support usage evaluation. As a result, our improved history model uses a hybrid state/action approach as identified in our design space analysis. History items in Tableau still record states as VizQL statements, but we also introduced aspects of action-based logging. We created a classification scheme for each action supported by the interface. When an action occurs, its unique identifier and any arguments are passed to the history system, which stores the command description and the current VizQL statement as a history item. Having a record of actions allows us to create text descriptions, improving the cues for undo and redo within the interface. Our classification scheme groups actions into five top-level categories: shelf (add, remove, replace), data (bin, derive field), analysis (filter, sort), worksheet (add, delete, duplicate), and formatting (resize, style) commands.</p><p>In addition to basic history items, our model supports composites of grouped sub-items, similar to hierarchical command objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. All history items support data fields such as a timestamp, bookmark status, and text annotations. We organize items in a branching structure for each worksheet, replacing the prior stack model. When a user visits a past state and performs an action, a new analysis branch is added to the model (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>). Our history abstraction also supports merged histories, implemented as a composite history view of worksheet histories. By default, the state model does not include the database contents and changes to the database will cause historical states to update to reflect the current data. However, users can create data extracts if desired, ensuring a static data set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.3</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design of the Graphical History Interface</head><p>We designed our history representation with the understanding that graphical history should aid analysis in an unobtrusive fashion. The visualization should serve as the primary focus of attention and the history as an auxiliary display. We wanted to ensure that the graphical history "pays for" its screen real estate, using only the space needed for effective presentation and navigation of history items.</p><p>As a result, the history model is depicted using a sequential, comic-strip display <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1, Fig. 2 bottom)</ref>, including a thumbnail image and text description for displayed history items. As tree diagrams can require a lot of screen space, we present branching histories inline: branch contents are listed sequentially, with sibling branches sorted by the timestamp of the first item. We position the history viewer along the bottom of the interface. Users can optionally hide the viewer to make more space for the visualization. Hovering the mouse pointer over a history item reveals a tooltip with detailson-demand <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2)</ref>. The tooltip lists the time the state was first visited in absolute and relative ("3 min ago") time. The tooltip includes text annotations added to the item and a summary of visual encodings: which data fields are placed on which shelves.</p><p>To maximize the usefulness of the history display, the interface provides four modes, accessible via a drop-down menu <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 3</ref>):</p><p>• Worksheets mode presents an overview of the current state of all worksheets, with a thumbnail and name for each <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2</ref>). • Worksheet History mode presents the history of a worksheet.</p><p>Thumbnails are captioned with action descriptions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1, 6</ref>). • All Histories mode is similar to Worksheet History mode but depicts the merged global history across all worksheets. • Bookmarks mode shows all views that have been bookmarked.</p><p>Captions include the source worksheet name and a timestamp.  The panel along the bottom shows an analysis history viewer, currently providing an overview of the current state of each worksheet. A tooltip provides details-on-demand for the selected history item. <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. Adjusting Thumbnail Contrast. The image on the left is an overview thumbnail generated by down-sampling that suffers from "wash out". On the right, high-frequency elements such as gridlines have been removed and pixel values are adjusted such that the data color in the image matches the color encoding palette.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Thumbnail Image Generation</head><p>The history viewer provides thumbnails of visualization states to aid recognition. Thumbnail size introduces a trade-off between screen usage and recognizability. Based on the experimental results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, we chose 120 pixels square. As noted by our design space analysis, some graphics editors <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> provide enhanced thumbnails that highlight differences between history states and perform selective cropping. As changes in Tableau regularly involve complete updates of the visualization, this approach did not seem appropriate. Views in Tableau often require scrolling, so we reasoned that a thumbnail that provides an overview of the display as well as historical data would be the most useful for facilitating analysis.</p><p>To generate the overview images we render the visualization at its native resolution and then scale the resulting image. We place limits on the image buffer size, cropping the image as needed to constrain memory usage. We also avoid extreme aspect ratios by non-uniformly scaling the image when needed. In some cases, downsampling a large overview can result in a "washed out" image. For large images, our thumbnail generation routine first modifies the visualization, removing high-frequency visual elements such as gridlines and element borders. In the resulting thumbnail, pixels with brightness over a threshold value are then scaled towards the nearest color in the color encoding palette (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Navigating and Managing History</head><p>By visualizing past analysis states, our graphical history display facilitates revisitation. Users can click a thumbnail to skip back to a prior state. If a user performs analysis operations while visiting a prior state, a new analysis branch is created and depicted in the graphical history. However, as these histories can quickly become unwieldy, we have implemented additional techniques to reduce the complexity of the display and filter unneeded views. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> depicts our model and how it is mapped into a visual display.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1">Manual Editing</head><p>We support manual editing so that users can delete unwanted states from the history. As we use state-based logging, deleted states are simply removed from their history branch and do not impose side effects on other history items. However, one caveat is that deletion can result in an incomplete timeline in Worksheet History mode, in which text descriptions of prior actions are provided.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2">Chunking</head><p>When a group of related actions are performed in sequence, they may be better represented as a single higher-level event. We have implemented three chunking rules based on empirical usage data, along with some exception cases. In an analysis of user activity (sec. 4.3.2), we found that rapid sequences of formatting actions are common and could benefit from aggregation. Accordingly, we include a rule that chunks history items if the most recent state was the result of a formatting operation. Similarly, a quick succession of sort or filter actions (less than 30 sec. apart) likely indicate a multi-step configuration of the view and are chunked together. A rapid series shelf actions to build up (or take down) a view are also common, and so we chunk them when separated by less than 5 sec. We also support exception cases: large time durations-possibly indicating a break between sessionsprevents any chunking, as does bookmarking or annotating a state.</p><p>When our rules determine that two actions should be chunked, the thumbnail in the history view updates in-place and no new thumbnails are added to the view. Users can click in the history view to skip to a state prior to the chunked sequence. However, undo events will step back through each of the chunked actions individually. We believe that this interaction is less complicated than an interface providing explicit level-of-detail controls (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.3">Undo-as-Delete</head><p>Undo actions may be the result of varied intentions. For example, an undo may be viewed as a navigation action, moving to a previous state with the intention of later rolling forward again. Alternatively, an undo may serve as a "delete" operation to recover from a mistake or an undesirable action. Similarly, Shipman and Hsieh <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> have argued that a quickly-made undo is probably a delete. In our effort to improve the scalability of graphical histories, we hypothesized that most uses of undo fall within the latter category, such that "undone" states are rarely revisited. As described in section 4.3.1, we empirically tested this idea, finding that undo actions were over 12 times more common than redo actions. As a result, we developed a new history management technique we call undo-as-delete. As a user performs actions, new items are added to the graphical history. When a user clicks the back button to perform an undo, the last state is removed from the graphical history. The underlying model still maintains the state, and thus subsequent redo actions work as expected, with the history item returned to the graphical history. However, if the user never executes a redo, the undone analysis branch is discarded as in a stack-based organization.</p><p>This approach enables unneeded history to be automatically culled, reducing the complexity of the history model. Branching histories can still be created by navigating to past states using the graphical history rather than the undo button. New actions will then result in a new branch without deleting the previous branch, thus preserving the analysis trail. Similarly, we automatically disable undo-as-delete if user interaction suggests a view is important. Bookmarking or annotating the current state exempts it and previous states on the same branch from deletion. In future research we plan to see if other indicators such as selections might prove desirable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.4">History Navigation and Management Example</head><p>Assume a user performs four actions in a row, as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>, to move through states A B C D E. The result is a linear list of states. The user then undoes the previous two actions, moving back to state C. Our undo-as-delete rules automatically hide states D and E to reduce the complexity of the history. The user next explores an alternative analysis, first skipping back to state A by clicking its thumbnail in the graphical history view, and then performing new operations to move through states A F G H. When the user performs a new operation to go to state F, the undo-as-delete rules delete states D and E from the underlying model. Furthermore, when chunking rules determine that states F and G are similar, they are coalesced into the single entry G in the graphical display. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5b</ref>, the abbreviated branch G H is presented in sequence after branch B C, as sibling branches are sorted by the timestamp of the first entry in the branch. Similarly, if the user were to skip back to state B and perform new actions, the new branch would be placed in the list sequence directly after state C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Operating on History</head><p>As discussed in our design space analysis, operations on history models can support sensemaking, search, and communication.</p><p>Guided by these concerns, we have incorporated operations for affixing metadata to history states, dynamic querying of the history interface, and exporting histories to support sharing and presentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.1">Metadata: Bookmarks and Annotations</head><p>By right-clicking an item, users are presented a context menu with which they can bookmark that state or add a text annotation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 6</ref>).</p><p>Bookmarked views are then available in the Bookmarks mode of the history viewer. We have also considered adding a keyword tagging feature; this could be achieved by generalizing the bookmarking feature to include user-provided text labels. Text annotations are available in tooltips when the mouse hovers over an item <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.2">Search and Filter</head><p>Even with mechanisms for combating scale (sec. 3.4), histories can grow large. To help retrieve states of interest, we have introduced multiple search features <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 6</ref>). We hypothesized that the type of visualization and the data fields used are salient aspects with which users might recall past states. Our history viewer supports filtering by data field by reusing the shelf metaphor for visual encodings. Users can simply drop a data field into the history filter shelf to limit the view to only those states that include the data field. A combo box allows users to further limit the history view to specific chart types <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 7)</ref>. These filtering operations are implemented by indexing the VizQL expressions stored with each history item. Users can also use a checkbox to limit the view to bookmarked history items.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.3">History Export and Sharing</head><p>Finally, the history viewer provides export features to share and communicate findings. By clicking the "Export" button, users can view a menu of export options. Selected history states can be output as a saved Tableau file, allowing reloading of the states as a set of worksheets. Visualization views for selected history states can also be exported as either bitmap or vector images, and can be embedded in reports and presentations. By exporting Tableau visualizations in the Windows Metafile format, we can export a set of history states directly into PowerPoint slides as editable graphics. Analysts can automatically generate a slide deck from a set of selected history states and then annotate and edit exported visualizations in PowerPoint directly, as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">USING HISTORY TO EVALUATE VISUALIZATION DESIGN</head><p>While the previous section focuses on graphical histories to support end-users, we also used histories to evaluate Tableau. By exporting and aggregating history logs, we can analyze user behavior. Here we discuss two analysis approaches and present some of our findings.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Analyzing Individual Usage with Behavior Graphs</head><p>We have explored tools for analyzing individual usage sessions. One technique we have found useful is behavior graphs, which we model after Card et al.'s web behavior graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref> shows a Tableau session visualized in a behavior graph. The graph is read in a snakelike fashion. Actions are listed left-to-right except for Undo events, which are placed right-to-left on a new row. Subsequent actions resume left-to-right ordering on a new row. Vertical columns often contain the same state, making revisitation patterns clear. Color is used to indicate the types of actions performed by users. We have found these visualizations particularly useful for understanding patterns of branching and revisitation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Analyzing Aggregate Usage</head><p>Analysis of aggregate usage is also important for determining usage patterns. For these and other history analysis tasks, we have used Tableau itself. First, we map each history log into a tabular format. Columns in these tables include timestamps, session ids, user ids, worksheet names, and actions performed. We store the resulting logs in a database which we then visualize in Tableau. Our taxonomy of commands (sec. 3.</p><p>2) enables us to analyze command usage at multiple levels of granularity. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows Tableau being used to analyze the results of collected history logs: the primary display shows a histogram of command usage, while the graphical history display contains thumbnails for other analyses. An analysis of aggregated usage timelines is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Findings</head><p>By analyzing user histories, we have made a number of findings to improve the design of Tableau's interface and estimate the impact of our history management techniques. Here we describe four such examples. All usage data has been collected using a version of Tableau that includes our augmented history model, but without a graphical history interface. Usage data has been collected from 9 Tableau employees and 27 customers willing to share their data. The data consists of 20,192 actions from 36 users, with a median of 350 actions per user. Of these, 17,401 actions result in visual history items, as non-visual actions-such as opening a workbook or adding a derived field-are not included in the history interface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">The Undo / Redo Ratio</head><p>As we designed our history interface, we wanted information about how users used the existing undo and redo features. Looking at the usage logs, we found a total of 1,023 undo events and 82 redo events: undo was ~12.5 times more common than redo. Thus, most undone actions were never revisited, a finding that supports our undo-as-delete model for managing histories (sec. 3.4.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">The Prevalence of Formatting</head><p>When analyzing command usage, we found that formatting actions, in which users adjust size and styling, accounted for 23.8% of all actions. Furthermore, they were performed in succession: 73.6% of all formatting actions were followed by an additional formatting action. In response, we crafted chunking rules (sec. 3.4.2) that coalesce all formatting events. As runs of consecutive resize events were common, subsequent development effort has also focused on improving Tableau's automatic sizing routines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3">Use of Automated Presentation Tools</head><p>Tableau's automated presentation features (named "ShowMe") <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> help users create more perceptually effective visualizations. We used history data to evaluate usage of these features by end-users. For example, we found a relatively low rate of mark type adjustment (560 mark changes among 8,248 shelf changes, for a 6.8% error rate), suggesting that the automatic selection of mark types was helpful. We also discovered that analysts used ShowMe features throughout usage sessions, suggesting that ShowMe commands had become a regular part of their visual analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.4">Estimated Impact of History Management Techniques</head><p>Finally, we have used collected history data to estimate the savings provided by our chunking rules and undo-as-delete. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the number of states culled when applying our techniques to the collected history data, showing that 61.7% of states are either removed or chunked. Thus, we might expect presented histories to be as little as 40% the size they would be without our techniques. We note, however, that this is an estimate from recorded data and as such does not include manual deletion of history items or the effects of bookmarking and annotation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper, we have introduced a design space analysis of history systems and used it to develop a prototype history interface for the Tableau visualization system. Our analysis served as a useful guide for navigating the design decisions we faced while architecting history interfaces to support visual analysis and communication. Our resulting history model integrates history management and undo/redo functionality and provides an editable, graphical history that supports branching analysis histories within worksheets and merged global   histories across worksheets. Our graphical history interface allows revisitation of previous views and is designed to complement Tableau's visual analysis features by providing overview displays of visualization states both within and across worksheets.</p><p>Our history tools introduce a suite of novel features. Our undo-asdelete feature provides an empirically-motivated mechanism for helping improve the scalability of history displays, while preserving the capability for branching histories. Our search, filter, and annotation features enable users to retrieve previous visualization views based on the data fields involved, the type of chart, and bookmarked status. Selected history items can then be exported in multiple formats, including as presentations in which Tableau visualizations can be edited as native vector graphics.</p><p>We have also applied our history model to support evaluation of the Tableau system. Our visual analysis of history logs has inspired multiple improvements to Tableau's user interface and has informed the design of our graphical history tools.</p><p>In future work, additional mechanisms for managing history may be of help. For example, our chunking rules are hand-crafted and highly specific to Tableau. Could a more general characterization of analytic tasks be applied to reuse design knowledge across visual analysis tools? Another potentially useful feature would be automated estimates of the saliency (or "importance") of visited views. Such estimates could inform semantic zooming of history displays, chunking, and more automated forms of presentation generation. How should features such as timing, revisitation, and interaction influence such a model?</p><p>Future work might further facilitate the creation of presentations from analysis histories. Our current approach enables manual selection of history views (in conjunction with search and filtering) and export of those views into external media. Other visual analysis tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> have explored explicit sharing and story-telling features. Novel tools that make use of recorded user histories for structuring presentations or story-telling may prove beneficial.</p><p>Not only might exported histories communicate findings, they may help teach analysis by example. Along these lines, analysis histories may also contribute to our understanding of common analysis patterns. Jankun-Kelly et al. developed their parameter-set model of visualization state <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> with this goal in mind. History logs have proven useful for evaluating Tableau usage. A larger-scale analysis of history patterns may better characterize sense-making processes at an operational level and suggest enhanced interface designs for supporting visual analysis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>A Graphical History Interface.
