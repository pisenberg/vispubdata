			<abstract>
				<p>Surveys and opinion polls are extremely popular in the media, especially in the months preceding a general election. However, the available tools for analyzing poll results often require specialized training. Hence, data analysis remains out of reach for many casual computer users. Moreover, the visualizations used to communicate the results of surveys are typically limited to traditional statistical graphics like bar graphs and pie charts, both of which are fundamentally noninteractive. We present a simple interactive visualization that allows users to construct queries on large tabular data sets, and view the results in real time. The results of two separate user studies suggest that our interface lowers the learning curve for naive users, while still providing enough analytical power to discover interesting correlations in the data.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Opinion polls play an important role in quantitative political and marketing research efforts. Polls provide a practical mechanism for politicians and executives to gauge public interest in their platforms and products. While poll results are always a popular news item in the media, they are of special interest this year in the United States, due to the November 2008 presidential election.</p><p>Professional polling firms regularly release reports to the public that summarize the results of their recent surveys. These reports (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>) typically consist of a written analysis, perhaps a table of numbers, and an occasional graphic like a bar graph or pie chart.</p><p>Statistical graphics like these are convenient for end-users who simply want to view a pre-canned analysis, however, they offer rather little interactivity. Moreover, depending on the editorial predisposition of the polling agency, a report may emphasize one aspect of the data more than others. If users had access to the original data along with a usable analysis tool, they would be free to expore the data on their own and discover relations among a variety of variables. Yet for most people, this kind of interactive analysis is out of reach for at least two reasons. First, the data sets used by polling agencies are often proprietary <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>. Second, current data analysis tools generally have a prohibitively steep learning curve for casual users. Our research addresses the second of these two concerns. Indeed, finding ways to simplify data analysis, bringing it to "the masses" <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>, is a subject of ongoing research in the human-computer interaction and information visualization communities.</p><p>This paper introduces a novel interactive visualization for querying and analyzing tabular demographic data. Although the visualization we propose may be applied to a variety of data types, to focus the present discussion we will restrict our examples to those relating to opinion polls. Many good visualizations exist for multivariate data <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">43]</ref>, but poll data creates a unique set of challenges. Among these considerations are:</p><p>• Analysts who work with poll data must often function under tight deadlines. On the night of an election, for example, polling organizations usually try to present their results as soon as the polls close so they can be first to predict the outcome of the election.</p><p>• Geoffrey M. <ref type="bibr">Draper</ref>  This demands that an interface allow for the rapid and facile execution of many hypothesis formulation and evaluation cycles to identify both expected and unexpected trends in the data.</p><p>• Demographic data sets focus on the many, not the few. In some application domains, the principal objective is to "drill down" into a massive data set in search of a handful of salient entities. However, in an opinion poll, the goal is to uncover meaningful trends for broad segments of society. In this context, information on individual entities is uninteresting at best, and misleading at worst. Visualizations are needed that provide uncluttered summaries of large data sets, typically from thousands to millions of entities, with comparable clarity.</p><p>• The results of opinion polls are of interest to a wide range of people, not just a handful of specialists. Hence, a visualization for opinion poll data must support not only rapid querying of the data, but also an effective presentation of the query results that requires minimal explanation even for naive users.</p><p>The requirements listed above guided the design of our visualization. Our design goals were to create an integrated query interface that supports rapid exploration and "information foraging" <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> to focus on global trends in the data. Above all, we aimed for simplicity of use. We sought a design that would be easy to learn for naive users, while still providing sufficient power for many of the tasks involved in real data analysis.</p><p>For a number of reasons, our visualization employs a radial design in which the components of the user interface are arranged in a ring shape. First, this increases the accessibility of widgets by placing them equidistant from the center of the canvas <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. Second, ring-based user interfaces are trivially delineated; an icon is either inside the ring, on the ring, or outside the ring. This reduces the number of "states" that a user has to remember.</p><p>Our interface is based on the direct manipulation metaphor, in which queries are constructed by drag and drop. Rather than navigate an external interface, queries are constructed directly within the visualization itself. The user can adjust the level of detail dynamically, viewing attributes in isolation or in comparison with others. Transitions from one query to the next are smoothly animated to preserve the user's sense of context <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">44]</ref>.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are:</p><p>• a highly interactive canvas for querying multivariate data,</p><p>• an integrated radial visualization for displaying query results,</p><p>• results from two preliminary user studies suggesting that our method is an easy-to-learn metaphor for multivariate data analysis.</p><p>We organize the remainder of this paper by, first, providing some background information on tabular data in general and opinion polls in particular. Then we review some of the relevant related research in visual query interfaces and radial visualization. We describe our visualization design in detail and present a few details about our prototype implementation. After walking through a typical usage scenario, we then discuss the results of two preliminary evaluations of the prototype by both expert and novice users. Finally, our conclusions and suggestions for future work are presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">DEFINITIONS</head><p>To facilitate the present discussion, we recall a few key terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref> from the field of database design.</p><p>• A tabular data set consists of several distinct entities.</p><p>• Each entity possesses a number of attributes.</p><p>• Each attribute, in turn, may assume any one of several values.</p><p>• The set of possible values for each attribute is called its domain.</p><p>Each entity has the same set of attributes, but the values assumed by each attribute may vary widely from entity to entity.</p><p>In an opinion poll, each entity corresponds to a person who responded to the poll. The attributes are the questions on the poll, and the domain is the set of allowable answers (values) to the poll questions. In many data sets, like an opinion poll, the values for each attribute are mutually exclusive; a respondent may select at most one answer for any given question. Moreover, while a tabular data set may consist of any number of entities, a scientifically-conducted opinion poll usually includes hundreds or thousands of respondents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RELATED WORK</head><p>This research combines aspects of two recurring themes in information visualization, namely, visual query languages and radial user interfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Database query visualization</head><p>Making databases easier to use has been a subject of research for several decades. One of the first such efforts that is still in widespread use is Query By Example <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[45]</ref>. Cammarano et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref> make the observation that most user interfaces for databases take either one of two approaches. Either the user interface aids in formulating the query, or in visualizing the results.</p><p>Sinha and Karger <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref> propose a system for aiding in navigation of semistructured data sets by suggesting navigation hints to the user. Goldman and Widom <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref> propose a method for exploiting similarities among pages in the same website to perform more effective queries. Polyviou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref> describe an interface for performing database queries based on the ubiquitous filesystem browser interface. The Vis-Trails system <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> makes use of provenance data to maintain a history of past queries for creating visualizations.</p><p>In the second category, there are many systems which offer a directmanipulation interface for browsing the results of a query. Furnas and Rauch <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref> as well as Stonebraker <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref> present canvas-based visualizations that support zooming and panning. Visage <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref> by Roth et al. is a highly interactive direct manipulation system that uses a variety of graphing techniques to communicate results to the user. ManyEyes <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[42]</ref> and Swivel [40] are websites for collaborative visualization. While not necessarily interactive, parallel coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref> and scatterplots <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[43]</ref> also support the simultaneous visualization of many variables.</p><p>In contrast, the Polaris system <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref> incorporates both a novel query interface mechanism and an integrated visualization. Based on the well-known metaphor of a pivot table in a spreadsheet, Polaris allows users to view correlations in the data with respect to any particular attribute in the data set.</p><p>Our work differs from existing systems primarily in our strict focus on ease of use and interactivity. To our knowledge, this is also the first visual query language which uses the radial layout metaphor for both querying and visualization. We review related work in radial user interfaces in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Radial user interfaces</head><p>An increasingly popular metaphor in contemporary information visualization, radial charting techniques nonetheless have a tradition spanning back hundreds of years. Pre-digital examples of radial information layouts include William Playfair's 1801 invention of the pie chart <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">36]</ref>, and Florence Nightingale's rose diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref> for communicating sanitary conditions in British military hospitals during the Crimean War. In the mid-twentieth century, Northway used radial diagrams to track the social behaviors of gradeschool children <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Much of the recent work in radial user interfaces traces its lineage to research in graph layout algorithms for computer graphics <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>. These algorithms, in turn, have inspired techniques for visualizing multivariate data. Many such designs involve positioning data points as nodes on the spokes on a wheel <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18]</ref>. In these visualizations, the center point of the canvas holds some semantic meaning, and the distance of each node from the center shows a relationship relative to it. A recent example of this is the DataRose <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref>.</p><p>In contrast, a second variety of radial visualization (called radial space filling or RSF <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref>), the data points are typically arranged in compact concentric rings <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>, and rendered so as to form a circle. Each ring represents a different attribute of the data. Examples include polar treemaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>, fan charts <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref>, and Radial Traffic Analyzer <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Another general category of radial visualization arranges the data points around the circumference of a ring, while reserving the interior of the ring for other data. Correlations among data points are often rendered as lines between nodes on the circumference and nodes in the interior. Examples include Daisy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>, NetMap <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref> and VisAlert <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>.</p><p>Our method is most closely related to the latter category. Our approach differs from previous work in that we reserve the interior of the ring for constructing user-specified queries rather than for rendering line segments between related entities. Instead, correlations in the data are displayed in a series of curved bar charts on the ring's circumference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">VISUALIZATION AND INTERACTION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">User interface</head><p>The visualization canvas occupies the main portion of the user interface ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). To the left of the canvas is a side panel containing a two-level tree structure of attributes and possible values. These can be dragged into and out of the canvas as needed. The canvas itself is a workspace upon which icons representing attributes and values can be manipulated. The most prominent feature of the canvas is the large ring in the center. We divide the canvas into three distinct regions: the ring itself, the area inside the ring, and the area outside the ring.</p><p>• Ring. The ring is divided up into multiple equiangular sectors, each representing one of the attributes in the data set. Each sector is partitioned into two concentric layers. The outer layer of the sector displays the name of the attribute. The inner layer contains a sequence of subsectors that create a (curved) stacked bar chart <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[43]</ref>. Each subsector is scaled in direct proportion to the number of entities exhibiting that attribute value, and displays the corresponding name and percentage. By default, the percentages are computed relative to the entire population, unless the population is restricted by placing values into the interior of the ring.</p><p>• Interior. By dragging specific values for an attribute into the ring's interior, the user can selectively refine the population on which the displayed percentages are based. For example, if the value Democrat from the attribute Party Affiliation is placed inside the ring, then the results displayed on the ring will reflect only those entities whose party affiliation is listed as Democratic.</p><p>• Exterior. The area outside the ring simply serves as a working storage area, or cache, for attributes and values that are not currently part of any query, but which recently were or soon may be. Attributes and values that are not likely to be needed soon can optionally be dragged to the side panel to clear up space on the canvas.</p><p>The ring itself shares some similarities to a multi-series donut chart <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>. With this visualization, however, the interior of the ring is more than a decoration; it serves as a query workspace. If desired, the user can change the size of the ring's interior and exterior radii by selecting and dragging the ring's borders.</p><p>In an effort to reduce "visual clutter" in the display, text labels are used only when it makes sense. When space permits, each subsector on the ring displays the name and percentage of the attribute value corresponding to it. When only a small fraction of the population <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. In general, values in the interior of the ring are ANDed together to form the query string. Multiple values from the same attribute, on the other hand, are ORed instead. In the visualization, this is indicated by rendering a thin labeled edge between the appropriate icons. manifests a particular value for a given attribute, the corresponding subsector may be too small to accommodate displaying both the name and percentage labels. In that case, only the name is presented. If the subsector is too small even for that, then no text is rendered in that subsector. In any event, "mousing over" any component of the canvas shows a tooltip revealing details about the underlying attribute. Alternatively, the canvas can be zoomed and panned to show more detail. Thus, textual information about small areas of the visualization is available on demand, but does not otherwise crowd the display.</p><p>Within the exterior visualization area, attributes are represented as drop-down combo boxes. When expanded, an attribute box reveals a menu of possible values, which the user can then select and drag inside or outside the ring.</p><p>For each value inside the ring, the sample population is refined by ANDing the values together. For example, if the values Democrat, Women, and Married (from the attributes Party Affiliation, Gender, and Marital Status, respectively) were placed in the ring's interior, then the percentages displayed on the ring would reflect the subset of the total population that fits the description of married women who are Democrats <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2</ref>). There is no theoretical limit to the number of values that can be placed within the ring's interior. However, in practice, adding too many constraints may limit the sample population to so few entities that the results are no longer statistically significant. Accordingly, our prototype system displays the size of the current query population in the lower left corner of the visualization canvas.</p><p>The user can also drag multiple values for the same attribute into the interior of the ring. However, as noted in Section 2, the possible values for each attribute are mutually exclusive. For example, a person's party affiliation may be either Democratic or Republican, but not both simultaneously. Hence, performing a query to find all entities that are both Democratic AND Republican would yield a population of zero. Therefore, queries involving multiple values from the same attribute use an implied OR operator instead of AND. In the visualization, this is shown by rendering a thin line between the icons as a visual reminder that they belong to the same attribute <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref>.</p><p>Each time a value is dragged into or out of the ring's interior, the sectors on the ring are updated to reflect the values for the population specified in the current query. The transition from the previous to the current query's results is smoothly animated to help the user maintain a sense of context <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[44]</ref>. The queries take place in real time, enabling interactive data exploration and rapid testing of hypotheses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Multifaceted data exploration</head><p>If taken in isolation, the method described above would make this interface merely a nice widget for analyzing the demographics of people who vote in certain ways. However, our technique goes one step further. The user can see percentage information about any attribute in the data set, not just those related to respondents' opinions. Consistent with the other aspects of our user interface, this is done by direct manipulation. The user can drag any attribute from the tree in the side panel, or from the area outside the ring, and drop it onto the ring itself <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 4)</ref>. The visualization immediately updates to show the breakdown of the survey population with respect to that attribute. Likewise, any attribute on the ring's circumference may be dragged to the exterior, therefore excluding it from consideration. This ability to view the data from the perspective of any attribute permits the user to find relationships or spot trends that the compilers of the data may not have envisioned. In some ways, this behavior is reminiscent of a pivot table in a spreadsheet <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>, albeit with an arguably simpler interface.</p><p>In effect, what we have described is a direct manipulation interface for specifying two complementary kinds of queries.</p><p>1. By dragging an attribute value into (or out of) the ring's interior, the user restricts the query to a subset of the total population that matches certain characteristics.</p><p>2. By dragging an attribute onto (or off of) the ring's circumference, the user specifies the attributes for which quantitative information is desired, regarding the given population.</p><p>Stated another way, the values inside the ring could be considered independent variables in that they determine the results of the dependent variables on the ring's circumference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">SQL and geometry generation</head><p>Each time the user adds or removes an entity from the ring, the system issues a batch of SQL queries to the underlying database. The results of these queries determine the size of the sectors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">SQL generation</head><p>The SQL statements are of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">SELECT COUNT( * ) FROM T WHERE Q1 AND Q2</formula><p>where T is the name of the database Q2 is determined by the attribute/value pairs on the ring itself. Whereas Q1 is constant for each query in a given batch, Q2 is unique for each attribute/value pair. For example, if the attribute Party Affiliation were on the circumference, Q2 would assume a different value for each possible value of that attribute:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Q2 1 := partyAffiliation=republican Q2 2 := partyAffiliation=independent Q2 3 := partyAffiliation=democrat</formula><p>Thus, the full SQL syntax for a typical query, using a table name of "voters" and the values for Q1 and Q2 1 as outlined above, is expressed as:</p><p>SELECT COUNT( * ) FROM voters WHERE maritalStatus=married AND (employment=student OR employment=retired ) AND partyAffiliation=republican</p><p>Similar queries are issued for each attribute/value pair. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Geometry</head><p>Each sector of the ring corresponds to a single attribute in the data set, and is allocated an equal proportion of the ring's circumference. Thus, if A is the number of attributes currently on the ring, then each attribute is allocated 2π A radians. As noted previously, the inner layer of each sector is a stacked bar chart showing the percentage of the survey population which matches both that value for the attribute and those inside the ring. We now describe the algorithm for tabulating these queries and sizing each subsector of the stacked bar chart. First, let: S = {all values currently inside the ring} <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> We define a function E(S) that yields the number of entities in the population whose attributes match the values in S.</p><p>The domain of each attribute is variable-sized, dependent on the schema of the data set. Let V (a i ) be the number of values in attribute a i 's domain. Thus, whenever a value is added to or removed from either the ring or its interior, the system issues N separate queries to the underlying database, one query for each value of each attribute currently on the ring. N is computed thus:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">N = A ∑ i=1 V (a i )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Furthermore, each subsector of an attribute's stacked bar chart is functionally identified by the attribute and value corresponding to it. We write this as a pair (a i , v n ) where a i is an attribute and v n is a value within that attribute. Hence, each of the N queries is uniquely identified by the pair <ref type="figure">(S, (a i , v n )</ref>).</p><p>Let Q be a function that returns the number of entities in the data set that match the tuple <ref type="figure">(S, (a i , v n )</ref>). This number is then divided by E(S), to give a fractional value P(S, (a i , v n )) between 0 and 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P(S, (a i , v n )) = Q(S, (a i , v n )) E(S)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Let θ v n represent the radians allocated to a value v n within attribute a i 's stacked bar chart.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">θ v n = 2π A P(S, (a i , v n ))<label>(4)</label></formula><p>This computation takes place for each of the N queries, each time the user drags a value onto, inside, or outside the ring. The geometry for each bar chart is reconstructed based on the radial values calculated above. The animated transitions between queries are implemented in a straightforward manner, by linearly interpolating the radial magnitude of each sector for each key frame <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>The SQL generation, query execution, and geometric computations take place automatically, behind the scenes. All the user sees is that the sectors "magically" resize according to the terms he or she dictates by dragging icons around the canvas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Observations on scalability</head><p>Our visual design was inspired by the growing popularity of radial user interfaces in information visualization and visual analytics. Our visualization differs from previous radial layouts in at least two respects, both of which increase the scalability of our technique.</p><p>First, it is a common practice in some radial visualizations to render a separate icon on the ring's circumference for each individual entity in the data set (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>). The work by Livnat et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref> does alleviate the problem somewhat by allowing similar nodes to be clustered together, but does not fundamentally alter the "one icon per entity" paradigm. This approach does not scale to very large data sets; ultimately the icons for individual entities become too small to be useful. A key difference in our work is that we put attributes, not entities, on the ring's circumference. This approach is particularly well-suited to opinion polls, which typically have no more than a few dozen questions (attributes), but can and do have thousands The canvas's resolution could have been increased to give the sectors more room to grow, but in this case, we intentionally limited the area to show that the visualization is still useful even when many attributes are examined simultaneously. By design, the icons on the ring depict a relatively small number of attributes, while the number of entities in the data set can grow arbitrarily large.</p><p>of individual respondents (entities). In fact, a larger data set simply results in a richer experience for the user, because the data is representative of a larger population and therefore less subject to skew occasioned by inconsistencies in the data. We have tested our system with a data set of one million entities with only minimal slowdown (2 to 3 seconds on a standard PC) in system responsiveness.</p><p>Although this approach is not appropriate for data sets with hundreds or thousands of attribute types, opinion polls rarely exhibit this. Even if the user chooses to put every attribute on the ring <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 5</ref>), this does not significantly compromise the utility of the visualization, as the most frequently occuring values for each attribute still occupy a dominant proportion of its sector.</p><p>Second, previous radial visualizations often render lines between nodes on the circumference of the ring to convey relationships within the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24]</ref>. While this can be an effective technique for visual correlation when employed in limited quantities, as the number of lines increases, the visualization becomes virtually a "cloud" of intersecting lines, making it difficult for the user to gain insight regarding specific nodes. Holten <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref> addresses this issue by bundling related edges together, but this too has its limitations. In contrast, our visualization renders lines between icons only in limited situations (see Section 4.1). Instead, there is an implied "many to many" correlation between the terms of the query shown in the ring's interior and the results of the query shown on the ring itself. Thus, associations within the data are implicit, and avoid a lot of crisscrossing lines which obscure the display.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">IMPLEMENTATION NOTES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Software prototype</head><p>As a practical demonstration of the concepts outlined in this paper, we have implemented a software prototype of the visualization. We call our prototype SQiRL, an acronym for Simple Query Interface with a Radial Layout. The client software is implemented in Java 1.6, with a MySQL database backend. The default color scheme for the ring's sectors was chosen somewhat arbitrarily, but it can be customized via a "Preferences" dialog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Data set</head><p>The data set used in our examples and screenshots is from an exit poll taken during the November 2007 mayoral election in Salt Lake City, Utah. While any number of survey data sets would have sufficed, we chose this one because its content was relevant to our base of volunteer testers, who reside primarily in the greater Salt Lake City area.</p><p>The survey was conducted by the Utah Colleges Exit Poll, a nonpartisan university-sponsored research program. The data set consists of 3,484 unique responses to the survey. The data set was given to us in SPSS format <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>, but we converted it to a relational database for the purposes of our implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">WALKTHROUGH</head><p>We describe a scenario of how the visualization could typically be used. The data set in this example is the November 2007 election data set described in Section 5.2. For a more detailed usage scenario, the reader is referred to the supplementary video on the conference DVD.</p><p>When the user is first presented with the visualization canvas, there are no values in the ring's interior. Thus, the results shown on the ring reflect the total population surveyed. By default, the ring shows the results for the three issues on the ballot.</p><p>Next, the user might pose the question, "Do people who run their own business tend to vote in a certain way?" To answer this question, the user restricts the sample population to entrepreneurs only. She does this by expanding the attribute labeled Current Employment in the side panel, and dragging the value labeled "Self-employed" into the ring's interior <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 6</ref>). (Alternatively, she could have dragged the entire Current Employment attribute onto the canvas, and then selected and dragged the desired value from the resultant combo box into the ring's interior. These two approaches are functionally equivalent.)</p><p>As soon as the user drops the icon inside the ring, the system initiates a new batch of queries on the underlying data. The ring's sectors immediately begin to rescale via a smooth animation. When the animation completes, the stacked bar charts on the ring reflect the attributes of those survey respondents who identified themselves as "self employed."</p><p>Next, the user wants to further refine the query to "all voters who are self employed and who use the Internet more than once a day." This is done by dragging the value labeled More than once a day from the attribute Internet Usage into the ring's interior. As before, the percentages on the ring are updated to reflect the new query terms.</p><p>The user now wishes to see how well-educated the surveyed population is. Recall that any attribute in the data set can be placed on the ring. Thus, she drags the attribute Education Level from the side panel onto the ring. The attributes already on the ring gradually decrease in size to accommodate the newcomer, and the percentages for each value on the new attribute are shown.</p><p>With this gesture, the user has begun analyzing general characteristics of the survey population, unrelated to election results. She next removes all ballot-related issues from the ring and replaces them with other attributes of purely demographic interest, such as Annual Income or Religious Preference. The user can now perform queries on the population not necessarily related to voter behavior. This a strength of our technique: each attribute of the data is manipulated in a completely analogous manner.</p><p>By examining the data from the perspective of any paticular attribute, users can uncover trends that the compilers of the data set may not have envisioned. (Do people who live on one side of town tend to have higher incomes? Are married or single people more likely to earn advanced degrees?) This information is readily available in the data set, but is unlikely to show up in a report written to communicate a specific type of information, such as voter preferences, to a general audience. Such insights are only available when users are granted access to the original data set and a tool that makes arbitrary queries simple and fast.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">EVALUATION 7.1 User studies</head><p>To gain understanding and experience towards validating our technique, we conducted two preliminary user studies. The first involved two expert users, and the second involved 52 casual users. The purpose of these initial studies was to verify that this technique is easy to learn for both expert and novice users, not to perform a quantitative comparison against existing methods. Nevertheless, motivated by the positive feedback from these preliminary studies, we are in the process of preparing a formal comparative user trial in which we will compare users' performances with this tool versus existing visualization techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.1">Expert review</head><p>We conducted a qualitative expert review of our prototype implementation involving two political science professors from a neighboring university. Neither of the two had prior knowledge of our system, although both were expert users of commercial data analysis software. The evaluation consisted of an informal 30-minute demonstration and discussion. After less than 5 minutes of instruction on the interface, they felt comfortable using it to construct their own queries. One of the participants described the interface as "engaging," explaining how its interactivity engenders exploration. On the other hand, our expert reviewers were split on the radial style of the visualization. One thought it might be confusing to novices, while the other appreciated how it kept all the information in one place.</p><p>Overall, their response to the prototype was enthusiastic. One participant suggested that the interface could augment the election result visualization used by <ref type="bibr">CNN [2]</ref>. They also recommended our visualization for use as a teaching aid in political science classes. Both participants appreciated the use of animation to create a smooth transition from one query result to the next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.2">Novice review</head><p>For our second user trial, we recruited 52 participants (20 women, 32 men) from the Salt Lake City area. Their ages ranged from 17 to 55, with a median age of 26. Of the 52 participants, relatively few <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(7)</ref> were computer science students. The test was run on a standard PC with a 1400x1050 resolution display. Each participant completed the user study individually, without collaboration with others.</p><p>The structure of this study was as follows. First, each participant watched a 3-minute video which gave a brief demonstration of the software. Each participant was then allotted 2 minutes of "free play" time in which he or she could practice using the interface. Next, we gave each participant a sequence of 9 analysis tasks, based on the November 2007 election data set. The first 3 tasks were straightforward queries regarding the results of the election. The final 6 tasks were more general, nudging the user to uncover broad demographic characteristics of the survey population. At the conclusion of the 9 tasks, each participant was invited to submit written comments. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> shows the tasks together with the average completion times and success rates. A large majority of our participants (88%) said that they enjoyed using the interface. Slightly over two thirds (71%) completed all 9 analysis tasks with no errors, however there was a wide variation in the amount of time it took participants to complete the tasks. Of those who finished the tasks successfully, the fastest took 2 minutes and 43 seconds, and the slowest took 12 minutes and 47 seconds. So while most participants reportedly found the visualization fun and useful, clearly some "got it" faster than others.</p><p>The most revealing observation was that some users were confused about the difference between the gesture required for specifying the characteristics of the sample population versus the gesture for exposing numerical information about that population. Consider, for example, task #9: "Of those voters whose location is west of State Street, what percentage claim a party affiliation of Democrat?" The required gesture was to drag the icon labeled "West of State Street" into the ring's interior (thus limiting the sample population to only those who live west of State Street), and then drag the attribute "Party Affiliation" to the ring's circumference (thus revealing the relative representation of each political party in the sample population). Some participants first tried the opposite approach, placing the "Democrat" icon in the ring's interior, and the "Location" attribute on the ring. This is a perfectly valid query, but it poses a different question, namely, "What percentage of all Democrats live west of State Street?" This will be something to watch for in future user studies and in subsequent evolutions of the visualization design.</p><p>Informal qualitative feedback was predominantly positive. For example, many participants voluntarily lingered after they had completed the tasks, in order to explore the data set on their own. One participant wrote, "I'm not good with new programs, but it was easy to catch on." Another participant commented, in comparison with current data analysis tools, "This ... is way easier to use than a spreadsheet or pivot table." Especially encouraging were comments such as, "I watch a lot of political news programs and I have never seen any polling data that was so comprehensive," and "I need this for my work!" Negative feedback related mainly to confusion over whether to put icons inside the ring or on the ring, as previously noted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Suitability for purpose</head><p>Our interactive technique and visualization provide a fast and effective way to analyze opinion poll data. As with any technique, it is important to use the right tool for the right job. Our query metaphor may not be appropriate for every analysis problem, but it is well suited for the kinds of analysis performed regularly by polling agencies in their public reports, and similar applications.</p><p>To justify this statement, we have read a number of press releases and whitepapers from a variety of public opinion organizations. To focus the present discussion, however, we mention three typical reports: a press release prepared by the Utah Colleges Exit Poll regarding the November 2007 Salt Lake City election <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[41]</ref>, a June 2008 report from Gallup, Inc. regarding the demographics of likely voters in the U.S. presidential election <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>, and a June 2008 report from Rasmussen Reports, Inc. regarding public perceptions of U.S. presidential candidates <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Each of these reports makes several statistical assertions similar to "X percent of all voters in group Y voted for candidate Z." Given the proper data sets, our visualization could easily confirm the results reported in these reports, as well as spot other trends not necessarily reported. We found no statements in the vast majority of press releases we examined that could not be readily performed with our system.</p><p>Thus, we do not suggest that our technique does anything that cannot be done with existing tools; rather, it makes certain classes of frequently recurring queries both easy and fast to perform, with minimal training -a conclusion supported by our preliminary user studies. Further testing is necessary to establish statistically significant conclusions with respect to competing visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>This paper presents a visual query language for analyzing poll-based surveys. The method consists of a direct manipulation interface in which icons representing entire attributes and individual values can be introduced into and withdrawn from queries in a straightforward manner. The highly interactive visualization allows users to experiment with the data and test multiple hypotheses in rapid succession. Because our technique uses attributes, not distinct entities, as the basic unit of visualization, it can be used to view very large data sets. We have tested the prototype with data sets containing up to one million entities while still maintaining interactive speeds. Preliminary user trials suggest that the interface is simple enough for both novice and expert users to learn quickly. We are currently planning additional quantitative user studies to compare user performance using our technique versus existing tools.</p><p>In the process of creating the visualization metaphor described in this paper, we faced a number of design and interface challenges. We overcame many of these, but there are still a number of remaining issues. First, we have not yet designed an elegant way to visualize the special case of when the attribute for a value inside the ring also appears on the circumference. We currently handle this by making all the subsectors equiangular for that attribute, but this may not be intuitive. Second, and more importantly, a clean interface for comparing the results of two queries is needed. We have explored a variety of design options, but are still searching for one that balances the competing virtues of conserving screen real estate and maintaining a noncluttered display. Additional user testing will be required to determine which of our several hypotheses will be most meaningful to users.</p><p>Although initially created for the purpose of analyzing opinion poll data, we believe that this visualization metaphor might be generalizable to many kinds of tabular data where the set of attributes is not excessively large. For example, the visualization could be used in a healthcare setting to analyze demographic characteristics of individuals who have contracted a particular disease. In the domain of homeland security and law enforcement, the visualization could be used to discover commonalities among known terrorists or other criminals.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Startup screenshot of our prototype system.
