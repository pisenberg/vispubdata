			<abstract>
				<p>This paper proposes novel methods for visualizing specifically the large power-law graphs that arise in sociology and the sciences. In such cases a large portion of edges can be shown to be less important and removed while preserving component connectedness and other features (e.g. cliques) to more clearly reveal the network&apos;s underlying connection pathways. This simplification approach deterministically filters (instead of clustering) the graph to retain important node and edge semantics, and works both automatically and interactively. The improved graph filtering and layout is combined with a novel computer graphics anisotropic shading of the dense crisscrossing array of edges to yield a full social network and scale-free graph visualization system. Both quantitative analysis and visual results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Social and other scale-free networks are graphs with few nodes of higher degrees and many of lower degrees, such that the number of nodes of degree k follows a power-law distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This distribution is ubiquitous, natural and commonly found in the relationships studied in sociology, networking, biology and physics.</p><p>These graphs are rarely planar, and even the best layout methods yield a space-filling jumble of edge crossings for even medium-scale graphs. For example, <ref type="figure">Fig. 1(a)</ref> displays the scale-free network of 1,948 interactions between 1,458 yeast proteins.</p><p>Such large graphs can be more effectively visualized in a simplified form so long as the simplification preserves the important structures and features of the original. Sec. 2 reviews a variety of graph simplification methods.</p><p>Node clustering simplifies graphs by merging neighboring nodes, which when repeated organizes the graph into a hierarchy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Clustering works well on planar graphs. When applied to non-planar graphs, it can actually increase edge density which makes the layout less flexible and the display more jumbled with more edge crossings. For example, the geodesic clustering used for the visualization in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1(c)</ref> increases the edge density from 1.34 to 1.46 edges/node and the effect worsens with the increased clustering of larger graphs. Furthermore, the merged nodes and edges created by node clustering lose their original semantics.</p><p>Filtering methods retain edge and node semantics by ensuring the simplified graph is a subgraph of the original. Stochastic filtering approaches statistically sample the graph, scaling well and preserving the expectation of various graph characteristics. But for the visualization of scale-free networks where most nodes are of least degree, stochastic filtering can destroy connectivity and other features, as it did in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(b).</head><p>Deterministic filtering methods remove edges based on a metric defined on graph elements. One commonly used metric is "betweenness centrality," <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> which indicates how often a node lies on the shortest <ref type="bibr">(</ref> nodes</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">BC(v) = ∑ u =v =w∈V σ u,w (v)/σ u,w<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where σ u,w counts the number of shortest paths between u and w, and σ u,w (v) counts only the ones containing v.</p><p>Girvan and Newman <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> compute the betweeness centrality for edges instead of nodes, and remove the highest BC edges from a graph to isolate and cluster its subnetworks. But scale-free networks do not cluster well because most of their nodes are minimally connected, so for their visualization we instead remove the lowest BC edges from a graph, leaving a skeletal substructure of communication pathways. Our filtered simplification in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1(d)</ref> removes 50% of the edges while retaining 80% of its total betweenness centrality, as a measure of its preservation of communication pathways.</p><p>This development leads to a novel deterministic filtering approach that improves the simplification, layout and visualization of scale-free networks. This method filters a graph by removing edges in order of increasing betweenness centrality. We constrain this filter to preserve connectivity and other features (e.g. cliques) by marking feature edges in a graph preprocessing pass, and keeping an edge if it is marked or if its removal disconnects a connected component of the original graph. The resulting simplified graph thus avoids the distraction of edges seldom utilitized in the propagation of information across the network, while retaining the connectivity and other pre-identified features of the original. Furthermore, removing edges improves the flexibility, convergence and quality of node layout algorithms. <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> illustrates this approach as detailed in Sec. 3.</p><p>The betweenness centrality edge metric relies on an expensive allpairs shortest path computation. We discovered that on scale-free networks, betweenness centrality can be accurately approximated by computing shortest paths only from hubs, of which there are only O(log n) according to the power-law distribution, as described in Sec. 4, which also compares other approximations to establish the novelty of our hub-subset BC. We believe this approach is novel, as a recent survey of BC variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> includes choosing a random subset of shortest path endpoints but not specifically targeting the hubs.</p><p>Because edge-filtered graphs can still be large and visually complex, our visualization method also incorporates rendering techniques suited to dense fibrous materials to aid in understanding. The anisotropic shading of thin threadlike materials is a familiar cue of fibrous directionality. Shading a scale-free network's dense mass of edges in this manner accentuates hubs which appear like the poles of wound-thread holiday ornaments, as shown in Sec. 5.</p><p>The results in Sec. 6 demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach at simplifying and displaying scale-free networks, followed by conclusions in Section 7.  <ref type="figure">1</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PREVIOUS WORK</head><p>Recent previous work relevant to the simplification and visualization of power-law graphs is briefly summarized below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Graph Layout</head><p>Force-directed approaches are easy to implement and work well for most graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Recent, more powerful layout methods have been proposed, including GEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, GRIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, ACE <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, FM3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and Topolayout <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, but work better on near planar graphs. None of these work well for large power-law graph visualization because of the dense edges crossings they produce, which prompted our investigation into (edge) simplification. Our contribution makes these algorithms practical for scale-free graphs by providing a simpler domain for layout. In implementation, our results are laid out using either force-directed FR method <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> or GEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Node Clustering</head><p>Brandes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> survey a variety of clustering approaches. Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> hierarchically clustered nodes by their shortest-path distance from hub nodes (chosen by min BC or max degree) for data mining and visualizing power-law graphs. Kumar and Garland <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> used clustering to stratify a graph into different layers for independent, faster layout and overlayed for interactive visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Stochastic Filtering</head><p>Rafiei and Curial <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> used stochastic and focus-based filtering schemes to simplify large graphs for visualization. Leskovec and Faloutsos <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> analyzed these for a variety of graph properties using random node/edge selection and random walks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Deterministic Filtering</head><p>As mentioned in the introduction, Girvan and Newman <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> removed high-BC edges to isolate hubs to facilitate their clustering. Auber et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> filtered out weak edges in a weighted graph to display a clustered hierarchy of strongly connected graph components. Both Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and Boutin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> filter graphs by growing a tree of nodes and edges from a user selected root node, the latter yielding a spanning tree whose degree-based construction retained the scalefree statistics of the original graph, and adding back "short edges" to preserve small clusters. Such tree-growing filters resemble graph spanners <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> which yield a metric-approximate subgraph, whereas our approach removes low-BC edges to yield a communicationsapproximate subgraph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">EDGE FILTERING</head><p>Given a graph G = {V, E}, we find a simplified subgraph G = {V, E ⊆ E} such that nodes connected by a pathway in G remain connected by some pathway in G . We also identify and mark feature edges, (specifically those that form cliques) in G so they can be preserved in G . We compute and assign an edge metric bc(e) (approximating betweenness centrality). We remove only unmarked edges in order of non-decreasing bc(e), and only those edges whose removal does not increase the number of connected components. <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> illustrates the implementation of this process. The initial connectivity test determines the number of connected components in the initial graph. An input graph with multiple components is handled by processing each of its connected component individually. For the sake of discussion, we assume G contains a single connected component.</p><p>We then compute and assign the edge metric. We use a faster approximation of betweenness centrality described in Sec. 4. We also optionally detect graph features and mark relevant edges to prevent them from being filtered. Feature detection can happen concurrently with edge metric assignment unless the feature is based on the metric. In Sec. 3.1 we describe a simple clique detection.</p><p>For edge filtering, we store all unmarked edges in a priority queue sorted by non-decreasing metric. With each node, we also store its degree. Before we remove an edge, we check the degree of its two nodes. Only if both degrees exceed two do we remove the edge and decrement them. This degree test helps but does not guarantee that the graph remain connected. To preserve graph connectivity we perform a post-processing pass described in Sec. 3.2.</p><p>We continue to remove edges in priority queue order until we reach a user-specified number of edges or a desired edge-metric threshold. The result is a simplified subgraph. We run a layout algorithm on the simplified graph G , which generally produces better results than it would on the original G.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Feature Detection</head><p>The edge filtering system supports feature preservation by marking edges and preventing their removal. Such features can be local or x 10  <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. (Left) Plot of the relative error of our BC approximation on the graph "bo." Errors tend to occur closer to cluster centers, and fall within a factor of two of actual BC in almost all edges. (Center) Summed squared error between the geodesic distance matrix of the original graph and that of the graph simplified by random sampling, geodesic clustering and our method, for the graph "bo." (Right) Root-mean-square error of node betweenness centrality when comparing that of the original graph to that of graphs simplified by random sampling and our method, for the graph "bo."</p><p>global graph features or user-defined external features. We demonstrate this ability by detecting and preserving cliques, which are maximally connected subgraphs that often represent nodes equally and closely related. For example, stocks that form a clique in a correlation financial network indicate different companies in the same financial sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Detecting maximum cliques in graphs is an NP-Complete problem. We implemented a fast heuristic, described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, to find highly-connected components in graphs. It was originally used to find clusters in software systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and applied to visualize small world networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, but only recently shown to detect graph cliques <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> in time O(m deg(G)) where deg(G) is the maximum node degree of the graph G. Since G is connected, its degree is at least two, and at most n − 1. Given their degree distribution, clique detection in scale-free networks is thus likely O(mn).</p><p>Clique detection and preservation is demonstrated by the five highly connected subgraphs of the financial graph visualized in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7(right)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Connectivity Post Processing</head><p>An inefficient method to preserve graph connectivity during edge filtering would be to check whether an edge removal separated the graph into two components, but this approach would take O(n(m−m )) time, where m − m represents the number of edges removed during edge filtering.</p><p>Instead, we use a post processing procedure to recover graph connectivity after edge filtering is finished. We maintain an ordered list recording all of the edge removals. (The list order should coincide with its edge's metric order). If G contains more than one component, then we label each node in G according to its connected component. We then iterate through the removed edges in reverse order of removal. If an edge links a pair of nodes belonging to different components of G , then we restore that edge to G and relabel the nodes in the two newly joined components to indicate it is now a single component. The iteration continues until G contains a single component, and takes O(n + m − m ) time.</p><p>The preservation of connectivity, when combined with the betweenness centrality metric, tends to retain shortest paths which depict likely communication pathways for visualization and also aid shortest distance queries for data mining applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY APPROXIMATION</head><p>Though many edge metrics currently exist, we focus specifically on metrics based on shortest paths to accentuate the communication pathways in a scale-free network. The shortest path, a.k.a. geodesic path, is a conventional choice for measuring the relative importance of edges <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Our edge metric is a fast approximation of betweenness centrality which counts the number of shortest paths through an edge.</p><p>Computing the shortest paths from all nodes to measure edge BC can be very expensive for large graphs. The all pairs shortest path (APSP) can be computed in time O(nm + n 2 ) by computing BFS from every node <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. One can also compute APSP in O(n 3 ) time via the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Brandes's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> for computing node BC runs similarly in O(nm) time for unweighted graphs and O(nm + n 2 log n) time for weighted graphs.</p><p>Betweenness centrality can be estimated more efficiently. By looking at a subset of vertices proportional to log n/ε 2 , BC can be estimated to at worst εn(n − 1) with probability 1/n in O((m + n)(log n)/ε 2 ) on an unweighted graph or O((m + n log n)(log n)/ε 2 ) on a weighted graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Lloyd's algorithm can also be used to distribute random "pivots" from which to compute BC <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Adaptive sampling improves the estimate, where the number of samples needed is affected by the results of the samples. The betweenness centrality of a vertex can be estimated as n 2 /t for some t ≥ 1, within a factor of 1/ε, for ε &lt; 1/2, by running single source shortest path (SSSP) from only ε × t nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>For scale-free networks, we find that the betweenness centrality of an edge can be approximated sufficiently well by counting the number of shortest paths between only the highest degree hub nodes. Restricting the shortest-path end nodes reduces the absolute BC but since we use it as a metric for edge filtering, it only needs to construct a relative edge ordering.</p><p>Since the node degree distribution is logarithmic, we select only c log(n) of the highest degree hub nodes, where c = 10 in our implementation. This BC approximation thus runs in time O((m + n) log n) for unweighted graphs, and O((m + n) log 2 n) for weighted graphs. An example of the fidelity of this approximation is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3 (left)</ref>. For small graphs, we will select at least 50 hub nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">RENDERING</head><p>The conventional depiction of a graph via constant color line rasterization does not work well for large graphs, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>, as the number of edges can overwhelm display resolution, visual acuity and perceptual processing. We have thus adapted several approaches from photorealistic computer graphics to help with the visual depiction of large power-law graphs.</p><p>We use alpha blending to rasterize very thin lines. For conventional two-dimensional layouts, we display edges in order of increasing edge metric, such that more important edges occlude less important ones.</p><p>We use color to highlight the degree distribution of power-law graphs, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>, to accentuate hubs among a mass of crisscrossing edges. We use a cold-to-warm color map indexed by node degree, which perceptually brings warm-colored high-degree hubs to  the foreground and allows the remaining cool-colored low-degree elements to be slightly less distracting in the background. Since we display edges instead of nodes, we interpolate node colors along each edge.</p><p>Since node degree is distributed according to a power-law, mapping colors linearly to degree does not adequately differentiate node degree. We instead borrow a tone-mapping technique, originally developed for converting physical power to perceptual brightness <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, to get the map</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">t(v) = deg(v) 1 + deg(v)d/ deg(G ) 2 d + deg(v)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where t(v) is the logarithmic color index used to color node v, deg(G ) is the maximum degree in the (simplified) displayed graph G , and d is a user parameter indicating the degree that should map to t = 1/2 with the assumption deg(G ) d.</p><p>For dense graphs such as scale-free networks, anisotropic shading conveys directionality and allows the user to distinguish individual edges. We have applied a technique originally developed for shading fibrous materials such as fur to the similarly dense lines present in power law graph visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5</ref> demonstrates how anisotropic shading conveys form and directionality by highlighting edges based on their orientation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we verify our method with error analyses and visual results. These results are based on 2-D layouts computed by either the GEM layout method or 100 iterations of the FR force-directed layout method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Error Analysis</head><p>To verify our sampling method quantitatively, we measured the errors of various graph metrics introduced by various simplification approaches, namely random edge sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref> and geodesic clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. We averaged the errors generated by random edge sampling over three separate executions. We also compared our edge filtering performance using the exact edge BC computed on the original graph and our approximation of edge BC computed using shortest paths only between the highest-degree hubs. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3 (center)</ref> indicates how simplification distorts the shortest paths of a graph. For each graph including the original, we compute an  n 2 distance matrix containing the length of the shortest path between the row's node and the column's node. This distance matrix is used for graph mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and is sensitive to changes in the graph. We then measure the sum of the squared differences of these distance matrix elements from those of the original's, for graphs whose edges are filtered from the original m edges to the minimum n − 1 spanning-tree edges needed to maintain a connected subgraph. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3 (right)</ref> indicates how removing edges in order of the original graph's edge betweenness centrality affects the betweenness centrality of the nodes in the simplified graph. Node BC is less sensitive than the distance matrix to changes in the graph. Note that our filtering order relies on the edge BC of the original graph and the filtering method does not recompute the BC ordering when each edge is removed. In this RMS error graph, we compare the recomputed node BC against the original node BC to determine the node BC error introduced by simplification. Because BC is not defined for cluster hierarchies, we did not compare geodesic clustering.</p><p>Both comparisons show our method generates fewer errors than previous methods for a reasonable number of edges in the simplified graph, which is at least 1500 for graph "bo". Moreover, the approximate BC metric filtering performs about as well as exact BC metric filtering, which further justifies the approximation.</p><p>As the number of remaining edges approaches the number of nodes, the error of our approach increases dramatically, likely because low BC edges are preserved to maintain connectivity, causing even higher BC edges to be removed instead.</p><p>Fewer edges means easier visualization, so we provide a slider that allows the user to interactively specify the portion of edges to retain to best compromise visual clarity with graph accuracy. We found empirically that this compromise worked best when retaining 3% more edges than nodes (plus any feature preserved edges).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Visual results</head><p>We have applied our method to simplify and visualize several graphs from different areas whose nodes and edges range from hundreds to millions. <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> compares our method to geodesic clustering [32] on the graph "bo." In both cases, nodes "224" and "1183" are important. Both results find similar neighboring nodes for "224." The main differences    between the methods are that our method retains all of the original nodes and its simplified edges also appear in the original, such that the elements of the simplification retain the original's semantics. The edge between nodes "108" and "224" in the geodesic clustering implies these two proteins interact, but they do not in the original dataset. However, they do not in the original data. Second, our method provides a clear overview of all nodes in the graph while their method only shows a subset. <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref> compares our method to graph stratification <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> on the graph "sp500-38," which represents 3,206 cross correlations of price fluctuation of 365 stocks from the S&amp;P 500. Both extract similar information from the original graph. Our result detects and preserves five cliques, and retains the difference between "GS" and "MER" which share few connections yet get clustered in the graph stratification visualization. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> visualizes the 773 co-authorship relations among the SIG-GRAPH 2007 papers' 328 authors. This graph is small and contains a pair of main components, one of which is examined in more detail. Even for a graph of this smaller size, the edge overlaps produced by the graph's non-planarity make it difficult to visualize, whereas out edge filtering makes the graph planar, allows its layout to be more evenly distributed, but retains a clear depiction of the original's hubs. <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref> visualizes the graph "cg-web," representing 8,131 links between 2,269 computational geometry websites. This very dense collection becomes slightly easier to visualize when our edge filtering reduces it to 2,381 edges, better revealing its hubs and yielding a more even radial structure. <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref> visualizes the graph "hep-th," representing 27,400 citations among 352,021 high-energy theoretical physics preprints on arXiv. The mass of nodes and edges makes visualization impractical, but edge filtering organizes this detail into a connected constellation of clumps to more clearly identify the seminal publications and areas of research within this field. <ref type="figure">Fig. 11</ref> shows the results on the directed graph data "asrel.20071008", which is obtained from the CAIDA's ranking of Autonomous Systems. Each of the 26,242 nodes represents the collection of IP networks and routers under the control of a single entity, and each of the 53,174 directed edges represents a service. Our filtering and display ignores edge direction, but edge filtering better organizes the global and local hubs from their default clump into a more spatious configuration. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 4 and 5</ref> show the results on the graph data "flickr", which represents 6,625,280 friendships of 820,878 users on the photo sharing website flickr.com. For such massive graphs containing more edges than pixels, the anisotropic shading techniques better indicate the hubs in the edge filtered version, and also variation among the otherwise unform edge directions emanating from the center. The grey square in right upper corner of the middle image is an interactive widget controlling the lighting direction.  <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref>. Graph "hep-th" visualized directly (top) and with our edge simplification method (bottom), both laid out using FR. The blowup illustrates how the filtered version aids in the presentation of fine graph structure. Our experiments validate the complexity analysis of Section 4, with edge metric evaluation performance proportional to O(log(n) * m) on undirected graphs. We found that edge simplification can also improve the performance of the layout algorithm, by 18% on average. Because our simplification does not affect node count, the all pairs repulsive force computation dominates layout time. Experiments were performed on a modern workstation. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes our results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>We have discovered, through the course of filtering edges to remove distracting edge crossings in large non-planar graphs, that reducing edge count while maintaining node count facilitates faster and better appearing layouts. We have also discovered that limiting the computation of betweenness centrality to using shortest paths between highdegree hubs of power-law graphs reduces the time complexity class of its computation with little cost in visual fidelity. Finally, we have implemented these tools in an interactive graph visualization system that supports additional high-quality graphics rendering modes that accentuate the hubs in overview visualizations of large scale-free networks.
