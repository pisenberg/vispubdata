			<abstract>
				<p>Data transformation, the process of preparing raw data for effective visualization, is one of the key challenges in information visualization. Although researchers have developed many data transformation techniques, there is little empirical study of the general impact of data transformation on visualization. Without such study, it is difficult to systematically decide when and which data transformation techniques are needed. We thus have designed and conducted a two-part empirical study that examines how the use of common data transformation techniques impacts visualization quality, which in turn affects user task performance. Our first experiment studies the impact of data transformation on user performance in single-step, typical visual analytic tasks. The second experiment assesses the impact of data transformation in multi-step analytic tasks. Our results quantify the benefits of data transformation in both experiments. More importantly, our analyses reveal that (1) the benefits of data transformation vary significantly by task and by visualization, and (2) the use of data transformation depends on a user&apos;s interaction context. Based on our findings, we present a set of design recommendations that help guide the development and use of data transformation techniques.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In real-world applications, raw data often are not in a "pristine" form that is ready to be visualized and viewed by users. In such cases, the data must be transformed before they can be effectively visualized. For example, raw data may be noisy and need to be cleaned to avoid visual distortion. Inherently complex data may also need to be transformed first (e.g., clustering) to facilitate user comprehension of the resulting visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Traditionally, human visualization experts decide when and which data transformations are needed. They manually select and apply the needed transformations to a given data set and then create a visualization of the transformed data <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. However, such a process becomes impractical in meeting the demands of making information visualization an analytic appliance for the masses <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. In these cases, average users, who often have limited knowledge of information visualization let alone data transformation, need to use visualization to analyze massive amounts of data. Moreover, many real-world applications such as intelligence analysis require the support of a much more dynamic and flexible process, where both the specific analytic goals and the exact data to be analyzed may be unknown a priori <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</p><p>To meet the challenges described above, we envision a smart visualization system, which can assist average users who are not visualization experts in their analytic tasks. Unlike most visualization systems, where the data to be analyzed and the type of visualization to be used are known in advance, our envisioned system supports highly dynamic, interactive visual analysis. Given a user's request (e.g., creating a visual summarization of desired data), the system will dynamically recommend and create visualizations that are tailored to the user's analytic context (e.g., data properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>).</p><p>Due to the highly dynamic nature of user interaction, our envisioned system cannot anticipate specific data sets to be visualized or whether such a data set is suitable for producing a quality visualization. As a result, the system must dynamically determine which data transformations may be needed in response to a user's request. However, making such a decision is technically challenging, since a number of potentially conflicting factors may affect the decision. For example, data transformation such as sampling helps to reduce data volume and produce a less cluttered visualization. On the other hand, the benefit is achieved at the cost of information loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Therefore, the system must balance the benefit and cost of data transformation.</p><p>To justify and guide our effort in addressing this unique challenge, our first step is to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the impact of data transformation on visualization in various situations. To the best of our knowledge, we are unaware of any existing work that can satisfy our needs. We thus have designed and conducted our own study, which answers two sets of questions:</p><p>• How much do common data transformation techniques (e.g., data sampling) help users to perform typical visual analytic tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>)? Where do we see the significant benefits (e.g., for a particular type of visualization) so we can focus on developing data transformation techniques in these areas to best exploit the benefits? • How much do common data transformations help users to perform multi-step tasks where the data set to be visualized may change at every step? In such a process, whether and what run-time factors, including a user's past interactions, would influence the choices of data transformation? To address the first set of questions, we have designed and conducted an experiment to study the impact of data transformation on user performance in a set of typical visual analytic tasks. To answer the second set of questions, we have designed and conducted a second experiment to examine the impact of data transformation on user performance in multi-step analytic tasks. We report our observations and analyses in both experiments. We qualitatively and quantitatively assess the impact of data transformation on user task performance under various visualization conditions. We also discuss the implications of our findings to our own work and to the wider information visualization community.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: we first provide a brief discussion of related work. We then describe our two experiments, including their design, results, and analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Our work is directly related to research on data transformation for visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Researchers have developed a number of data transformation techniques to ensure the creation of effective visualization. Chi has summarized data transformations used for a set of well-known visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. To better visualize categorical data, <ref type="bibr">Ma</ref>  order nominal data <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. More recently, transformation techniques such as hierarchical dimension ordering <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and ranked low-dimensional projections <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> are introduced to better organize highdimensional data for visualization. While learning specific transformation techniques from these works, here we systematically investigate the general impact of data transformation on visualization, in turn on user task performance.</p><p>In the information visualization community, researchers have also designed and conducted many empirical studies. These studies range from examining specific visualization techniques (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>) to evaluating the quality of visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. There is one empirical study on comparing specific data transformation techniques that prepare high-dimensional data for visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. However, we are unaware of any empirical studies like ours, which comprehensively examine the impact of data transformation in a wide variety of visualization situations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">EXPERIMENT 1</head><p>Our first experiment was designed to understand the impact of data transformation on user performance in single-step, typical visual analytic tasks. Our study quantitatively and qualitatively compared user task performance using visualizations of transformed and nontransformed data. The result analyses characterized visualization situations where data transformation is most beneficial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Design and Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Experimental system</head><p>In this comparative study, we employed ManyEyes for its web accessibility and its support of high-quality visualizations of diverse data sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. For the purpose of our experiment, we augmented ManyEyes to include additional visualizations, such as parallel coordinates, to meet the visualization needs required by our study.</p><p>We implemented four most commonly used data transformation techniques <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>: nominal value ordering <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, dimension ordering <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, data sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and data cleaning <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The scope of our study is not to cover a complete space of data transformation. Instead, we focus on these techniques for four reasons. First, these are general transformation techniques easily applicable to a wide variety of data sets. Second, they represent three distinctive types of typical data operations: (1) data pattern extraction (nominal value ordering and dimension ordering), (2) data volume or complexity reduction (sampling), and (3) data cleaning. Third, it is easy to implement these techniques and tune their parameters to suit a specific data set. Fourth, we can use simple data properties to estimate the usefulness of these techniques for a given data set. For example, if the volume of a data set is large, the sampling technique may be useful. The last criterion is especially relevant to our goal, which is to dynamically select proper data transformations for a given data set during a human-machine visual dialog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Tasks</head><p>To make our study comprehensive yet manageable, we carefully scope the visualization conditions under which we were to examine the impact of data transformation. Specifically, we characterize each visualization condition along two dimensions: the type of task being performed and the type of visualization being used. As described below, not only can these two dimensions be rigorously defined, but their combinations can also cover a wide variety of typical visualization situations.</p><p>Type of user tasks. Existing work has identified a number of user tasks that can be facilitated by visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. Among these tasks, we decided to focus on three most common types of tasks to control the study scope but still retain the generality of our results. These three types of tasks are: look up, comparison, and distribution. Here are the examples for each type of tasks:</p><p>• Look up: Name the town with the smallest population.</p><p>• Comparison: Compare house prices in two cities: New York and Chicago. • Distribution: Characterize the twin birth rate over the last 30 years in the U.S.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Type of visualization.</head><p>Since we aim to help average users in their tasks, we focused on the use of common visualizations to support the three types of tasks listed above. We adopted four types of visualization from ManyEyes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>), which accounted for nearly 80% of the usage among ManyEyes users. To achieve a balanced, within-subject comparison that covers our entire study space (3 types of tasks, 4 types of visualizations, with or without the use of data transformation), we designed a total of 24 (= 3×4×2) independent tasks. These 24 tasks were divided in 12 (=3×4) pairs, each of which included two similar but not identical tasks: one to be performed with visualization of transformed data  and the other with visualization of non-transformed data. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows a pair of such tasks and the complete task list is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. For each task, we designed a multiple choice question for a study participant to answer ( <ref type="table">Table 2)</ref>.</p><p>In each task, we used a set of guidelines to determine the applicable data transformation(s) for the given data set. Based on the existing work <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, we formulated our guidelines to cover various data properties:</p><p>• Use data sampling first if data volume is large.</p><p>• Use data cleaning if data appears to be noisy (e.g., the "local outlier factor" is large). • Use nominal value ordering if similarity metrics can be easily defined to cluster data instances. • Use dimension ordering if there are more than three data dimensions. Based on these guidelines, two transformation techniques were applied to the data set of task A mentioned in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>To avoid biases toward particular data transformation techniques, we made effort to ensure the diversity of data used in our study. For 24 tasks, we chose 24 data sets from 2,100+ data sets contributed by more than 1,400 users on ManyEyes. Among the 24 selected data sets, the number of data dimensions ranged from 2 to 16, and the number of data instances ranged from 30 to 27433. Furthermore, we carefully designed each task to ensure: (1) the task would be best achieved using a visualization, and (2) the visualization used to help achieve the task was indeed the most proper one. These criteria helped to eliminate potential biases toward improper or ineffective use of visualization in our study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Participants</head><p>We recruited twenty participants. There were twelve males and eight females. Their ages varied from mid 20's to early 50's. To fit the profile of average users whom we target to help, none of our participants was an visualization expert. They all had some experience with general visualization tools (e.g., web-based map tools), but none of them had previous experience with the specific visualization tools used in our experiment. In addition, they are not experts on data transformation techniques, but they all had general knowledge about data properties such as noisy data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.4">Methodology</head><p>We used a within-subject comparison methodology. We asked each participant to perform all 24 tasks. Among the 24 tasks, 12 would be completed using visualizations of non-transformed data, and the other 12 using visualizations of transformed data. To avoid potential biases like learning effects, we permuted the order and conditions of tasks to cover all combinations.</p><p>Before each task, a participant was given a profiling questionnaire to indicate his/her expertise level and frequency of using visualization tools. We gave each participant a 15-minute tutorial, in which we taught the participant how to use the visualization tools required by the experiment.</p><p>For each task, the participant was first given the task description and the question to be answered. An interactive visualization was then given for the participant to perform the task. We recorded the task completion time, which was counted from the moment when the participant was given the visualization to the moment when the participant claimed that the task was completed. To prevent a participant from spending too much time on one task, we allotted three minutes per task. If a participant failed to complete a task within the allotted time, we marked the task failed and asked the participant to move on to the next task.</p><p>After each task, we collected the participant's subjective feedback. First, we asked the participant whether the visualization s/he just used had helped to achieve the task. The answers to this question would help us to understand the baseline-whether the visualization helps at all for the given task. Second, we asked the participant to rate the usefulness of the visualization that s/he just used in the task against an alternative visualization on three scales: better, worse, or similar. If the participant had used a visualization of transformed data in the task, the alternative visualization would be the visualization of non-transformed data, or vice versa. We also asked the participant about the rationale for his/her choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Results and Analysis</head><p>We quantitatively analyzed the collected data to assess the impact of data transformation on user task performance using both objective (task completion time and task error rate) and subjective measures (participants' subjective feedback).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Task completion time</head><p>We first computed the mean task completion time over all the tasks and participants under two settings: with data transformation enabled and disabled <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . With data transformation enabled, the mean completion time was 36 seconds, while the mean completion time was 72 seconds with data transformation disabled <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2a</ref>). The improvement was 50%. A repeated measure variance analysis showed that such a difference was statistically significant: F(1, 100) = 107, p &lt; 1e-5.</p><p>We then analyzed how various factors might have impacted Transformation Data sampling and clustering None <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. An example pair of tasks used in Experiment 1.</p><p>1 As a standard practice, in our analysis we applied log transformation on timing data to normalize the distribution. Error rate(%) w/ transformation w/o transformation the task completion time. An ANOVA test found that both task type (F(2, 100)=11.4, p&lt;0.001) and visualization type (F(3, 100)=33.1, p&lt;1e-7) had influenced the task completion time significantly <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3)</ref>. A post-hoc test further identified that the use of data transformation had significantly improved the task completion time in three visualization situations: (1) type 4 visualization (map) for any type of task, (2) type 3 visualization (e.g., network diagram) for comparison and distribution tasks, and (3) type 2 visualization (e.g., line graph) for distribution tasks.</p><p>To better understand these results, we further examined the nature of the tasks and the corresponding visualizations used. From our observations, more difficult tasks like identifying data trend or distribution often required users to perform more visual explorations before they could reach their conclusions. Complex visualizations like diagrams (Type 3 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>) and maps (Type 4 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>) often encoded complex data sets and required users to spend more time to understand the data. Under these already difficult conditions, should the non-transformed data (e.g., noisy data) further decrease the effectiveness of the intended visualization, a user's task performance would be severely impaired. In such situations, data transformations becomes most beneficial, since it reduces the number of visual explorations needed to complete the task. This helps explain our above results that data transformation is more valuable when complex tasks are to be accomplished or complex visualizations are to be created.</p><p>Except the task type and visualization type, our analysis found that other factors had little impact on the completion time. For example, the completion time was not affected by the participants' self-rated expertise level (F(3, 100) = 0.346, p = 0.79) or the frequency of using visualization tools (F(3, 100) = 1.25, p = 0.29).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Task error rate</head><p>Our second task performance metric, task error rate, measures the percentage of tasks that the user successfully completed. Our analysis found that the mean error rate across all tasks and participants was reduced from 42.1% (without data transformation) to 6.0% (with data transformation), a 86% reduction <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2b)</ref>. A repeated measure variance analysis showed that this improvement was statistically significant: F(1, 100) = 90.1, p &lt; 1e-7.</p><p>Similarly, an ANOVA test found both the task type (F(2, 100) = 35.5, p&lt;1e-7) and visualization type (F(3, 100)=13.1, p&lt;1e-7) had impacted the error rate significantly. A post-hoc test further identified two visualization situations under which data transforma-tion had helped to reduce the error rate significantly: 1) type 4 visualization (map) for any type of task; and 2) distribution tasks ( <ref type="figure">Figure  4</ref>). Again, these findings suggested that data transformation be more useful for difficult tasks and complex visualizations.</p><p>Again, neither the participants' expertise level (F(3, 100)= 0.387, p=0.76) nor the frequency of using visualization (F(2, 100) = 0.601, p=0.55) had any significant impact on the error rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Subjective measures</head><p>Based on the user feedback collected at the end of each task, we compared the participants' choices between visualizations with and without data transformations.</p><p>Our participants overwhelmingly favored visualizations of transformed data, although they were not aware of the fact when they made such a choice. Out of 480 trials (24 tasks × 20 participants), the participants preferred the visualizations of transformed data in 376 trials (78.5%). Visualizations of non-transformed data were preferred in 23 trials (4.6%). For the remaining 81 trials (16.9%), the participants thought the two visualizations were similar. An ANOVA test showed that task type (F(2, 100)=23.0, p&lt;1e-7) and visualization type (F(3, 100)=6.15, p&lt;0.001) were the only two factors that significantly impacted the participants' preferences. Whether the visualization was actually used in the task did not have a significant impact on user preferences (F(1, 100) = 0.74, p=0.39).</p><p>To better understand the rationale behind their preferences, we further studied the participants' comments. Based on their comments, users preferred the visualizations of transformed data for two main reasons: (1) visualizations of transformed data were more legible and less cluttered, and (2) visualizations of transformed data directly provided needed information that was otherwise hidden and required much user effort to obtain.</p><p>In more than half of the cases (55% of 376 trials) where users preferred the visualizations of transformed data, the corresponding visualizations of non-transformed data were illegible or cluttered. Here is a comment from a participant after using the map tool <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 5 a1-a2)</ref>:</p><p>"The map [of non-transformed data] was distorted and had too many occlusions. I couldn't see the town names under the houses. I had to guess the names even after zooming in." In this case, the distortion caused by noisy data and the visual clutter hid the needed information (i.e., town names).</p><p>In the rest of 45% cases, users indicated that visualizations of non-transformed data did not provide the needed information and   A similar comment was given on interacting with a parallel coordinates <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 5b1-b2)</ref>:</p><p>"The interaction for re-ordering axes was kind of awkward. So I like the alternative plot [of transformed data]. There I could find answers without much interaction."</p><p>The above comments indicated that inherent limitations (e.g., interactivity and performance) in a visualization tool could make a task more difficult. In such cases, data transformation is highly valuable, since a visualization of properly transformed data would reduce user effort to complete the task.</p><p>Similarly, our participants appreciated visualizations of transformed data if these visualizations helped them to easily derive data insight. Below is a representative comment on a pair of visualizations like <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> (c1-c2):</p><p>"The alternative plot [of transformed data] was more helpful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I could immediately see the pattern of distribution. When I was doing the task [with the plot of non-transformed data], I had to inspect each town one by one to answer the question."</head><p>Although our participants preferred visualizations of transformed data in 78.5% cases, there were nearly a quarter (22.5%) of cases where visualizations of transformed data were not favored. We examined these cases and our findings are two-fold.</p><p>First, inherent limitations in a visualization tool could reduce the benefit of data transformation. For example, in our study two line graphs of transformed and non-transformed data were considered similar. The line graph used in our study was very limited and only allowed the use of color instead of position to group lines together. The choices of color were also limited. As a result, it could not take full advantage of the transformed data. Specifically, the transformed data produced an ordered set of lines, which could not be encoded by the line graphs used in the experiment. The comment from a participant confirmed our analysis:</p><p>"The positions of the lines were more important to me. The color grouping didn't make much difference. The small contrast of the colors did not help either."</p><p>Second, the benefit of data transformation was not evident for very simple visualizations. For example, the bar chart used in our experiment only supported selection but not zooming. One participant commented:</p><p>"This bar chart [of transformed data] looked better. But there was only one way [selecting bars] to find the answer. So the two charts were basically the same for the task."</p><p>We also found explanations for cases where visualization of transformed data were considered worse. The main culprit was the loss of information due to transformation. Here is a comment from a participant on a network diagram showing a set of sampled nodes and links:</p><p>" Finally, we checked participants' comments for potential biases toward the possible misuse of visualizations for designated tasks. Only in 4 trials out of 480 trials (0.83%), two participants commented that other visualizations or alternative data presentations like data tables might better help to accomplish the tasks. Therefore, we felt confident that we had used the proper visualizations for most of the tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Results Summary and Recommendations</head><p>Our first experiment demonstrates that standard data transformations significantly improve user task performance, especially in helping reduce their task completion time (50%) and task error rate (86%). Among various factors, the task type and visualization type are the only two factors that have significant impact on the usefulness of data transformation. Specifically, data transformation is more valuable to users when they perform difficult tasks or use complex visualizations. Users' subjective ratings and comments concurred with our findings.</p><p>Based on our findings, we make the following recommendations that may be used to guide the development and application of <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Visualizations for 3 tasks. Display (a1) shows a set of houses on map; Display (b1) shows five attributes of a set of colleges; Display (c1) shows house prices (Y axis) in a set of towns (X axis). Displays (a1), (b1), (c1) are created using non-transformed data. Displays (a2) is created using data after cleaning. Display (b2) is created using data after sampling and dimension ordering, Display (c2) is created using data after nominal value ordering.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(a1) (b1) (c1) (a2) (b2)<label>(c2)</label></formula><p>data transformation techniques.</p><p>Types of transformation techniques. Our result analyses show that different transformation techniques have different effects on a visualization. Based on the data transformation effects observed in the study, we abstract three types of transformation techniques:</p><p>• Regulatory techniques: clean and normalize data (e.g., outlier separation technique). • Scaling techniques: adjust data volume and complexity (e.g., sampling technique). • Organizational techniques: identify inherent structures of data and organize the data accordingly (e.g., nominal value ordering technique).</p><p>Guidelines of applying data transformation. Our results quantitatively identify that data transformation is more beneficial when users perform difficult tasks (e.g., distribution tasks), or use complex visualizations (e.g., complex diagrams like parallel coordinates). To best exploit the benefits of data transformation, we should probably target developing transformation techniques supporting these tasks and visualizations first. Based on the identified characteristics of these tasks and visualizations, we derive a set of usage guidelines for data transformation. These guidelines are based on the ones used in our study (Section 3. If not careful, the interpretation of data may be subverted. For example, a connected graph may appear disconnected after data sampling. To avoid misinterpretations, data transformation should always try to maintain the truthfulness of data. These abstracted features provide a starting point for us to develop computational metrics that formalize the benefit of data transformation. This is a critical step toward our goal, which is to let a system dynamically decide whether and what data transformation is needed for a given situation. To do so, the system must be able to computationally evaluate and compare the visualization quality before and after the use of data transformation. Using the three features, the system can select transformation that maximizes visual legibility and pattern recognizability, while ensures visual fidelity. The three features may also be assigned different weights based on task types. For example, visual pattern recognizability may have higher weight in distribution tasks than in look up tasks.</p><p>Types of task scenarios. Based on both the objective and subjective data collected in our study, we were also able to identify three typical task scenarios, which influence when and how data transformation should be determined.</p><p>• Predictable scenarios. In scenarios where data and tasks can be predicated, data transformation may be pre-planned. • Unpredictable scenarios where users are knowledgeable.</p><p>Because users have a certain understanding in data and data transformation, the users may prefer to have the full control in driving the use of data transformation. • Unpredictable scenarios where users have limited knowledge in visualization or data transformation. These are our target scenarios. In such cases, data transformation needs to be dynamically selected. However the selected data transformation(s) may not always be desirable due to the system's limited knowledge of user context. To ensure user satisfaction, we suggest that the system let users be aware of the transformation used and allow them to adjust the transformation in a limited way. For example, let users change the ratio in data sampling transformation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">EXPERIMENT 2</head><p>Our first experiment examined the impact of data transformation on user performance in single-step visual analytic tasks. Our second experiment was designed to study the impact of data transformation in multi-step analytic tasks with dynamically changing data at every step. In particular, we would like to study how a user's evolving context impacts the choice and benefit of data transformation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Design and Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Experimental system</head><p>For this experiment, we built a Wizard-of-OZ (WOZ) system that let a human moderator to respond to a participant's analytic request. Given a request, the moderator dynamically chose the desired data set, the type of visualization, and the needed data transformations.</p><p>The WOZ system would then create an interactive visualization for the given data. It supported all four types of data transformations and a sub-set of visualizations used in Experiment 1. To achieve fast response time, our WOZ system let the moderator use a GUI to quickly specify a data set, visualization type, and data transformations. For example, given a user request "houses under $600K", the moderator would (1) enter a data constraint in a GUI constraint box price&lt;$600K, (2) select the map visualization from a check list of available visualizations, and (3) select a data cleaning transformation from a check list of available transformation techniques. The moderator could also customize the parameters of a selected transformation technique in the GUI. To assist the selection of data transformations, we implemented a set of procedures that automatically extract data properties of a given data set (e.g., data volume and outlier factor). Based the guidelines in Section 3.3, the moderator would use the extracted data properties, the task type implied by the request, and the chosen type of visualization to select suitable data transformations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Tasks</head><p>In this experiment, we studied the impact of data transformation on user performance in exploratory tasks. In such tasks, users were asked to explore the data space and find one or more data targets that meet a set of fuzzy criteria (e.g., cheap houses in good school districts). We chose to focus on multi-criteria, exploratory search tasks for two reasons. First, users often need to take multiple steps to explore the data space and balance the criteria. Thus, a user's interaction context plays an important role in such tasks. In this experiment, such behavior would help us study whether and how the context may influence the choice of data transformation. Second, exploratory search still allows us to objectively compare user performance (e.g., task completion time and error rate).</p><p>In this experiment, we designed two similar but not identical exploratory search tasks in the real estate domain. In one task, the criteria to be traded off for target houses were: 1) large, 2) cheap, and 3) in good school districts. In the other task, the criteria were: 1) new, 2) expensive, and 3) close to water. We used a realistic data set obtained from multiple listing services, which included 2000+ houses, 70+ towns, and 400+ schools. The data set covered 25+ distinctive data concepts (e.g., house and city), each with a number of attributes (e.g., a house has 40 attributes, and a city has 25).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Participants and Methodology</head><p>The participants in our first experiment were invited in this experiment. Similarly, we employed a within-subject methodology. Each participant was asked to perform both tasks described above, one with data transformation enabled and the other disabled. We allotted 15 minutes for each task and permuted the task order to cover all combinations.</p><p>In each task, a participant was first given a task description. S/ he could then make a request to evaluate any of the three criteria. However, s/he must use concrete constraints to evaluate a fuzzy criterion, e.g., using "price&lt;$600K" for the "cheap" criterion. The participant could evaluate new criteria in the context of or independent of his/her previous exploration. For example, s/he might evaluate the "large" criterion in the context of "cheap" houses found so far. The participant could also interact with the generated visualization to examine the retrieved data.</p><p>Each task ended when the participant claimed to have completed the task or the allotted time was up. The participant was asked to record the data target(s) found and the rationale substantiating their findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results and Analysis</head><p>Like in our first experiment, we used the task completion time and error rate to quantitatively analyze the impact of data transformation on user task performance. We then examined how run-time factors, such as a user's past interactions (i.e., interaction history), had impacted the use of data transformations over the course of a task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Task completion time</head><p>In addition to computing the overall task completion time, we analyzed the time spent at each step of a task. We timed a step from the moment when a participant was shown a visualization to the moment when the participant made his/her next request 2 . Steps were also indexed by the order as they occurred. These measures let us study the impact of data transformation on different stages of a task. An ANOVA test showed that the use of data transformation (F(1, 92)=29.0, p&lt;1e-4) and the index of a step (F(5, 92)=27.4, p&lt;1e-7) had significantly impacted the time spent at each step. Neither the search criterion (F(2, 92)=0.30, p=0.74) nor the task order (F(1, 92)=2.81, p=0.10) had any significant impact.</p><p>Furthermore, we performed a linear regression analysis between two variables: the time spent at a step and the index of a step. We examined their relationships in two conditions: with or without data transformation. The results indicated that data transformation helped to reduce the task time more at earlier steps of a task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 6a</ref>). Our observations and the participants' comments provided us explanations to this phenomenon. At the beginning of a task, the participants were exploring the data space to get an understanding of the space. In these steps, the participants typically worked with larger and complex data sets. Consistent with our findings in Experiment 1, data transformation greatly helped users in these difficult situations.</p><p>We also studied the impact of data transformation on the total number of steps needed to complete the tasks. An ANOVA test with a post-hoc test <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 6b</ref>) showed that the use of data transformation was the only factor that had significant impact on the number of steps taken: F(1, 32) = 17.0, p &lt; 0.001; and it helped to reduce the number of steps (mean value) significantly from 4.60 (without transformation) to 3.70 steps (with transformation).</p><p>Finally, we examined the overall task completion time. An ANOVA test showed the use of data transformation was the only factor that significantly affected the overall completion time: F(1, 32) = 17.0, p &lt; 0.001. A post-hoc test also showed that the mean task completion time was significantly reduced from 741 seconds (without data transformation) to 416 seconds (with data transformation), amounting to 43.9% reduction <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 6c</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Task error rate</head><p>We asked two domain experts who had extensive real estate knowledge and were familiar with the data set to score the targets found by the participants. The score was between 0 and 1 depending on how well the found targets satisfied the given criteria. An ANOVA test with post-hoc analysis showed that mean value of the error rate was reduced from 11.0% (without data transformation) to 3.5% (with data transformation). However, the difference was not statistically significant <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 6d</ref>). Compared to Experiment 1, the benefit was also greatly reduced. Based on our observations, we attributed the reduced benefit to two main reasons. First, in Experiment 1, the participants had only one visualization to get the needed information. In contrast, in Experiment 2, the participants could get needed information from multiple steps. For example, a participant might not be able to identify certain town names on a map at one step, but s/he could see the names at other steps. Second, in Experiment 2 the participants could re-evaluate previous criteria if they later found they had made mistakes. But they could not do so in Experiment 1. In general, regardless the use of data transformation, Experiment 2 was more forgiven in terms of affording users' mistakes during their tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Impact of run-time factors on data transformation</head><p>Our second experiment was also designed to examine whether and which run-time factors might influence the choices of data transformation used over the course of a task. Here, a choice of data transformation (d i ), which included one or more transformation techniques like sampling and cleaning, was made at a user step (s i ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> We excluded steps for timing where empty visualization was generated due to the empty data retrieved for a user's request. In addition, there were three run-time factors associated with a step: (1) the search criteria used (q i ), (2) the type of visualization used (v i ), and (3) a sequence of user steps leading to this step (seq i )-a user's interaction history.</p><p>To quantitatively analyze the relationships between the three run-time factors (v i , q i , seq i ) and the choices of data transformations (d i ), we "normalized" the collected data. We collected a total of 74 sets of data transformation used, representing seven distinct choices. We also clustered all 74 sequences (seq i ) into six groups based on their similarity. The similarity between two sequences were measured from three aspects: (1) the query used at each step, (2) the properties of the query results (e.g., data volume and outlier factor), and (3) the type of visualization used at each step.</p><p>An ANOVA test showed that all three run-time factors significantly impacted the choices of data transformation: the user's interaction history (F(5, 67) = 12.2, p &lt; 1e-4), the search criteria (F(2, 67) = 15.2, p &lt; 1e-4), and the type of visualization (F(4, 67) = 6.40, p &lt; 0.001). We then performed a linear regression test to understand the contributions of each of the three factors to the choices of data transformation. Our regression result showed that the user's interaction history accounted for the biggest portion of the variances in the data transformation (32% vs. less than 1% for other two factors). This confirmed our hypothesis that a user's interaction context, especially the interaction history, influences the choices of data transformation. As a result, data transformations must be derived dynamically in a user's analytic context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Result Summary and Recommendations</head><p>Like Experiment 1, our second experiment verified that common data transformations significantly improved user performance in multi-step tasks. Moreover, it showed that a user's interaction context significantly influenced the choice of data transformation.</p><p>Based on these findings, we form two recommendations to guide the use of data transformation in support of multi-step analysis tasks. First, the choice of data transformation should be evaluated at every interaction step, especially at earlier stages of a long task. As shown in our study, data transformation helps improve user task performance (task completion time) significantly in earlier stages of a task. Second, we could leverage the state information (e.g., data exploratory stage versus data lookup stage) to guide the selection of data transformation. For example, data scaling may be useful (e.g., sampling) to provide users with an overview of the data space at an exploratory stage, but may not be desirable when users intend to make fine-grained data comparison.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Data transformation, like data cleaning and sampling, prepares raw data for effective visualization. In this paper, we present two comparative experiments on examining how data transformation impacts user task performance in various visualization situations (e.g., varied tasks and the types of visualization used). Our analyses show that data transformation significantly improves user performance in both single-step and multi-step analytic tasks. The benefit of data transformation is most significant in difficult tasks or with the use of complex visualization tools. Our experiments also conclude that a user's interaction context dictates the choices of data transformation. Therefore, data transformations must be derived dynamically based on a user's interaction context.</p><p>Based on our findings, we have made several recommendations to guide the development and use of data transformation to best exploit its benefit. Specifically, we have identified three types of data transformation techniques that help to produce a quality visualization. We have also abstracted a set of guidelines that suggests when and what types of data transformation are most useful. To systematically assess the benefit of data transformation, we have extracted three visualization quality measures, the result indicators of data transformation. Finally, we have suggested that a user's interaction context, such as the state of a task, be used to help decide the need and type of data transformation in context.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Four types of visualizations in the Experiment 1.
