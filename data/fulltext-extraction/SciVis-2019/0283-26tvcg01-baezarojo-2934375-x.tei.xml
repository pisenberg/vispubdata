			<abstract>
				<p>The topological analysis of unsteady vector fields remains to this day one of the largest challenges in flow visualization. We build up on recent work on vortex extraction to define a time-dependent vector field topology for 2D and 3D flows. In our work, we split the vector field into two components: a vector field in which the flow becomes steady, and the remaining ambient flow that describes the motion of topological elements (such as sinks, sources and saddles) and feature curves (vortex corelines and bifurcation lines). To this end, we expand on recent local optimization approaches by modeling spatially-varying deformations through displacement transformations from continuum mechanics. We compare and discuss the relationships with existing local and integration-based topology extraction methods, showing for instance that separatrices seeded from saddles in the optimal frame align with the integrationbased streakline vector field topology. In contrast to the streakline-based approach, our method gives a complete picture of the topology for every time slice, including the steps near the temporal domain boundaries. With our work it now becomes possible to extract topological information even when only few time slices are available. We demonstrate the method in several analytical and numerically-simulated flows and discuss practical aspects, limitations and opportunities for future work.</p>

Features may not only be relevant for an analysis task, they also provide entry points for visual exploration, data reduction and vector field design. A key problem of feature-based vector field analysis is the dependence of the flow vectors on the chosen frame of reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. Thus, recent feature definitions aimed for a reference frame invariance, making them invariant to certain types of motion, such as equal-speed translations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">57]</ref> (known as Galilean invariance) or time-dependent rotations and translations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> (known as objectivity). Recent work concentrated on the selection of an appropriate reference frame, for instance by a flow decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">62]</ref>, an adjustment to features <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, machine learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> or a linear optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. At present, reference frame optimizations have only been applied to vortex extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we aim for an unsteady vector field topology based on reference frame optimizations, including topological elements (such as critical points and separatrices) and feature curves (such as vortex corelines and bifurcation lines). There are two types of approaches to unsteady vector field topology: local methods that observe only a single time slice, and integration-based methods. Local methods include the traditional streamline-oriented topology, which is known to not capture the behavior of pathlines <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57]</ref>. Integration-based methods require the tracing of particles over time, e.g., the streakline-based topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> or flow map analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Integration-based methods become inaccurate or even undefined near the temporal domain boundaries, since they have to be able to observe particle behavior in the past and in the future.</p><p>Our local method is based on a suitable vector field decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> that splits a time-dependent vector field into two components: a vector field in which the flow becomes steady (which contains topological elements and features) and a second vector field that contains the ambient motion (describing where the elements move to). To formally model the motion of topological elements and features, we propose to use displacement fields from non-linear continuum mechanics <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, which naturally extend the concept of affine invariance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> to more general types of spatially-varying motions. We show later that all currently existing classes of reference frame invariance appear as special cases. Since the decomposition is local in space and time, we can extract topological information everywhere in the domain, including near the temporal domain boundaries. In contrast to the global optimization method of Hadwiger et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, our approach has a lower memory consumption, is an order of magnitude faster and has a smaller time partial residual. In the paper, we make the following contributions:</p><p>We use a reference frame optimization to define topological elements and features in the frame in which the flow becomes steady.</p><p>We generalize the affine-invariant reference frame optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> to inhomogeneous displacement transformations in order to increase the accuracy, and compare our method with existing local and global optimizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p><p>We apply the ambient motion field to the space-time tracking of critical points (2D and 3D) and feature curves (vortex corelines and bifurcation lines in 3D) in optimal reference frames.</p><p>We compare our local optimization-based bifurcation line extraction with previous local and global approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref> and discuss the relationship with FTLE.</p><p>Regarding topology, we concentrate on critical points and separatrices only. Our reference frame-based topology has potential to spur future work on other topological elements such as closed orbits, attachment/detachment points, boundary switches, saddle connectors and the various Hopf and fold bifurcations. Our formal characterization of motion provides the mathematical basis for an error quantification and a construction of ground truth examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Reference Frames 2.1.1 Reference Frame Invariances for Feature Extraction</head><p>Formal feature definitions often depend on the frame of reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Since the motion between observer and feature is relative, reference frame invariance has a critical consequence: Being invariant to motions of the observer equals the invariance to motions of the feature. Thus, reference frame invariance enables us to successfully detect features that are moving. In increasing order of generality, the following reference frame invariances have been studied in fluid mechanics and scientific visualization. Galilean invariance is the invariance of a measure under equal-speed translations of the reference frame <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57]</ref>. Rotation invariance is the invariance of a measure under equal-speed rotations of the reference frame around a known center of rotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Objectivity is the invariance of a measure under smooth rotations and translations of the reference frame. Objectivity has been studied in the context of vortex extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">48]</ref> decades ago, and recently has seen a comeback initiated by the work of Haller et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Finally, affine invariance is the invariance of a measure under smooth affine transformations of the reference frame <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. From a continuum mechanics perspective, all above reference frame transformations have in common that they are homogeneous deformations, which means that their rotations, translations and affine transformations are assumed to be spatially constant. In the context of a local reference frame optimization, this means that the transformation is assumed to be constant within the local neighborhood, which might not necessarily hold.</p><p>In this paper, we extend these concepts to inhomogeneous deformations, i.e., spatially-varying deformations. For this, we explicitly model the spatial dependence in our derivation. Ultimately, all above reference frame invariances are contained as special cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Towards a Special Reference Frame</head><p>The path towards reference frame optimizations, i.e., the selection of a favorable reference frame, originated in the fluid mechanics literature on vortex dynamics. Lugt <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and Robinson <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> similarly characterized a vortex by the observations of circular streamlines in a suitable reference frame. While Lugt requested a reference frame in which the flow is steady, Robinson suggested to search for a frame that follows the vortex center. In the 1970s, Lugt <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> already pointed out an important dilemma: A fluid is a continuum in which structures move non-uniformly. Therefore, it is not possible to find a single reference frame that moves with all structures at once. Perry and Chong <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> described this phenomenon at a jet in cross flow, in which vortices accelerate and become steady in different frames. It therefore became clear that a spatially-varying reference frame is necessary. For this reason, GÃ¼nther et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> introduced a linear optimization that searches at each grid point in a small local neighborhood for a rotation and translation in which the local neighborhood becomes steady. They extended the approach to affine transformations of the reference frame <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and found applications in vortex extraction of finite-sized objects in fluids <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Hadwiger et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> formulated the search as a global optimization, in which they restricted the individual observers to rigid motions. Such a global optimization allows for smoother solutions, but it is slow and has a high memory consumption. We argue that motion is determined by the local neighborhood and we thus use local optimizations. Recently, Kim and GÃ¼nther <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> used deep learning to extract a steady reference frame from data with noise and resampling artifacts. This approach increases the numerical robustness, but it needs sufficient training data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Steady Vector Field Topology</head><p>Steady vector field topology has been extensively researched <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">56]</ref> and is formed by critical points, their invariant manifolds and the integral curves that connect the invariant manifolds <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Helman and Hesselink <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref> introduced first-order critical points, attachment and detachment points, and separatrices to the visualization community. A separatrix is a streamline starting from a saddle in one of its Jacobians' eigenvector directions. By now, many more elements complete the topological skeleton, such as boundary switch points <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, closed streamlines <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">65]</ref> and boundary switch connectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[59]</ref>. Aside from first-order critical points, higher-order topological structures have been investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">53]</ref>. Classic steady vector field topology has no reference frame invariance and is therefore not applicable to study the asymptotic behavior of pathlines in time-dependent flows <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57]</ref>. Complementing the above topology, certain features such as vortex corelines and bifurcation lines likewise give order to 3D flows. However, these structures are not necessarily invariant manifolds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Unsteady Vector Field Topology</head><p>Theisel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52]</ref> distinguished between streamline-oriented and pathline-oriented topology. The latter observes the flow in the plane orthogonal to the pathline tangent in order to classify pathline sectors with attracting, repelling or saddle-like behavior. Haller <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> used finite-time Lyapunov exponents <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref> (FTLE) as approximations of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS). To identify hyperbolic trajectories, he proposed a hyperbolicity time measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and introduced a finite-time counterpart that requires hyperbolic behavior over a time window <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Fuchs et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> selected a reference frame in which both the acceleration of the original flow and the velocity in the transformed flow vanish. This approach is only Galilean invariant and they demonstrated that it does not solve the Beads problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[61]</ref>. Similarly, Bujack et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> chose extrema in the determinant of the Jacobian as feature to pin the reference frame, which is Galilean invariant. Further, Fuchs et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> introduced a local Galilean-invariant unsteadiness measure, which is the material derivative of the Jacobian. By Lagrangian smoothing, this measure searches for a Lagrangian frame that is as Galilean as possible. Based on the observation that FTLE converges to material structures at infinite integration duration [45], Germer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> computed flow maps over the full integration domain to obtain a variant of FTLE that is guaranteed to have no flux crossing. Sadlo and Weiskopf <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> suggested to calculate bifurcation lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> as intersections of forward and backward FTLE ridges, and replaced separatrices with generalized streaklines <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[63]</ref>, released from the bifurcation line. The method has later been extended to 3D <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54]</ref>. Their separatrices are limited to the locations that particles can reach in the finite time window, resulting in incomplete information near temporal domain boundaries. A local Galilean-invariant estimation of the 2D space-time bifurcation line was proposed by Machado et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, based on the parallel vectors (PV) formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> of the reduced velocity criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>. The local PV extraction is followed by an iterative tangent alignment to obtain an approximate bifurcation line that is a pathline. As a counterpart to closed streamlines, Wilde et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[64]</ref> extracted recirculation surfaces. We also refer to the surveys of Pobitzer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and Heine et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>To study topological elements and features, a number of flow decompositions have been proposed. Similar to Wiebel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[62]</ref>, Bhatia et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> removed a harmonic flow component, using a Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition. A split of the the flow into a steady flow and an ambient motion has been mentioned by GÃ¼nther and Theisel <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> in the context of vortex extraction, but has not yet been applied to extract elements of a topological skeleton or to extract bifurcation lines.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Displacement Transformation of a Vector Field</head><p>To describe a spatially and temporally-varying reference frame transformation, continuum mechanics gives us two approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>: domain deformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> and displacement transformations. In principal, both are very similar, though the latter allows us to derive a vector field decomposition more easily.

In addition, we extract bifurcation lines, their separating surfaces and vortex corelines.</p><p>Critical Points. The foundation of the traditional topological skeleton are critical points <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> , also called stationary points or singularities. We follow the first-order characterization of Helman and Hesselink <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.  <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>: Difference between the separatrices obtained with our local method and the streakline-based approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.

LIC slices show the flow in the optimal reference frame and pathlines (purple) were released in two sectors, showing that no particles cross the separatrices.</p><p>Separatrices. Separatrices segment the flow into areas of coherent behavior. In steady vector fields, and also in our optimal steady reference frame, they can be calculated by releasing particle trajectories from saddles. By connecting the curves over time t, separating surfaces are obtained in space-time. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> shows a space-time visualization of the separatrices extracted with our method and with the streakline-based topology of Sadlo and Weiskopf <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Our separatrices can be traced in each time slice separately using streamlines in w(x,t), whereas the streakline-based method releases pathlines forward and backward in time in v(x,t). Due to the limited time domain, their method cannot construct the full separating surfaces near the temporal domain boundaries. In 3D, we have three eigenvalues, two of them having the same sign. The two corresponding eigenvectors span a plane in which a streamsurface can be released. In the direction of the eigenvector with the oppositely signed eigenvalue, a streamline can be released in w.</p><p>Vortex Corelines and Bifurcation Lines. First-order vortex corelines and bifurcation lines are defined in 2D space-time and 3D using the parallel vectors operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> via w (âw)w, with constraints on the eigenvalues of the Jacobian. For vortex corelines, the eigenvalues must be complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. For a bifurcation line, the determinant measured in the plane orthogonal to the flow must be negative <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Note that these feature curves are not formally part of the topological skeleton, because they might not be invariant manifolds if they end in the domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Properties</head><p>Next, we emphasize two important properties of our decomposition.</p><p>Paths of 2D Critical Points are Pathlines. It turns out that every critical line x c (t) in the space-time domain of w(x,t), such as a bifurcation line or a vortex coreline, is a pathline in both v(x,t) and f(x,t). This is because these structures are critical points in the time slices of w, i.e., w(x c (t),t) = 0, and thus with v = w + f in Eq. (1) their ambient motion is identical to the underlying flow:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">w(x c (t),t) = 0 â v(x c (t),t) = f(x c (t),t)<label>(29)</label></formula><p>This property is in alignment with the usual request that vortex corelines are tangential to the flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">57]</ref>. A theoretical consequence is that critical paths can be tracked in space-time as pathlines in the input unsteady flow v(x,t) or in the ambient motion f(x,t) in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. Note, however, that integration in v(x,t) can be extremely unstable, for instance, when tracing along a bifurcation line, since a tiny numerical error would lead to an exponential push off the bifurcation line. The field f(x,t), on the other hand, follows the feature on and in the vicinity of the critical point and thus integration of bifurcation lines is more stable, see the additional material for an example (Sect. 8). Stable feature flow fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref> could further reduce integration errors.</p><p>Generalization of Feature Flow Fields. Our ambient motion f(x,t) in Eq. (28) can be seen as generalization of the feature flow field <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[50]</ref> to arbitrary displacement transformations, since the traditional feature flow field f(x,t) = âJ â1 v t <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> appears as special case as the solution to Eq. (6) for Galilean displacement transformations, i.e., for âF t = 0 and F tt = 0. This connection inspired our naming of the ambient motion field as f(x,t).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">IMPLEMENTATION</head><p>Building up on the open source implementation of GÃ¼nther et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, we share a C++ demo implementation for the 2D case in the additional material. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the integration of the system matrix in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">24</ref>within neighborhood U can be done via summed-area tables (SAT). This speeds up the calculation, but it requires additional memory. In 2D, the system matrix size grows quadratic in the Taylor order. In 3D, it grows cubic, see the additional material. The SAT therefore grows very quickly in size, as shown in Section 7.8. Note, however, that our method is local and it is thus possible to compute only partial SATs for blocks of the data set, and to process the domain block-by-block. While our implementation processes the time slices sequentially and is partially OpenMP parallelized, there is still room for improvements. At each grid point, we solved the local linear system with a Householder QR decomposition with full-pivoting. We extracted critical points by recursive subdivision <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and computed vortex corelines and bifurcation lines in 2D space-time and in 3D with the parallel vectors operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Construction of Flow with Ground Truth Topology</head><p>In order to test our numerical optimization, we need a method to construct an analytical vector field where we know the ground truth positions of its topological elements. For this, we take the inverse approach: Given a steady vector field v * (x * ,t), we transform it backward with a known displacement transformation, resulting in a time-dependent vector field v(x,t). A backward displacement transformation of a vector field v * (x * ,t) is done by rearranging Eq. (3) to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">v(x,t) = [I + âF(x,t)] â1 (v * (x + F(x,t),t) â F t (x,t))<label>(30)</label></formula><p>This formulation allows us to sample the time-dependent test vector field v(x,t) onto a space-time grid (x,t). We can now use our optimization to recover the forward transformation F(x,t) from v(x,t), which takes us back to the steady vector field v * (x * ,t).</p><p>Modified Double Gyre. Inspired from Shadden's Double Gyre <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>, we construct a MODIFIED DOUBLE GYRE for our analytical ground truth topology. Shadden defined a steady vector field as co-gradient of a stream function. By deforming the stream function, the resulting time-dependent co-gradient vector field is divergence-free. However, this construction approach cannot control the location of features, such as vortex corelines and bifurcation lines. Instead, we apply a displacement transformation using Eq. (30) to compute our unsteady vector field v(x,t). With Eq. (29), we know that critical lines in the optimal frame w(x,t) are pathlines of v(x,t). In the domain [0, 2] Ã [â1, 1], vortex corelines pass through (x, y,t) = (1 Â± 0.5, Â±0.5, 0), and a bifurcation line passes through (x, y,t) = (1, 0, 0), see <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. The derivation of this construction is shown in the additional material (Sect. 7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Comparison with Previous Reference Frames 7.2.1 Comparison of Residuals on Ground Truth</head><p>Using our vector field with its ground truth transformation, we now compare the energy residuals, i.e., the transformed time partials, of previous methods with our approach for varying approximation orders. <ref type="figure">Fig. 4a</ref> depicts the input vector field and <ref type="figure">Fig. 4b</ref> displays the ground truth in the optimal frame. The two vortices are visible and there is no cross-flow across the separating structure in the middle. The generic objective method <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4c</ref> and our zero-order displacement optimization in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4e</ref> result in similar time partial residuals. The residuals w t (x,t) are color-coded with a heat color map. The global optimization of Hadwiger et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4d</ref> performed slightly better, followed by the affine-invariant method <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4f</ref>, which is equivalent to our first-order displacement optimization. All above four methods give very similar results with a RMSE time partial residual in the order of 10 â2 , still showing cross-flow across the separatrix. Significant improvements are made with our second-order displacement optimization in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4g</ref>, pushing the residual down to 10 â3 . The results become indistinguishable from the ground truth when using our third-order displacement optimization in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4h</ref>, which has an error in the order of 10 â4 . Aside from the improved accuracy, our local third-order method is an order of magnitude faster than the global approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.2">Comparison at Vortex Coreline Extraction</head><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>, we use the BOUSSINESQ flow to compute vortex corelines and compare our third-order optimization with previous reference frame optimizations. An approach to test the correctness of a vortex coreline in 2D space-time is to release pathlines from the coreline in order to see if the particles stay close to the coreline and swirl around it. The method of Hadwiger et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5a</ref> resulted in the smoothest reference frame, but missed weak corelines compared to the affine-invariant method <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5b</ref> and our third-order displacement optimization in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5c</ref>. Overall, all methods give fairly good results. If a smooth solution is preferred, the approach of Hadwiger remains a solid choice, while our displacement optimization is favorable when precision is key.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Comparison with Bifurcation Line Extractors</head><p>Next, we study another important feature curve: bifurcation lines.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.1">Comparison with FTLE Ridge Intersection</head><p>The intersection of forward and backward FTLE ridges has two problems. First, it requires an integration duration to be set and, as pointed  <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and global <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> approaches in space-time in the BOUSSINESQ flow. To confirm the correctness of the vortex corelines, particles are released on them and are integrated forward and backward. If a vortex coreline is a pathline, particles stay close and swirl around it. Our method has the lowest error and finds more vortices than the other two.</p><p>out by Shadden <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>, FTLE ridges converge to material lines in the limit of infinite integration duration. Therefore, integrating too short leads to wrong locations. Second, integrating too long results in false positives, since intersections also occur in other locations. <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> shows line integral convolutions of our optimal steady reference frame with an overlay of the FTLE ridges in forward (red) and backward (blue) direction for varying integration durations. For a short integration duration, the ridges are fuzzy and slightly off. For a longer duration, the intersection is more precise, but false-positives appear above and below the vortices. This experiment shows that saddles in our local reference frame correspond to integration-based FTLE ridge intersections. Sect. 8 of the additional material contains results for the PIPED CYLINDER.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.2">Comparison with Local and Integration-based Extractors</head><p>Next, we compare the local bifurcation line extractor of Machado et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and the FTLE ridge intersection of Sadlo and Weiskopf <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> with our displacement optimization. In <ref type="figure">Fig. 7a</ref>, our result for a secondorder displacement optimization is shown for the MODIFIED DOUBLE GYRE. The ground truth bifurcation line is always shown in yellow. From the three methods, our green coreline is the closest. The LIC slice in the background shows our optimal reference frame, clearly revealing the saddle. The intersection of FTLE ridges in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7b</ref> is slightly off, since the integration duration of Ï = 3 was too short. For longer integration durations, further ridges appear very quickly. Finally, the method of Machado et al. is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7c</ref>, which is clearly off, showing the acceleration field in the background. In 2D unsteady flows, critical points in the acceleration correspond to the PV locations in space-time <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Machado et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> applied an iterative refinement to align the extracted line with a pathline, but there is no guarantee that this will converge to the correct solution. To make PV extraction a valid option, we first need to move into the steady reference frame.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4">Comparison with Streakline-based Separatrices</head><p>Up until now, releasing generalized streaklines from a bifurcation line <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> was the only option for the extraction of separatrices, which requires particle integration through time. Instead, we extract separatrices directly in a single time slice of our optimal reference frame. The ground truth line is shown in yellow. The slices show the scalar or vector field, in which the lines are extracted. Note that our local approach finds the ground truth coreline best, closely followed by the FTLE intersection, which depends on the integration length.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.1">Separatrices Among Deforming Centers</head><p>Our first example is based on the four centers flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, but uses a different transformation by transforming the co-gradient of a stream function with a spatially-varying displacement transformation that not only rotates the domain but also has structures moving at different speed based on their location. The latter is a transformation that the affine-invariant method cannot fit too. The vector field and its transformation can be found in the additional material (Sect. 7). In <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>, we show separatrices obtained from individual slices in the affine-invariant reference frame, in our displacement optimized reference frames and with the streakline-based topology approach. Since the latter integrates pathlines, separatrices are only known where particles visit, giving an incomplete picture near the temporal domain boundary where only one direction (attracting or repelling) can be traced. This example demonstrates that our streamline-based separatrices in the optimal frame coincide with the streakline-based topology, but now we can compute the topology per time slice and thus trace the separatrices throughout the entire domain, not depending on particle integration through time.</p><p>To experimentally confirm the correctness of the separatrices, we released particles in two sectors of the domain and display their pathlines (purple) to observe that they do not cross our separatrices in space-time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.2">Separatrices in Compressible Flow</head><p>Next, we study the separatrices in a compressible vector field containing sinks, sources and saddles. For this, a vector field is constructed such that the separatrices are curved lines by using a steady vector field and a spiraling transformation. Details on the construction can be found in the additional material (Sect. 7). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 9</ref> displays the extracted separatrices in space-time. An indicator for the correctness of a bifurcation line is that the four separatrices, that were released in close proximity from the bifurcation line, result in four different separating surfaces. The streakline-based topology was also seeded from our bifurcation line, showing that four different surfaces appear. As before, our method gives the complete separating surfaces, connecting the saddles with  <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>: Comparisons of affine invariance, our third-order displacement transformation, and the streakline-based topology of Sadlo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> with bifurcation lines (yellow) and vortex corelines (green). The affineinvariant approach cannot fit the transformation perfectly and thus finds artificial bifurcation lines from which separatrices do not grow as from a real saddle. Purple lines show pathlines, which do not cross our separatrices. In the last image, our displacement-optimized separatrices are visualized transparently, showing that our method finds the complete surfaces. The LIC visualizes the flow in the respective optimal frame. The streakline-based separatrices cannot compute the separatrices everywhere. Our method, on the other hand, connects the saddles with the sink and source in each time slice.</p><p>both sink and source in all time slices.</p></div>

The vector field is defined in the additional material (Sect. 7). The optimal frame w(x,t) and the ambient motion f(x,t) are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 10</ref> for t = 5. Our optimization finds a reference frame in which the flow becomes steady, thereby turning the critical point into a spiraling sink. Thus, when vortex structures change the tangential velocity, we can expect a steady frame that is no longer divergence-free.</p></div>

The vortex corelines and bifurcation lines were computed with the parallel vectors operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> using our 3rd-order displacement optimization. The streakline-based method finds only small portions of the separatrices, since particles leave the domain early. Our local method extends these surfaces by tracing them in space only. The left and right part of the image show wrinkles in the separating surfaces due to temporal instability of the corelines. Below, a single time slice with longer separatices is shown. We can see that separatrices do not meet everywhere in the domain. This is perfectly consistent with the FTLE ridges in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> and is due to a temporal change that is not purely governed by the motion, cf. Section 7.5. We refer to the video for an animation, showing that particle motion is indeed governed by the separatrices.

Our next simulation contains two cylinder flows around two corners at Reynolds number Re = 160. Initially, a vortex street forms behind an obstacle, which then flows around two corners. Behind each corner, a standing vortex forms. The latter one blocks half of the flow to the second obstacle, creating a one-sided vortex street. A space-time illustration of our third-order results is given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12 (left)</ref>, containing the paths of vortices (green) and separatrices (yellow) with their separating surfaces over time. In a side view (right), many pathlines are shown that rotate around the vortex corelines and are attracted and repelled by the separating surfaces, showing that they indeed act as material boundaries as expected.

The left image depicts the flow in the steady frame, including separating surfaces (red and blue), whereas the right image shows the paths of the feature curves. Note that again the separatrices emanating from different bifurcation lines do not perfectly meet, which is likely to be caused by the dissipation of the vortices, i.e., the unsteadiness of this flow is not only determined by motion, cf. Section 7.5.

The vortex street still forms, but the corelines and bifurcation lines are bent, making the extraction more challenging. While vortex corelines are still captured well, we can see that one bifurcation line is not passing through its saddle critical points in w(x,t). This shows that the extraction is still numerically challenging, which opens opportunities for future research.</p><p>3D Turbulent Rotating Mixer.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.7">Parameter Studies</head><p>Neighborhood Region U. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 14</ref> shows the time partial residual for varying neighborhood sizes U in the CYLINDER 2D flow. In the wake of the obstacle, the residual is the largest and increases with growing U. This aside, the location of critical points is stable everywhere in the domain for all U. Generally, the neighborhood size must be large enough to contain more voxels than unknowns in the linear system. Due to the Taylor expansion, the movement is allowed to be spatially varying inside the neighborhood. Note that, the more degrees of freedom added, the larger the U must be to obtain a full rank system. Continuous Basis Representations. In Section 4.2.2, we decided to describe the spatial variation of the reference frame transformation parameters F t and G within the neighborhood U in monomial basis using a Taylor expansion. We experimented with other basis representations, such as the Chebyshev basis (as an alternative polynomial basis representation) and the Fourier basis. The results and derivation of the linear system for those cases can be found in the additional material, Sect. 6. Note that a zero-order approximation (m = 0) is identical in all cases and that Taylor and Chebyshev have an identical first-order approximation (m = 1). We empirically found that the Taylor representation worked best for us and we thus use it in the paper.</p></div>

The timings and the memory consumption of the SAT are reported in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for varying Taylor approximation orders on all data sets, together with the grid resolutions and the neighborhood sizes used throughout the paper. We measured the timings for the entire space-time volume in 2D and for a single time slice in 3D. For 2D flows, a third-order Taylor approximation (m = 3) is efficient (about 73 seconds for 100 time slices) and the memory consumption for the SAT is around 100-800 MB in our examples. In 3D, we recommend the second-order approximation (m = 2) when using a single SAT for the entire domain.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.9">Discussion</head><p>Lagrangian Coherent Structures. The term Lagrangian coherent structure (LCS) implies that a feature is persistent in time. Several feature definitions have been designed based on this concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. However, they require an integration duration to be set over which the features are calculated. This parameter is not necessarily easy to tune, as we have seen earlier at the bifurcation line extraction via FTLE ridge intersection. A temporal accumulation of a measure over a fixed time window is unaware of the actual existence of the feature. For instance, when a feature disappears mid-way, we cannot pin down at which time the event happened. Using our local method, we can extract space-time paths and their Lagrangian coherence can simply be measured by their length in the time dimension.</p><p>Uniqueness of Solution. Our optimization reduces to a linear least squares minimization, which has a unique minimum. Since our Taylor approximation has several unknowns, we need at least as many sample points in the local neighborhood U to obtain a full-rank system.</p><p>Consistency with Steady Case. When a steady flow is given as input v, our method is equivalent to the well-established streamlinebased topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. This follows from Eq. (24), since for a vanishing time partial v t , the right hand side y of the linear system becomes zero, allowing the trivial solution p = 0. This in turn leads to a zero ambient motion f = 0, and hence our method does not change the input, giving v = w as desired.</p><p>Physical Properties in Reference Frames. We should carefully choose which physical properties we want to observe in a steady reference frame. For some effects, such as vorticity or saddle-like behavior, we want to factor out the ambient motion. The change in volume (i.e., divergence) is a combined effect that depends on the ambient motion and it is likely to be better observed in the original frame. Certainly, we could search for decompositions that preserve divergence, such as objective transformations, but this might be unnecessarily restricting when we are looking for a steady frame.</p><p>Tracking of Parallel Vectors Solutions. Theisel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref> derived a vector field to track parallel vectors solutions. Note that our ambient motion field is not a generalization of this and it should not be. The PV characterization of vortex corelines and bifurcation lines implies certain shape assumptions (first-order implies zero curvature, secondorder implies zero torsion <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>). This might give different solutions and the ambient motion field should not favor any one of them. Instead, we identify motion directions via reference frames. If the shape assumption of the parallel vectors feature is fulfilled, and if the feature is passively advected with the flow, then our ambient motion field will track it.</p><p>Limitations. We used inhomogeneous deformations to describe ambient motion and used a linear optimization to compute them. Since our method is local and applied per time slice, the resulting topological elements are not guaranteed to be temporally coherent, which can be seen in the video. In the future, we would like to investigate strategies to enhance the temporal coherence. A practical concern is that the linear optimization requires good estimates of spatial and temporal derivatives. Especially in the light of large-scale simulations, we think that future simulation codes should write time partials to disk if they store only few time steps. The dependence on good temporal derivative estimations is studied in the additional material (Sect. 8) with another experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION</head><p>We introduced a general reference frame optimization that searches for a spatially-varying displacement field such that a vector field evolving under this displacement transformation becomes steady. This gave rise to a vector field decomposition into a flow in the steady reference frame and the remaining ambient motion. While the steady frame is used to extract elements of the standard steady vector field topology as well as vortex corelines and bifurcation lines, the ambient motion describes the motion of structures over time. We demonstrated that our new reference frame optimization outperforms existing local <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and global <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> optimization methods. In the optimal frame, bifurcation lines are more accurately extracted than with local approximations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and they are independent of the integration duration <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Further, the separatrices in the optimal frame correspond to the streakline-based topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, but can be computed per time slice in the entire domain.</p><p>We believe that our work can spur a wealth of follow-up research, for instance on the identification of Hopf and fold bifurcations, and on many other topological elements that we have not studied yet, including saddle connectors, and recirculations. There has been extensive research on the analysis of higher-order topological structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">53]</ref>. We assume that these methods would carry directly into the optimal reference frame, but this is still subject to further research.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Overview of our unsteady vector field topology extraction.
