<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Traffic jams, unbalanced transportation capacities, and frequently occurring accidents are major problems for the road networks in modern cities. Many of these issues can be attributed to the improper planning, maintenance and traffic control. For example: 1) the density of secondary roads is too low to match that of trunk roads, which is caused by insufficient road network planning; 2) traffic flow are produced by vehicles with a large variety of moving distances and speeds; 3) roads and crossroads have mismatched transportation capacities; 4) the functional division of roads is too ambiguous <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>Conventionally, qualitative and quantitative approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> are employed to assess traffic situations on roads. In qualitative assessment, analysts examine the main factors that influence traffic to judge whether a road meets the design requirements and is adequate for its current traffic flow. On the other hand, some traffic simulation products (e.g., TransCAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, Cube <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and EMME <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>) utilize quantitative IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology 2014 November 9-14, Paris, France 978-1-4799-6227-3/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE empirical models for road network analysis and evaluation. To study traffic situations in a large-scale region, analysts have to manually adjust many parameters in a trial-and-error process.</p><p>Data-driven methods have attracted much attention due to the rapid development of sensor and data transmission techniques. One popular approach is to use GPS-trajectory data collected by cars, which sample road conditions in a very short time interval <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The trajectory data represents real traffic situations, from which the statistics of traffic flow can be extracted and city-wide travel patterns can be discovered <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Researchers can discover city regions with different functions based on human mobility patterns and points of interest (POIs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, detect regions with salient traffic problems to evaluate the effectiveness of road layout by abstracting features from taxi traces <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, and predict future movements of objects using historical trajectories <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. However, few existing work are designed for the analysts to complete their typical tasks which required interactive transport assessment.</p><p>The challenges of interactive assessment are two-fold. First, querying a huge amount of trajectories on arbitrarily chosen roads in a city can be quite time-consuming. Thus, a highly efficient scheme for trajectory data organization and query is needed. Second, discovering and analyzing potential problems on roads should be dynamic, analyst-driven, and situation-aware. Visual feedback and interaction are required in this process. To overcome the challenges, in this paper, we present a visual analysis system for analysts to evaluate real traffic situations based on taxi trajectory data. We propose a road-based query model constructed on TripHash, a new bi-directional linked hash-based trajectory data structure. TripHash is specifically suitable for fast queries and computations in local areas. Moreover, we design a sketch-based dynamic query tool that facilitates interactive and visual study of road situations and vehicle trips. Our system employs multiple coordinated views to support on-demand assessment. In summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows:</p><p>• A dynamic road-based trajectory query model that facilitates on-demand spatio-temporal queries of trajectories without using any textual query language. Furthermore, it supports complex topological queries <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, namely enter, leave, cross and cover of roads.</p><p>• A bi-directional linked hash index scheme over taxi trajectories that enables real-time query and response. One unique feature of this scheme is that free-style queries in narrow and irregular roads are made easy.</p><p>• A visual analysis system that incorporates domain expertise for transport analysis and traffic assessment in a situation-aware way.</p><p>The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces basic concepts of transport assessment and summarizes the related work.</p><p>We describe the problems and analyze requirements of transport assessment in Section 3. In Section 4, we give an overview of data preprocessing and some assumptions. Then a road-based query is described in Section 5 and Section 6. Section 7 presents several case studies using a real dataset. Finally, we conclude our work in Section 8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PRELIMINARIES AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Related Concepts on Transportation Planning</head><p>According to the national standard for transportation planning and design <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, urban roads are classified into four categories.</p><p>• Expressways are designed for long-distance transportation and permit a high speed limit. They connect urban districts with suburban areas with widths of 40-60 meters.</p><p>• Trunk roads connect main districts in urban regions. Their widths are typically 30-60 meters.</p><p>• Secondary roads function as trunk roads in local regions, which are supplementary yet essential parts of the road network. Their widths are typically 20-30 meters.</p><p>• Branch roads connect residential communities and villages to secondary roads. Their widths are typically 12-16 meters.</p><p>For the sake of clarity, we use the term road to describe a street of a road network. A subdivision of a road is called a road segment. For megacities with a population of more than 2 million, the designated speed of the four kinds of road are 80, 60, 40 and 30 kilometers per hour respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>The place where two or more roads intersect is called an intersection. The capacity of an intersection denotes the maximum traffic volume in the crossing traffic flow. Capacity is influenced by several factors: the shape and area of the intersection, the number of lanes, the widths of roads, as well as the traffic control measures. These factors complicate the calculation of the traffic capacity of an intersection. We can make assumptions about certain conditions and do the calculations by means of theoretical reasoning methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Visual Analysis of Trajectory Data</head><p>A variety of techniques and methods adapted from cartography and scientific visualization are studied and applied in trajectory data visualization. Andrienko et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> summarize characteristics of movement data and develop visualization methods for moving objects, spatial events and spatial and temporal distributions. Another example <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> takes time as an independent axis and displays trajectory changes with location and time in 3D space. Trajectories can be convolved to generate Kernel Density Estimations (KDEs) to give an overview at various levels of detail. Willems et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> visualize vessel traffic at two levels of detail to reveal both global patterns, like traffic lanes, and local patterns, such as anchoring zones. Scheepens et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> use density maps to show an aggregated overview of data with multiple attributes. Existing tools provide pleasing visualizations, but few of them filter and highlight relevant location traces on the roads. For instance, Trace-Viz <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> aims to filter trajectories with high similarity scores by computing the proportion of brushed points and traced points. In this work, we design a brushing tool that considers not only the proportion, but also the orders of brush points and trace points.</p><p>Visual analysis of trajectory data generally falls into two categories: macro-pattern analysis and micro-pattern analysis. In macro-pattern analysis, global phenomena, like human behavior, are presented in a large area, such as a city or a district. As for micro-pattern, trajectory data in a local area is studied to discover detailed patterns on a road or an intersection. <ref type="bibr">Song et al. [36]</ref> analyze the Japanese victims' movement behaviors while seeking shelter after the leak of the Fukushima nuclear plant. Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> discover diversity patterns of traffic after investigating trajectory data in circular areas. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> extract complex traffic jam information from global trajectory data and analyze the propagation of traffic jams at specific road segments. Guo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> study micro-patterns and abnormal behaviors of traffic flow at intersections by analyzing a dataset at one intersection. Chu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> develop a methodology to discover and analyze the hidden knowledge of massive taxi trajectory data by transforming the geographic coordinates to street names and applying topic modeling technique. T-Watcher <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> presents traffic status from overview to detail in three views: a region view, a road view, and a vehicle view. In this paper, we adopt a micro-pattern analysis of traffic flow in order to assess the rationality of transportation planning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Query of Trajectory Data</head><p>Previous methods for trajectory data query can be classified into three categories: point query (P-Query), region query (R-Query) and trajectory query (T-Query) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. P-Query locates the trajectories that pass through a specific location. R-Query aims at finding trajectories that pass through certain space or time intervals. T-Query detects trajectories that share similarities with a given set of trajectories. Ferreira et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> provide a visualized query tool that enables trip record queries with space, time and other attributes chosen by users. However, this approach is designed for queries over origin-destination (OD) data in large areas, not for trajectories on roads. Although nanocubes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> can be used to explore spatio-temporal datasets in real-time, it is mainly designed for large region queries. Our approach allows analysts to freely select roads as constraints to query similar trajectories. It is basically an R-Query based method and differs from existing solutions in that it can handle spatial regions consisting of consecutive and irregular areas.</p><p>Native-space indexing is the mainstream method for indexing spatio-temporal data, using approximations such as minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs), octagons and regular grid cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. To query trajectories over a spatial division, a high resolution spatial grid can provide better matches at the expense of more computational resources.</p><p>There are two major indexing methods in accordance with trajectory data structures. Multidimensional index methods, for example, 3D R-Tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, STR-Trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and HR-Tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, extend from R-Tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and construct MBR based on trajectory clustering. Other approaches divide space into grids and build a time index for each grid point, e.g. SETI <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and MTSB-Tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p><p>For large trajectories, systems like SETI and TrajStore <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> leverage segmentation to reduce the size of bounding boxes. Segments that are spatially close will be saved in the same disk partition so as to accelerate the query processing. However, both of them do not provide topology queries and are expensive for searching trajectories on a road segment. The implementation of R2-D2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> gathers points close to each other into the same cell and constructs a hash table within the cell to achieve a fast query of trajectory points in its neighborhood. We extend the indexing method of R2-D2 by adding the topological information of the trajectories and roads into the hash table to enable trajectory queries along connected road intervals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PROBLEM STATEMENT AND TASKS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data Description</head><p>Trajectory data used in our system was recorded by 8,386 taxis equipped with GPS devices in a time span of one month in Feb. 2012. The taxis travel in Hangzhou, a modern city in China with a population of 7 million. The number of GPS records is about 30 million and the total amount of data takes up to 80 GB. The attributes of a vehicle, including velocity, geographical position, availability and time, were sent to the data server by each GPS sensor via a GPRS link every 20 seconds. We form the trajectory of one taxi by tracking its consecutive GPS records. With no passengers onboard, drivers usually drive slowly searching for them, therefore, we exclude these records because they do not exhibit the real traffic status.</p><p>We extract the road network information from OpenStreetMap <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, a free geospatial data service. It contains roads and intersections data. All roads in the data set are defined in vectors. We reconstruct road segments in the road network data, such that two road segments only intersect at their end points.</p><p>We also use the city map and divide the urban area of Hangzhou into a rectangular grid. Each cell of the grid is represented by cell(x, y), where x and y are relative coordinates from the top left.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Traffic Context</head><p>The basic element of our approach is a trip, which denotes the entire route of a taxi travelling with passengers from the source to the destination. In other words, a trip starts when a passenger gets in the taxi and stops when the passenger gets off. We define a trip and related terms as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 1 (Taxi Trip):</head><formula xml:id="formula_0">A trip Γ = (tid, O i , p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p k ),</formula><p>where tid is the identification of the trip, and O i is the ith moving taxi. p j (1 ≤ j ≤ k) is the jth GPS point of Γ, which consists of a geospatial coordinate set, a timestamp, and a state of occupation, i.e. p j = (x, y,t, s). In this work, the state of occupation indicates that passengers are onboard in valid trips. Definition 2 (Flow): Flow is the number of vehicles passing a reference point per unit of time, e.g., the number of vehicles per hour. Definition 3 (Density): Density is defined as the number of vehicles per unit length of a roadway at a timestamp.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Problem Statement</head><p>This work is carried out in collaboration with a transportation assessment expert. He describes four main tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q1: Analysis of road hierarchy</head><p>Even though transportation planning has considered potential traffic growth, traffic flow in a megacity is typically overloaded. An imperfect design of the road hierarchy may lead to an unbalanced ratio of trunk roads to secondary roads, which may cause traffic problems. The national standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> specifies the criteria of density and quantity of lower-tier roads and nodes, but there exist excessive numbers of vehicles in trunk roads in daily life. At locations where heavy traffic jams happen, there may be inadequate roadways that connect different functional regions in a city.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q2: Analysis of overlapping traffic flow</head><p>There are traffic flow in both rapid speed and normal speed over long-distance or short-distance trips. If both traffic flow overlap heavily, traffic jams would happen. Essentially, our approach leverages the location, speed and availability information of taxis recorded by GPS to determine and study road-based attributes of the traffic situations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q3: Analysis of road and intersection traffic capacity</head><p>The transportation capacity refers to the maximum traffic flow obtained on a given roadway, if all available lanes are used. It is usually measured in flow. In study of traffic capacity, the intersections play a major role for two reasons. First, some intersections may divide a road into several parts with quite different traffic capacity because many cars turn into or out of this road at the intersections. Second, if the capacity of an intersection is lower than that of major roads, drivers will suffer from the mismatch of capacity between roads and intersections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q4: Analysis of opposite directions</head><p>Most roads have two directions with strong inner connections, and each direction sometimes has dramatically different traffic flow. During the morning rush hour, traffic lanes, whose directions are from suburbs to downtown, will have a high transportation flow, while the other half is highly unimpeded. An opposite scenario can be found during the evening peak. Once the imbalance is located, traffic control methods, such as tidal lanes, can be engaged to ease the situation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">System Design Constraints</head><p>To tackle these problems, an efficient data analysis system with a dynamic data query scheme is needed. Specific capabilities and their constraints are as follows: T1: Integrate heterogeneous datasets. A set of heterogeneous data is involved in the assessment process including trajectory coordinates, the velocity of a taxi, availability, road networks and spatial grids. A well-designed data model is required to incorporate all these factors to handle the tasks. T2: Build an effective data index. There are a large amount of roads in a big city, as well as a huge amount of trajectories. The evaluation should be performed in real-time and with immediate visual feedback. Therefore, an appropriate data index for the trajectory database is needed. In addition, a visual interface is preferred to reduce analysts' workload in locating, exploring and analyzing the data. T3: Dynamic query on road sections. Trajectories on road sections are the foundation of transportation assessment. With consideration of real life situations, road sections of irregular shapes should be used as query condition. Analysts should be allowed to set the coordinates, shape and width of road sections in an intuitive fashion. T4: Distinguish different traffic flow. On one hand, as in Q4, traffic flow in two directions may be totally different. On the other hand, taxis entering and leaving a road hold different types of traffic flow. We need to identify all of these traffic flow to provide analysts with more detailed information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Work Flow</head><p>Our work consists of three steps: data preprocessing, road-based queries and visual analysis and reasoning. Preprocessing is conducted off-line. We extract trips from raw GPS data and store them in a 2D  hash structure. In the second step, analysts use a sketch-based visual query and a road-based query model to get results in real-time. In the third step, analysts can further make dynamic reasoning of traffic situations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.2</ref> illustrates the pipeline of our system. We explain data preprocessing in Section 4, road-based queries in Section 5, and visual analysis and reasoning in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DATA PREPROCESSING</head><p>The raw GPS recorded data is noisy, incomplete and erroneous.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data Cleaning</head><p>The raw data is cleaned through the following processes:</p><p>• Delete irrelevant data. Some collected points actually mark locations outside the region of interest (e.g. the city).</p><p>• Delete abnormal points. If the distance between two successively time-stamped points is larger than a given threshold, e.g., the implied speed is larger than the highest speed limit (80 km/h), they are regarded as abnormal.</p><p>• Delete points with time intervals longer than 10 minutes. The reason is that 10 minutes is too long to interpolate.</p><p>• Delete GPS points with a state of empty. We only consider those trips containing passengers.</p><p>After cleaning, the raw data is reduced from 80 GB to 38.2 GB. We use a simple out-of-core algorithm to prefetch data from disks and trips recently queried will be loaded into memory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Trip Segmentation</head><p>Trips are created by linking cleaned GPS points. It is typical that the time intervals between two consecutive GPS points fall in a range of 15 to 25 seconds. If there is a larger time interval, a linear interpolation is performed along the matched road to add samples. In practice, the ratio of added samples is less than 2%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Map Matching</head><p>Matching the trajectory data to the road network is essential for query and analysis. There are a number of studies on matching GPS samples on a digital map. These approaches can be generally classified into three classes: local/incremental methods, global methods, and statistical methods. The local/incremental methods try to find local match of geometries. When matching a new position, it only considers a small portion of the trajectory that is close to the position. In this work, we adopt Greenfold's <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> approach to match samples on most parts of the map except intersections, since it works well on a high sampling rate (e.g. 20 seconds/point). When a taxi turns at an intersection, two consecutive sampling points may belong to two roads. Directly connecting them would create a mismatch of the trajectory over the intersecting roads. To address this challenge, we calculate the locations of intersections in the city from the road network data provided by OpenStreetMap. After obtaining the coordinates of intersections, these coordinates are used to interpolate points when a taxi enters an intersection. Such an approach helps create a closely matched trajectory by minimizing the deviation of trip points from roads.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">ROAD-BASED QUERY</head><p>To fulfill the analysis tasks, we design a query model and an efficient index scheme for dynamic querying of trips on road networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Road-based Query Model</head><p>A typical search on sets of taxi trips is based on a given road section and a time period, e.g. finding all trips passing a given road between 6:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. in a week. Our new query model is based on road maps and differs from conventional searches conducted by query languages over spatial and temporal databases. Definitions within the query model, namely road-based query model, are given below. Definition 4 (Region of Query): A region of query, R, is a collection of grid cells on the map, which approximates a road segment. Definition 5 (Topology): A topology mode of trips, ω, describes the relationships between moving objects and roads, such as enter, leave, cover and cross, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.3</ref>.</p><p>The topology mode is an important indicator of the status of road sections. For example, if there are more cars leaving than entering a road in a time period, the traffic pressure of this road is relatively low. Definition 6 (Road-based Query): A road-based query Q(Γ, R, ω, t) performs a search on a given spatial region R (road segment) and a temporal interval t, and returns a corpus Γ consisting of trips, Γ j , that exhibits a topology mode ω during t. Here,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Γ j ⊂ Γ, R × Γ j ∈ ω.</formula><p>The road-based query is different from the conventional R-query for two reasons. First, a region of the road-based query is typically an irregular-shaped road segment that consists of consecutive and small areas. However, the R-query involves a large and regular area, e.g. one city block or more. Second, the road-based query includes four topology modes. In contrast, topology modes are generally neglected in the conventional R-query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Index Scheme</head><p>The general idea of indexing trips is to constrain the trips in the road network. We further design the Trip Grid (T G) as a container which stores recent trips. We use this grid to divide the area of interest into a set of rectangular regions, namely cells, with fixed width. GPS points of trips are projected to the grid. The size of a cell is determined by both the width of roads and the average speed of taxis, and will be explained in Section 6.1.1. We use cell(x, y) to denote a cell at the position (x, y) in the grid.</p><p>When a trip passes a cell(x, y), GPS points located in this cell will be inserted into T G(x i , y i ). We employ a hash table, called TripHash (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig.4</ref>) to facilitate an efficient search of trips over T G. Data stored in the TripHash of each cell is indexed by a key, composed of a moving object ID O i and a timestamp t. It means O i passes this cell at time t. The value of the hash index in the TripHash includes three parts: the GPS point ID pid, the coordinate of this point's previous point in the trip, and the coordinate of its next point. In this way, we store all the moving objects' trips in the TripHash table, and all points of a trip are bi-directionally linked. Knowing a trip ID O i in cell(x, y) at time t also enables us to retrieve the taxi's consecutive segment or previous segment of a trip. This is convenient for querying a fragment of a trip or the holistic trip. To achieve higher performance, we use a B+ tree to index timestamps for temporal query. Example 1. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig.4</ref>, O i starts from cell(3,2) at time t, and then moves to cell(5,4) at time t+1. We insert a record into the TripHash of cell(3, 2) with a key (O i ,t) and a value [pid, NIL, (5,4)]. We set previous pointer as NIL because cell(3,2) is the first cell of this trip. Similarly, we insert the records into cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref>, cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7)</ref>, and cell(7,7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Trip Query</head><p>Here we describe how to retrieve all vehicles in enter, leave, cover and cross topology modes on a road. If O i has a sub-trip Γ j that matches the given road segment R in a time window τ = [t begin ,t end ] and meets a topology mode ω, then O i is contributed to evaluating R. We collect all valuable trips in different topology modes to analyze the traffic flow on a road.</p><p>In addition, there are two schemes for retrieving trips which pass a road segment. The first one returns the GPS points that are in the underlying road, as indicated in Algorithm 1. The second one returns points of the entire trips even though they may be beyond the road, as explained in Algorithm 2. The latter is useful when analysts make comparisons between long-distance trips and short-distance trips (Q2).</p><p>Find Trips In a Road Given a road segment R, a time window τ and a topology ω, Algorithm 1 returns a collection of trips which meet the spatial, temporal and topological conditions. First we need  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(O i , t+1) [pid j+1 , (3,2), (5, 7)</ref>]</p><p>--</p></div>

We conduct both forward and backward traversals to each trip Γ j , until Γ j no longer exists in R. If Γ j meets ω, we add it in the result collection Γ. Then we continue to fetch other trips at cell(x k , y k ) in R.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithm 1: FindTripsInRoad</head><p>Input: , on the selected road segment and mark it. We continue to traverse the trip of O i until the end of time or O i surpasses the road segment. Although the first position of O i is cell(j, k) and the last position is cell(j+3, k), this trip does not meet the topological leave mode, so we have to release this trip. Next, we go to the second cell(j+1, k) and find O i+1 t+2 , because O i t+1 has been marked. We traverse O i+1 in both directions and it returns {O i+1 t , O i+1 t+1 , O i+1 t+2 }. Because O i+1 starts from cell( j + 3, k), one end of the selected segment, and leaves at cell(j+1, k), this trip is regarded as a valid one. If Algorithm 2 is invoked, the entire trip of O i+1 , including O i+1 t+3 , will be returned. Find Entire Trips This algorithm is an extension of Algorithm 1 for calculating the entire distance of a trip exceeding a road segment. We have to find all points of a trip passing R. First, we need to execute Algorithm 1 to find all segments of trips Γ on R. For each trip in Γ, we get its first point and last point. Then, we traverse the entire trip from the tail to the head.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">A road segment R = {(x i , y i ), 0 ≤ i ≤ n},</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithm 2: FindEntireTrips</head><p>Input: TripHash is different from the segmentation-based approach, such as SETI. SETI subdivides trajectories into segments and groups them into a collection of spatial partitions, then runs queries over just the spatial partitions that are most relevant to a given query. However, the spatial partition yields a coarse approximation to the trajectories, hence a significant runtime is incurred in eliminating the false hits (see Section 7.1). TripHash is point-based and approximates trajectories more precisely than SETI. Queries of TripHash are in a local area and only trajectories on roads will be returned during analysis.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">A road segment R = {[x i , y i ], 0 ≤ i ≤ n},</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">VISUAL QUERY OF ROAD-BASED TRAFFIC</head><p>We design a visual interface that supports road-based visual query, trajectory data analysis and data-driven transport assessment. We display traffic flow on each road to accomplish four tasks proposed by the collaborating expert in Section 3.3. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig.1</ref>, the main interface shows the map and the sketch-based query on the left and the statistical charts on the right. We first describe the visual encoding schemes for the interface (Section 6.1). Then we explain how our system supports dynamic queries and detailed road-based traffic analysis (Section 6.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Sketch-based Dynamic Query</head><p>We provide a brushing tool to allow analysts to filter trajectories on a road. We split the map into a grid of the same size as the trajectory segmentation. If a road is brushed, the coordinates of grid cells will be recorded as spatial constraints of a road-based trip query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1">Cell Size</head><p>It is necessary to optimize the cell's size ξ in designing the brushing tool because we want to balance performances of time and space. That is to say, we make cells as small as possible to reduce unnecessary query regions; on the contrary, we want to make cells big adequately to cover the majority of a road in width. The rule is to multiply the taxis' average velocity by half of the sampling time interval of the trips. In our GPS dataset, the average speed of a taxi is about 11m/s, and the sampling time interval is 20 seconds, thus max(ξ ) = (11 × 20) ÷ 2 = 110m.</p><p>On the other side, the maximum width of roads in a city is 60 m. We adopt ξ = 110 ÷ 2 = 55m, for the purpose of covering a road segment with the brushing tool.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2">Query Processing</head><p>Brushing on Roads We design a brushing tool that allows analysts to sketch on roads. When a cell of a road is on the stroke, the brush will be constrained to the road. We set the width of the brush to two times that of cell size. Three possible positions between the roads and the grids are shown below. For the cell labeled No.1 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig.6</ref>, the road covers most of the cell, while only a small part of cell No.2 is covered by the road. Cells will be recorded if the distance between the center of the road (see the dashed blue line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig.6</ref>) and a cell's center is less than 55 × √ 2 ÷ 2 = 38.9 meters. For cell No.3, whether or not it will be stored depends on the orientation of brushing. If the brush turns to the opposite direction of cell No.3, its position is not counted. On the other hand, if the brush stays on the original direction, cell No.3 will be treated as cell No.2. Spatial and Temporal Filter When using the spatial filter, a road segment will be selected and traffic flow on this segment will be highlighted. When a temporal filter is used, traffic flow on the road during a time window will be updated. By using both filters, analysts can locate the spatial and temporal range.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Visual Design</head><p>To analyze transportation situations on roads, it is desirable to show trip attributes, geographical and temporal information. For a selected road, we would like to show the traffic flow in time periods, including vehicle speed and the amount of vehicles with different speeds. It gives an overview of whether a road is in a good situation. Then we need to display the relationship between traveling distance and vehicle speed. In addition, we want to present the density of traffic flow on a road. The density measures the total number of vehicles at different parts of a road. Most roads have two directions with different traffic flows. We would like to compare the flow on both sides in one view.</p><p>Flow Comparative View To illustrate the variation of traffic flow on a road in a given time period and compare the transportation of forward and reverse lanes of the same road segment in different time periods, we implement a flow comparative view by adopting stacked bar chart (see <ref type="figure">Fig.1(a)</ref>). First, we count the number of vehicles in different speed ranges within a time slot and encode each slot as a colored vertical bin. Vehicles in the same time slot are stacked in one bin. The speed ranges are color-encoded from red to green. We further split the bar chart into two parts corresponding to the two directions of traffic flow, which are separated by a horizontal line in the middle. The upper part represents the flow of forward lanes and the lower part represents the flow of the reverse lanes. The size of the time slots defines the temporal granularity which is determined automatically according to the time window (t) being studied. The rules of setting temporal granularity are as follows:</p><p>• the granularity is a week, if t ≥ 14 days;</p><p>• the granularity is a day, if t ≥ 28 hours and t &lt; 14 days;</p><p>• the granularity is an hour, if t ≥ 4 hours and t &lt; 28 hours;</p><p>• else, the granularity is half an hour.</p><p>For task Q4, this view can compare traffic situations on roads with two directions.</p><p>Velocity-and-Distance View We design this view to visualize three important trip attributes, i.e., the distance of trips, the average speed of trips, and the trips in peak hours and off-peak hours. A scatterplot is employed in this view. The horizontal axis represents the distance of trips, and the vertical axis is the average speed of trips (see <ref type="figure">Fig.1(b)</ref>). We further encode trips in-peak hours and off-peak hours with different colors on the scatterplot. To reduce visual clutter, we employ a kernel density estimation (KDE) method. This view is designed to help experts identify different situations of roads. For example, if there are many trip points located at the lower right, the road is in a bad situation as many trips with a long distance suffer from slow speed. It is an essential view demanded by task Q1 and Q2.</p><p>Flow-and-Velocity View In this view, we mainly consider the traffic flow variations in the spatial dimension. We encode the amount of trips, speed and the taxis' positions of a brushed road in a block-based map (see <ref type="figure">Fig.1(c)</ref>). The block-based map spans from left to right corresponding to the direction of the brush over the filtered road. If the brushed road is not in an east-west direction, it will be rotated to an appropriate angle. The angle is set depending on the first point and the last point of a stroke. The width of a block indicates the number of cars (set as 20) passing a location within a time interval. If there are 2 blocks at one position, it means that about 40 taxis passing by. The color represents the average speed of taxis at the place. In this view, we further encode trips of different topology modes with different colors in a line graph below the block map. If one topology mode is selected, the related lines are highlighted in the line graph. This view provides information of traffic flow status at each position of a road, which is essential for the analysis of road and intersection traffic capacity proposed in task Q3.</p><p>Topology View To recognize the characteristics of a road, we represent the ratios of the trips with different topology modes by four different colors and labels (see <ref type="figure">Fig.1(d)</ref>). Each part of this view denotes a mode from left to right, i.e., leave, cover, enter, cross. Its width represents the ratio of trips with this mode among all trips. This view is designed for the study of traffic capacity for task Q3, since the proportions of traffic flow in different topology modes can reflect how an intersection affects connecting roads.</p><p>Flow Density View This view shows the spatial distribution of traffic flow on a city map. Analysts can find locations where jams tend to happen easily based on this view. KDE is used to show the density of traffic flow. The density factorh of a location can be calculated using the formula:h</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">= 1 T ∑ T φ (n)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where T is the given time interval and n is the number of trips passing the location. There are two major advantages of our visual system compared with existing solutions. First, our system is a micro-pattern method and gives detailed views of traffic flow. By using the brushing tool, our system can provide a local view of one road or one part of a road. Statistics are only related to trajectories on the selected road with the improved resolution. Second, our system can be used to analyze a large region in iterative exploration. It supports arbitrary selection of the majority of roads in a city. Interested road segments in any shape can be brushed as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">EXPERIMENTS</head><p>We have conducted our experiments over a large volume of data. In this section, we first present a performance evaluation by comparing our query model with SETI and 3D R-tree. Then we perform three case studies to demonstrate how our method can effectively assist domain experts in performing analysis and seeking traffic problems in Hangzhou, China. The domain expert was trained to use the system before the analysis is performed in the case studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Performance Evaluation</head><p>The experimental platform is an Intel Xeon ES430 2.66 GHz desktop that is configured with 16 GB of main memory and a 3 TB 7200 RPM Seagate disk, running Windows 8. We use the real trip data of 500 taxis in one day with about 0.5 million GPS points. In the experiments, we use two types of road-based queries: a query of long distances and a query of short distances in the same time interval.</p><p>We use two performance metrics. The first is the overall run time. Visual analysis systems often require quick responses to experts' strokes. The second is the memory consumption of an indexing data structure. Since the volume of the trajectory data is large, we cannot load all data into memory. The size of an indexing data is a key factor in prefetching data. We compare TripHash with SETI and 3D R-tree. We implement SETI and 3D R-tree using the open source XXL <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> library for better performance. The size of SETI's cell in the query of long distances is set much larger than that in the query of short distances. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig.7</ref> shows the runtime and the size of indexes for distance of 2 KM and 20 KM. TripHash performs the best of the short distance, both in terms of the size of the index and the run time. It is exhaustive for SETI and 3D R-tree to search in such a small area. Though TripHash calls for more space to cache the index in the long distance query, it provides the quickest query response. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Case 1: Traffic Jams on Expressway Influenced by Other Roads</head><p>Desheng Road is an east-west elevated road in Hangzhou with high normal speed in off-peak hours. The speed of most vehicles in offpeak hours is much higher than in peak hours and the travelling distance in off-peak hours is longer as well (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig.8(c)</ref>). However, when analyzing this expressway, we can find from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig.8(d)</ref> that the speed of vehicles drops significantly at the intersection with S3. In the peak hours, there is a high density area at each direction of S3 through the Flow Density View <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig.8(a)</ref>). At the same time, we see that at 9:00 A.M. and from 5:00 P.M. to 8:00 P.M, traffic jams are more serious <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig.8(b)</ref>). In the Topology View ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig.8(d)</ref>), the cross trips have a higher percentage (71%) than the other modes on this road section. It shows that most vehicles want to leave or enter the expressway and the congestion on the expressway is caused by traffic jams on the intersecting road. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Case 2: Watershed and Mismatching Analysis of an Intersection</head><p>Qingchun Road, one of the most important east-west roads in Hangzhou, runs across the city center and conveys very high traffic flow. One major intersection of Qingchun Road consists of several upward and downward ramps from Zhonghe Elevated Road. We first select Qingchun Road in a west-east direction (see <ref type="figure">Fig.9(a)</ref>), by setting the endpoint of the intersection with Zhonghe Elevated Road. We can see from <ref type="figure">Fig.9(c)</ref> that the cross and leave cars take up a total percentage of 33%, while the enter and cover cars take up 65%. Then we select the road again by setting the endpoint of the selection after intersection with Zhonghe Elevated Road (see <ref type="figure">Fig.9(d)</ref>). The share for cross and leave cars jumps to 70% (see <ref type="figure">Fig.9(f)</ref>). This pattern indicates a large shift in the traffic flow before and after the intersection. A large number of cars turn into the elevated road, leaving the east part of Qingchun Road after the intersection much more unimpeded than the west part before the intersection. We can also find that more taxis run from east to west into the city center than those from west to east in the morning peak hours (see <ref type="figure">Fig.9(b, e)</ref>). In fact, such intersections, or so-called watershed-like intersections, exist in most long roads running across both the downtown and the suburban. The watershed pattern may lead to the improvement of traffic lights with better turning signals and cycle times.</p><p>We also find that there exist two points with a very high density of flow at both the west and east parts of the intersection (see <ref type="figure">Fig.9(d)</ref>  <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. A comparison between the results of two queries shows a lowcapacity watershed-like intersection of a trunk road. The left column is the first query and its results, while the right column is the second query and its results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4">Case Study 3: Using Opposite Directions to Analyze Reversible Lanes</head><p>Tianmushan Road connects a series of important office buildings, malls, hospitals to the residential areas of the Xihu District. There is a very high daily traffic flow of east bound in the morning, and a high west bound traffic flow in the evening rush hour. Meanwhile, the lanes of the opposite direction always have a lower occupation in the corresponding hours. Such roads are considered having a tide-like pattern, which is reflected by an unbalanced distribution above and below the middle horizontal line in Flow Comparative View <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Fig.10(b)</ref>). In contrast, a parallel road next to Tianmushan Road, Shuguang Road ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig.10(d)</ref>), has the similar tide-like patterns, which however shows a much more balanced view in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig.10(e</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We have proposed a visual analysis system designed for interactive transport assessment based on massive taxi trajectory data. To support dynamic querying, we develop a novel road-based query model for users to interactively conduct visual transport assessment tasks on roads. This model is built upon a bi-directional hash structure, namely TripHash, which enables real-time responses to queries over a huge amount of trajectory data. Some well-established visualization techniques are integrated into our system as coordinated views, including Flow Comparative View, Velocity-and-Distance View, Flow-and-Velocity, Topology View, and Flow Density View. We have demonstrated the usefulness of our system with case studies on real data sets.</p><p>The system has been tested in a transport assessment company owned by our collaborators. Comments from experts in this company read: 1) This system provides a qualified, graphically-interactive road assessment method; 2) The assessment of whether a road meets its current requirements calls for fewer analysts and devices; 3) Some interesting phenomena that are unseen before can be detected with the assistance of the system.</p><p>In future work, we will improve the road based query model aimed to overcome its limitations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> We plan to experiment with more flexible widgets for time query specifications, since a flexible time query is very important to transportation analysis. <ref type="formula">2</ref>We will design better interaction tools, such as brushing, to provide enhanced user-friendly interface. <ref type="formula">3</ref>We will integrate more data sources such as POI data and the public transportation data into the assessment system.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>The conceptual framework of our system.</figDesc></figure>

The different transportation capacities of the two roads can be attributed to the implementation of a reversible lane. In Nov.11th, 2008, the city government assigned one of the five lanes of Shuguang Road as the reversible lane used for different directions in corresponding rush hours. Through our visual analytics views ofFig.10(b)and (e), it is confirmed that the use of the reversible lane is successful. This is further justified through the comparative views ofFig.10(c)and (f), which indicate that drivers can run faster and longer on Shuguang Road than on Tianmushan Road.
