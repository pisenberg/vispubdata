			<abstract>
				<p>This paper focuses on the integration of a family of visual analytics techniques for analyzing high-dimensional, multivariate network data that features spatial and temporal information, network connections, and a variety of other categorical and numerical data types. Such data types are commonly encountered in transportation, shipping, and logistics industries. Due to the scale and complexity of the data, it is essential to integrate techniques for data analysis, visualization, and exploration. We present new visual representations, Petal and Thread, to effectively present many-to-many network data including multi-attribute vectors. In addition, we deploy an information-theoretic model for anomaly detection across varying dimensions, displaying highlighted anomalies in a visually consistent manner, as well as supporting a managed process of exploration. Lastly, we evaluate the proposed methodology through data exploration and an empirical study.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The recent trend of increasing size, complexity, and variety in datasets (e.g., spatial, temporal, quantitative, qualitative, network data) makes analysis and decisions from these data more challenging, often called the big data problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. One very challenging type of big data is multivariate network data, especially when there are multivariate values for both nodes and links. For example, transportation, shipping, logistics, commerce, trading, electricity and communication industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref> have many connected operational locations where multiple variables describe each location's operations. With flight delay network data, various multivariate operational aspects are considered simultaneously: types of delay, patterns based on airport location, trends in time, and relationships among the airports. To reduce the analysts' information overload and to enable effective planning, analysis and decision making, an interactive visual exploration and analysis environment is needed as traditional machine learning and big data analytics alone can be insufficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>While various systems and techniques for network visualization have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, few support analyzing both multivariate network data (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>) and map-based spatial network data (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>). There still remains a gap in effective multivariate spatial network data exploration and analysis to efficiently answer challenging questions such as the following: What are the patterns in multivariate variables on a node or among node-node pairs? Are the patterns relevant to specific regions and times? Is there any seasonality in the patterns? Can we verify the patterns on a map? Which network nodes and links could be anomalous?</p><p>In this work, we fill this gap by integrating a family of visual analytics techniques for exploring and analyzing such complex data. We employ multiple linked views <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>), two new multivariate visualization techniques, petals and threads, and an information-theoretic analytical backend engine for aggregatelevel and detail-level network analysis.</p><p>Petals and threads efficiently present a simplified representation of many-to-many networks where multi-attribute vectors represent the size of attributes in different directions. Specifically, petals represent an aggregated summary view of directional data ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>) and threads encode multiple variables of links ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>). An informationtheoretic model provides our analytical engine the ability to highlight anomalies in the data. The anomaly detection can be dynamically configured based on new contextual requirements that usually result from user-generated hypotheses stimulated from visualization and exploration of data. The analytical method provides the visualization with additional warning signals and enables users to prioritize their exploration strategy.</p><p>The contributions of our work in the multivariate spatiotemporal network visualization and analysis domain are 1) designing petals and threads for high-dimensional multivariate network link analysis, 2) evaluating petals and threads with a user study, 3) designing and implementing a visual analytics system using multiple coordinated views, 4) integrating an information-theoretic anomaly detection method in the interactive visualization analysis process, and 5) exploring complex data (e.g., flight delay network) to illustrate the use and potential of our designs in the multiple-coordinated views.</p><p>Our system can be applied to exploration of any multivariate spatiotemporal, network link data generated in transportation, shipping, logistics, commerce, trading, and communication industries (e.g., AT&amp;T communication network data <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and electric power grid data <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>While the research topics in network visualization are as numerous as the visualizations themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, in this work, we consider network visualization techniques and tools that are pertinent to multivariate geospatial network data. For multivariate network visualization research, Wattenberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> has designed Pivot-Graph, a software tool focusing on the relationships between node attributes and connections of multivariate graphs on a grid layout. Ploceus <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> enables multi-dimensional and multi-level networkbased visual analysis on tabular data while Honeycomb <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> focuses on scalability (e.g., millions of connections) using a matrix representation that is also incorporated in our matrix view. Shneiderman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> visualize networks by semantic substrates and Selassie et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> present an edge bundling technique for directed networks.</p><p>For geospatial network visualization, Guo <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> has developed an integrated, interactive visualization framework that visualizes  major flow structures and multivariate relations at the same time. SeeNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> visualizes geospatial network data in a communication industry; however, its visualization focuses on univariate data. In contrast to the previous work, our system allows users to analyze all combinations of spatial, temporal, multivariate, and network characteristics simultaneously. Herman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> surveyed other network visualization techniques beyond our paper's scope. In order to visualize multivariate data, and to display the maximum amount of data relative to the available screen space, a pixelbased visualization was developed by Keim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In the pixelbased visualization, each data attribute is assigned to a pixel, and a predefined color map is used to shade the pixel to represent the range of the data attribute. Thus, the amount of information in the visualization is theoretically limited only by the resolution of the screen. Borgo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> present how the usability of the pixelbased visualization varies across different tasks and block resolutions while Ko et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> demonstrate the effectiveness of pixelbased visualization in the task of analyzing corporate competitive advantages. Unlike the pixel displays, the matrix displays assign fewer nodes on both axes of a matrix, and the relational attributes of two nodes are visualized in a link location where the two nodes meet. Matrix displays have been widely used for network visualization due to their effectiveness in providing an overview of the connections in dense networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. Our system utilizes both pixel and network displays, not only to visualize multivariate data (e.g., airports-airlines), but also to describe the network (e.g., airports-airports). We use the term "link" for matrix displays that corresponds to "a pixel" in the pixel displays. Heatmaps present attributes through different shadings of rectangular tiles in a data matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. We use the heatmap shading approach in the calendar representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> that is incorporated in our system.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">PHL BOS CLT A T L O R D L A X D F W D E N J F K L A S I A H P H X S F O E W R M C O D T W M I A M S P S E A P H L B O S L G A C L T A T L O R D L A X D F W D E N J F K L A S I A H P H X S F O E W R M C O D T W M I A M S P S E A P H L B O S L G A C L T A T L O R D L A X D F W D E N J F K L A S I A H P H X S F O E W R M C O D T W M I A M S P C L T (B) Clock View</formula><p>To help users visually explore multivariate data, many systems have been developed in research and commercial areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> (e.g., Spotfire <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, QlikView <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and Tableau <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>). Common among these systems is that they make extensive use of interactive techniques for brushing, linking, zooming, and filtering to refine the user's queries.</p><p>Of the systems, Tableau <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, which has become popular due to its flexible operation, allows analysts to easily access and effectively analyze their data <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Although multivariate and time-series data analysis is possible in the tool, comparison among multivariate, spatial-temporal, and network-based attributes with geographical components is not well supported by Tableau. In our system, all attributes and characteristics in the data are incorporated and visualized using multiple linked views for simultaneous comparisons. For visualizing multivariate data, Duffy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> use a glyph encoding some 20 variables while Scheepens et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> focus on a method for reducing visual clutter and occlusion among glyphs.</p><p>Lee and Ziang <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> provide an overview of using informationtheoretical measures for anomaly detection, including entropy, conditional entropy, information gain, and information cost. A number of case studies are also provided in the domain of network security. Chandola et al. provided a comprehensive survey on methods for anomaly detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Arackaparambil et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> use information theory to monitor network streams for anomalies in network traffic, and to explore the challenges of providing a scalable implementation using a distributed approach to computing entropy and conditional entropy. Kopylova et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> investigate the use of mutual information in network traffic anomaly detection using Rényi entropy rather than the traditional Shannon entropy measure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">MULTIVARIATE NETWORK VISUALIZATION</head><p>To effectively reveal as many aspects of the data characteristics as possible, we explore the data in a series of linked visualizations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1illustrates</ref> how our system provides comprehensive multivariate network information in multiple linked views. For illustration, we use a flight delay network dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> as an example of multivariate geospatial network data, but any multivariate network data can be populated into our system. Multivariate network information is provided in the geographical view (F) where any operational variable can be used for coloring the node (e.g., anomaly score). The user can explore the data in either a matrix view or a parallel coordinate view (G). Note that (G) has two tab views at the bottom, and a parallel coordinate view example in (G) is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7</ref>. Similarly, time-varying variables (e.g., delays) are presented in different linked visualizations for efficient exploration in the calendar view (A), clock view (B), and line graph view (C). In the bar chart view (L), the user can interactively compare 1) five delays in all petals, 2) five delays in a petal pie wedge, and 3) five delays for an origin-destination pair thread. The height of the bars is normalized and the numeric delay information (longest) is presented in (L). The hourly delay of paths view (J), is designed to allow users to explore attributes in a series of nodes on the paths that a user specifies. With the flight delay data, the user can compare the delays between a direct flight and stop-over flights. As an example, DFW-ORD-IND is shown in (J), where we see that a delay will possibly be maximized if a traveler leaves after 1pm from DFW and between 7pm-9pm from ORD. Users can select airports for analysis in (I) and choose the time in (K). In the system, the line graph view presents temporally aggregated data (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). The parallel coordinate view (discussed later in Section 5.2) can be be used to explore the attributes and their value distributions, as well as designing and selecting Query Conditional ATtributes (QCATs, discussed in Section 4) for anomaly detection. Based on characteristics of the data, perceptually appropriate color maps are chosen from both sequential and qualitative color maps from ColorBrewer <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Spatial Multivariate Network Visualization</head><p>Unfortunately, a barrier exists in analyzing multivariate network data because visual clutter and complexity often occur in visualizing multiple variables for a node with multiple links between nodes in the map. To reduce such clutter and complexity in the analysis, we design threads (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>) and petals (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>) for exploring multivariate link network data. Threads connect an origin to each destination and visualize multiple link variables. Because visual clutter around the origin is often generated by link visualization and our threads, we also design petals to present aggregated and simplified many-to-many network link data. Threads and petals are designed based on the following requirements for the visualization: R1 A visualization should present multiple variables describing the relationships between an origin and multiple destination nodes on the map. Here, users should be able to see an overview of the multivariate relationships and discern at least the largest variable in the visualization for both one-to-one and one-tomany relationships. R2 The visualization should provide simplified one-to-many multivariate spatial networks with minimum visual clutter. Use of node rearrangement techniques (e.g., force-based model algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>) is not allowed to maintain geospatial semantic meanings. R3 Users should be able to discern in the visualization for R2</p><p>which one-to-many network has the largest aggregate value and which variable has the largest contribution for the largest aggregate value of the one-to-many network. R4 Multiple variables describing the statistics for a node should be visually presented. For goal R1, we design threads, and for goals R2-R4 we design petals. In the following sections, we explain their visual representations in detail. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Thread Visual Representation</head><p>We design the thread visualization for representing multiple link variables with a focus on the relationship in an origin-destination pair (R1). Each network link consists of multiple threads, and each thread's width is scaled based on a link variable's value. Therefore, each link has the same number of threads as the number of link variables, but with varying thread widths. While GreenGrid <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> utilizes the force-directed layout <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and presents a (combined) variable on its links, the threads are placed on physical locations and present multiple variables. Users can choose the node variables to be encoded in the thread link width. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref> illustrates an example presenting how link variables can be mapped to threads.</p><p>In this work, we use the departure delay times for each cause of delay as the link variables. This visual representation helps users easily identify which link has the largest delay and which delay type contributes most to the delay. In addition, when a link is specified as an anomalous link, it is located on the top in the stack of threads and other links become transparent so that the anomalous link can be highlighted as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1 (F)</ref>. To show the direction, an origin node is larger than other destination nodes and has a black outline on the node. Note that Bezier curves are utilized for the link visualizations, and threads can be sorted (e.g., departure delays or anomaly scores in our implementation). We incorporate general Bezier curves <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> but we configure the control points of the curves so that long-haul flights tend to be straighter than short-haul curves. In addition, we invert the direction of the normal vectors of the curves alternatively to prevent the case that all control points are moved to one direction in each quadrant. To help user perception, our system provides zooming (with a mouse wheel) and allows users to select the thread base width.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Petal Visualization</head><p>We introduce petals, a new directionally-aggregated radial visual representation as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> (Dallas, TX). In this representation, we can provide aggregated directional multivariate network link visualization with minimal visual clutter because we avoid link crossings <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Moreover, the spatial and multivariate characteristics are preserved and emphasized. Each directional petal (DP) encodes various information between one origin and multiple destinations in a given aggregate direction. Many transportation and logistics problems do have variable variation that is directionally dependent due to transportation paths, weather, routing, etc. By radiating from the origin location to multiple directions (one-to-many), a petal presents the geospatial relationships (R2). The petal length encodes a selected variable value (R2). Additional variable information is then encoded as radial sections within each petal (R3). For example, with the flight delay network data, the average departure delay for the flights heading for airports in a certain radial direction is mapped to the length of the petal. Then, the five types of delays are encoded by length (i.e., a segment on a radius) inside the petal presenting the contributions of each delay type. Thus, we interpret that DP2 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>, has a large NAS (National Aviation System, pointed by an red arrow) delay from Dallas. This indicates a large air traffic delay for the destinations, especially toward the airports in New York. Within a petal, we insert a pie chart visualization to show comprehensive overviews and comparisons among multiple variables in a node (R4). In the system, users can turn the petal display on and off. By default, we assign 12 petals for each origin, but users can change the number of petals, merge two adjacent petals or split one petal into many petals if necessary. To help users easily recognize the destinations included in a petal, our system provides petal coverage guide lines as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>. In addition, when the mouse hovers on a petal, the destinations included in the petal turn red for better recognition. Lastly to ease comparison of petal lengths, equal-radius circles are drawn on all petals. The radius of the circle is the length of the petal where a user's mouse is hovering (e.g., the radius of the current circle in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> is the length of DP2). A tooltip presenting numeric information is provided when a mouse hovers at the center of the petals. This can be used for comparing a variable at one location to a variable at another location. Note that the data for the destinations within a petal's coverage are aggregated and visualized together in the corresponding petal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Network Matrix Displays</head><p>Matrix displays have been adapted in various network visualizations because they are effective in providing an overview and relationships of nodes in a dense network. We utilize the matrix displays in our system to provide more complete multivariate network information, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref> (G). Our system allows up to three matrices, where the y-axis of all matrices are the origins while the x-axis represent destinations. For example, for a flight delay network data for 20 airports, we place the departure delay matrix in (G-1), the dominant delay type matrix (e.g., weather, security) in (G-2), and the anomaly Z-score (or standard score, z = x−µ σ where µ is mean and σ is standard deviation) matrix (G-3) from our information-theoretic model as discussed in Section 4. Note that a Z-score filter is applied so that red links have Z-scores larger than 2 (97.7%) and purple links have Z-scores between 1 and 2 (84.1%). In our implementation, users can optionally make G-3 present additional delay information (e.g., delay by airplane ages and by airlines as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> (c) and (d)). When a mouse hovers on a link, a tooltip pops up to display detailed information including delays of different types, the number of flights, and the anomaly scores, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1 (G-1)</ref>. This interaction method is useful when a user wants to find out whether a delay type presented as a dominant type in (G-2) is indeed dominant among all delay types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Time Series Displays</head><p>In order to present temporal trends, our system provides various time-series views: a calendar view (A), clock view (B), and line graph view (C) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>. With the calendar representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> that applies a calendar metaphor to effectively reveal seasonality and cyclic trends, our system presents the delays by using different shading levels. For instance, the longer delays are presented with darker red. In addition, to help users identify any holiday effect, the week including a holiday has a yellow background. In order to supplement the functionality of the monthly trend line graph, our calendar representation provides additional weekly information on the right side of the calendar (A-1) and day of weekly patterns at the bottom of the calendar (A-2) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>. The clock representation (B) is an efficient tool to detect houly trends <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and we encode variables using areas to enhance visual perception according to Stevens' power law <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The line graph view (C) presents the types of aggregated delays as well as statistics such as the number of total flights, delayed flights, and average delay time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">ANOMALY DETECTION AND HIGHLIGHTING</head><p>The visualizations in our system are able to draw upon an information-theoretic model for anomaly detection in a contextsensitive manner, utilizing the anomaly data for a consistent highlighting strategy shown throughout the visualization pipeline. For example, while <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1 (G-3)</ref> explicitly encodes the anomaly score as the primary visual attribute, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1 (F)</ref> focuses on highly anomalous routes with thin outlines. In this case, attribute a origin = DFW (Dallas) is set as the condition in the model. What defines an 'anomalous' record depends upon the user's design and definition of individual anomaly detectors, QCATs, discussed in detail in this section. From a visual analytical perspective, these QCATs provide an overview of records where important attributes deviate from usual for specific conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Overview of Anomaly Detection Method</head><p>Chandola et al. provided a comprehensive survey on methods for anomaly detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, categorizing them based on the nature of inputs, instance types, algorithmic mechanisms, and forms of outputs. For multivariate network data, we are interested in methods that can:</p><p>• Handle multi-dimensional records -because the main flight data concerned is a structured data stream consisting of 29 attribute dimensions (e.g., ≥ 10); • Address the need for detecting contextual anomalies -which can provide a high-degree of flexibility and accommodating dynamic data and task variations in different detection scenarios; • Facilitate an unsupervised algorithmic mechanism -alleviating the lack of training data in many situations; • Generate anomaly scores as outputs that can be effectively conveyed by most visualization techniques. In general, the family of statistical and information-theoretic methods can address the above-mentioned requirements better than the families of classification-, nearest neighbor-and clusteringbased methods. As information theory is fundamentally built on probabilistic and statistical measures, information-theoretic methods may also be considered as a subset of the family of statistical methods. In this work, we use an information-theoretic method because of advantages as highlighted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. "(1) They can operate in an unsupervised setting. (2) They do not make any assumptions about the underlying statistical distribution for the data."</p></div>

Binning is normally used to facilitate more accurate estimation of the probability of each valid value. In the following discussion, the probability distribution of an attribute, p(a i ), is assumed to be estimated in conjunction with an appropriate binning scheme.</p><p>The attribute set, A, is divided into three mutually-exclusive subsets, A cnd , A von , and A ins . As anomalies are context-sensitive, A cnd defines the context of a type of anomaly as a particular condition, such that all attributes in A cnd are associated with specific values. For example, we may have a 4 = 1(Monday), a 17 = JFK, a 18 = LHR. The attributes in A cnd are referred to as conditional attributes. In some situations, a conditional attribute may also take a range of values, e.g., a 4 = 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 (Monday-Friday).</p><p>The attributes in A von play the primary role in determining an anomaly score for each record that has met the condition defined by A cnd . These attributes are referred to as Variants of Normality (VON). The remaining attributes, which are grouped into A ins , are considered to have "insignificant" influence on the type of anomaly concerned and are therefore excluded in the computation. Such a decision is usually made based on some known factors or logical reasoning by the user.</p><p>A combined configuration of A cnd and A von in relation to the overall attribute set A, subsequently, determines how anomaly scores are estimated for each record. Given a record R, we first retrieve all records that have the same conditional attribute values as R. Let this collection of records be R 1 , R 2 , . . . , R W , where W is usually a very large number. We now consider only the variants of normality defined by A von = {x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x j , . . . , x s }. In conjunction with a binning scheme, each attribute, x j , may take valid values that are mapped to a set of t j bins B j = {b j,1 , b j,2 , . . . , b j,t j }. For the s attributes in A von , there are a total of: t 1 ×t 2 ×. . .×t s different combinations of bins across different attributes. These combinations collectively define an alphabet Z , and each unique combination is a letter z ∈ Z .</p><p>The selection of an appropriate binning scheme for each attribute x j is essential for ensuring that the total number of letters |Z | is smaller than the total number of records W . Ideally, we have |Z | &lt;&lt; W . We can, then, estimate the probability of each letter z ∈ Z based on the collection of records R 1 , R 2 , . . . , R W , resulting in a probability distribution function p(z). For the given record R, we obtain its probability p(R) by mapping it to its corresponding letter in Z . The level of self-information is I(R) = − log 2 (p(R)), which is also called surprisal. We use this surprisal value as the anomaly score for the given record R. The level of uncertainty of this score can be defined as H(Z )/ log 2 (|Z |), where H(Z ) is the entropy of the alphabet Z . It is necessary to emphasize that the anomaly score obtained for R reflects only the type of anomalies encoded by the specific configuration of A cnd and A von . Hence, each configuration is only for queries of a specific type of anomaly in a particular context. We call each configuration a QCAT (Query Conditional ATtributes). It is not difficult to see that a visual analytics system can be equipped with one or more QCATs. For a given record, scores obtained using different QCATs can be aggregated, though it is necessary to understand the semantic implication of combining different QCATs and the difference between different aggregation methods (e.g., mean or max). Section 5.2 discusses the workflow for working with QCATs in a visual analytical system.</p><p>The information-theoretic method for anomaly detection is not an algorithm in a traditional sense. Using this approach, anomalies are defined mathematically based on the probability of events captured by the historical data. So in relation to this definition of anomaly, the probabilistic ranking of events using the method is always correct. On the other hand, machine learning methods mostly use a different definition, where an event is anomalous if it is subjectively annotated as an anomaly. So the goal of a learned algorithm is to mimic human perception of an anomaly. One cannot compare the accuracy of these two methods directly. For qualitative comparison, refer to the survey by Chandola et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, where a few other approaches are considered. The mathematics is not new in this algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref> but to the best of our knowledge, this kind of probabilistic measures have not been used in visualization, or for the flight data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Implementation &amp; Scalability</head><p>We have conducted a series of tests on the scalability of QCATs. Two implementations, client-and server-based, have been developed using PostgreSQL <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The former performs the grouping and aggregation on the client (i.e, in native code), and the latter uses a stored procedure hosted by the database server. Both server-and client-based implementations show that QCATs are linearly scalable in relation to the number of records used in the computation; the server-based implementation is about 2.5 times faster than the client-based implementation. Additionally, the client implementation is more sensitive to the network bandwidth and latency to the database server.</p><p>In our scalability tests, we have found that the performance of the server-based solution can be seriously affected by the number of VONs in A von , while the client-based implementation shows  steady linear scalability in relation to the increasing number of VONs. The largest factor is the amount of shared buffers provided to PostgreSQL. The scalability of entropy computation is linear but does rely on recomputing past data due to updated probability masses. However, Arackaparambil et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> show that a distributed method for conditional entropy computation is feasible, while Guba et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> demonstrate entropy estimation in streaming insert-only datasets. In the following sections, we describe how our system presents multivariate network data and visualizes the detected anomalies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">GEOSPATIAL MULTIVARIATE NETWORK DATA EXPLO-RATION</head><p>As an example, we will use US domestic flight delay data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> where each data row provides information for an individual flight including origin, destination, day of week, day of month, scheduled (departure/arrival) time, and real (departure/arrival) time and type of delay. There are five types of delays. Carrier delay is a problem within the airlines' control including mechanical problems of aircrafts, while NAS delay is caused by the control of the National Aviation System (NAS) including heavy traffic volume. Late Arrival Delay (LAD) is caused by the late arrival of the same aircraft at a previous airport. Security delay includes re-boarding time due to security breach and waiting time at the screening equipment. Weather delay means delay caused by extreme weather conditions at point of departure or arrival. Note that NAS delay and Security delay might be caused by the government organizations, while Carrier delay and LAD are caused by the airlines. We use the top 50 airports according to the number of passenger boardings that encompasses FAA's OEP-35 (Operational Evolution Partnership 35) airports accounting for more than 70% of the entire number of passengers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Flight Delay Network Exploration</head><p>In this section, we explore the flight delay network data from 2006-2007 and summarize delay patterns in terms of temporal (e.g., summer, winter, holidays, weekly, hourly, and day of week) and spatial effects including special conditions such as severe weather (e.g., blizzards). First, we use the calendar view to investigate data patterns. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref>, we can see long delays as prominent seasonal patterns in the summer (B, F) and winter (C, G), while shorter delays were recorded during April-May and September-October. Another visible pattern is that there were fewer delays on Tuesday and Saturday in (J). We find that the patterns are related to holidays that are concentrated in summer and winter (e.g., Independence Day in July, Christmas in December, personal vacations) but long delay patterns are not indicated for Martin Luther King Day in January and Labor Day in September. Moreover, long delay patterns tend to increase in 2007, especially in the summer (B and F). Also, there is a sudden spike (D) shown with the darkest red that might be another point for investigation.</p><p>Next, we can explore the aggregated delays for two years in the matrix view as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5 (a, b)</ref>, where we see some interesting patterns. The most prominent pattern is the series of horizontal and vertical dark red links (long delays) generated at the Chicago O'Hare Airport (ORD) in (a), which indicates that both in-bound (horizontal) and out-bound (vertical) flights were severely congested. We also observe that such delays in ORD were caused mainly by late arrivals of aircraft (horizontal green line) shown in (b). In addition, we notice that there are five distinguishable vertical blue lines in the matrix (b) and four of them (EWR, JFK, LGA, and ORD) were regulated by the High Density Rule (HDR) enacted in 1969 by the FAA due to severe congestion. This may indicate that the rule might not be strong enough to prevent such long delays. The delays in DTW (Detroit) and MSP (Minneapolis), which are two of the biggest hubs of Delta Airlines, are not very long compared to those in other top congested airports. However, it is interesting that the major type of delay is carrier delay (orange) caused by the airline itself.</p><p>Since one of the highest delays is observed in winter as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref>, we use our petal visualization with winter seasonal data for finding patterns and types of delays in the network as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5 (c)</ref>. We can select as many petals as designed for the exploration as long as minimal visual clutter is maintained. One interesting finding is that the flights heading for HNL (Hawaii) from the west coast airports (SEA and LAX) have relatively long delays (e.g., 120 minutes on average) and the prevalent cause for the delay is carrier delay. Moreover, those airports also have relatively long NAS delays for flights heading for north-east destinations (ORD, and airports around New York).</p><p>The next interesting aspect is the delay distribution by time as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1 (B)</ref> in the proportional mode with area encoding for each delay type. Here, we see a trend showing that delays increased from 6 am and had a peak around 6 pm. It is noted that this is the same pattern shown in the late aircraft delay while other types retained their proportion. This suggests that delays propagate during the day, a problem that Mazzeo termed "cascading delays" <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Such trends may imply that delays might be effectively reduced because these delays can be controlled either by the airlines (carrier delay/late arrival delay) with enough of an interval or layover time between two consecutive flight schedules, or by a government agency (e.g., Federal Aviation Administration) with advanced systems for air traffic control. Threads can be a good means for understanding delay patterns, as well as the concentration of delays and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref>: An example of a thread experiment. 40% of the participants answered incorrectly that green was the prevalent delay due to the severe color concentration around the origin.</p><p>complications at hub airports. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1 (F)</ref> presents an example of the complicated network status at DFW, a hub of two major airlines in Threads (April 2012). Here we see that the airport has many connections with airports across the U.S., and the major type of delay is late arrival delay (green) and carrier delay (yellow). In addition, the flights heading for New York City suffer from NAS (National Aviation System) delay.</p><p>Of primary interest are the patterns in the length and types of delays that can be can be better explored by sorting airports. We see that the ranks change with little variation based on seasons, but most delays are caused by major airports including ORD (Chicago), ATL (Atlanta), LGA (New York City), EWR (New York City), DTW (Detroit), LAX (Los Angeles), LAS (Las Vegas), and DFW (Dallas) as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6 (a)</ref>. From the type matrix <ref type="figure">Fig. 6 (b)</ref>, we notice that in many highly-ranked airports, the main type of delay is the late arrival delay in busy travel seasons while the NAS delay is dominant at other times. This implies that the NAS might not be properly adapting to the current increasing traffic in terms of delays. On the other hand, we notice that the two distinguishable airlines causing delays are AA (American Airline) and UA (United Airline) in the two most delayed airports as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6 (c)</ref>. The dominant delay type matrix in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6 (b)</ref> indicates that the airlines are responsible for solving the delay problem because the dominant types of delays were carrier delay and late aircraft arrivals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">QCAT Workflow</head><p>As discussed in Section 4, our system features an informationtheoretic anomaly detection system that is comprised of a set of user-defined QCATs. The design of a QCAT can be based on a specific hypothesis, or as a more general monitoring system for one or more attributes. Ideally, in a deployed system, the roles of QCAT designer and overall analyst would be disparate, with the analyst analyzing the data for anomalies and reporting back to the designer to refine the QCATs based on new trends.</p><p>To assist the user in defining the QCATs in the system, we provide a design tool based on parallel coordinates (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig.  7</ref> (top)) while the user is able to explore the attribute space by adding/removing attribute dimensions, observing their value distributions (e.g., probability mass functions), as well as viewing the record relationship between attributes afforded by a standard parallel coordinates representation. The role of an attribute can be toggled between conditional (green) and VON (black) using the right mouse button. The user is also able to explore an individual attribute in more detail by clicking the left mouse button that expands the attribute to the full view to show its distribution in more detail <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 7 (bottom)</ref>). The detail view also shows the attribute's bin width specification, which can be modified per QCAT. The user's choice of bin width has an effect on the anomaly results and reflects the user's knowledge of the attribute's semantic meaning. The system maps data types to suitable bin width granularities automatically. For example, timestamp datatypes are divided into bins of n  minutes; categorical data such as strings are unbinned. Since integer types may represent categorical, interval or ratio measurements, we assume a default bin width of 1 and let the user decide upon a more suitable width.</p><p>Once the user has defined a QCAT, it can be saved to the QCAT library and selected as the active QCAT. Anomaly-supporting visualizations in our system such as the network matrix view update to reflect the anomaly scores by completing the relevant conditionals in the QCAT (i.e., origin and destination pairs) and executing the QCAT on the data to obtain statistics (i.e., mean, max, variance) on the surprisal values for records matching the conditionals. Our system by default displays the maximum surprisal value as the anomaly value mapped to a visual attribute (i.e, outline on threads) in the visualization. The anomaly values in the visualizations guide the user to identify abnormal flights based on their own criteria specified in the design of each QCAT. Anomalous results can then be explored further using the available visual analytical tools to understand why the anomaly value was high and report these findings to the QCAT's designer.</p><p>For a QCAT consisting of two VONs, we can illustrate the anomaly distribution using a heatmap. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8</ref> shows the anomaly space for flights leaving four different airports for the years 2006 and 2007. The x-axis shows the time of day (morning) divided into two-hour blocks, and the y-axis shows the amount of delay in 20-minute blocks (notice that flights can leave early). Areas of low surprisal value are black and become amber with higher surprisal values. It is clear that for this airport, flights around 4AM are uncommon, and the amount of delay seems to increase steadily throughout the day until late afternoon before leveling out. For the Atlanta airport, three example records, A, B and C are shown of high (≈19.68), slightly above average (≈14.36), and low (≈3.478) surprisal values, respectively. Investigating these flights using threads shows that late aircraft were largely to blame for both A and B; however, in the case of A the high surprisal value indicates that such a large delay is unusual at this time of the morning. At C, we find ourselves in the 'usual' low-anomaly area for this airport, where delays are close to zero for most of the day.</p><p>A professional analyst from an industry-leading company that deals with flight delay data evaluated our system and our approaches used in this work. The analyst mentioned that, at this company, they do not have such visual tools that can enable visual analysis of multiple variables at different locations and different times. Therefore, our system is excellent for dealing with challenging data in the flight delay domain, and it is cutting-edge work for the industry. In particular, the information theory based anomaly detection approach is very intriguing, and it has not been applied to analyses in the industry as of today. Lastly, the analyst suggested visualizations of correlations and propagation of delays (or cascading delay) as key properties of an interconnected network to enhance our system because such visualizations allow for a form of root-cause analysis to help analysts see what is driving delays in the network and what is happening to the delay debt.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Users had difficulty finding the longest delay among distant petals with a small (2%) difference (HP3). The visual aid helped the users better answer with a small difference (HP5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">USER STUDY</head><p>In order to evaluate the petal and thread designs, we performed a user study with 30 participants recruited from various majors at our university. In the study, the participants were given computerbased tasks for verifying hypotheses. Various difference levels in the flight delay network data were used in the tasks. Note that the difference level in this section means the difference between the longest (shortest) and second longest (shortest) delays. Note that the numbers in parentheses in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, and <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> are the results with visual aids. We use a paired t-test to check if our experimental result obtained is significant (p-value &lt; 0.05) within a 95% confidence interval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Petal User Study Results</head><p>We first set up the following hypotheses for the petals visualization as follows:</p><p>HP1 As the difference becomes larger, users will show high accuracy and speed in detecting the longest delay inside a petal, HP2 As the difference becomes larger, users will show high accuracy and speed in finding the shortest (or longest) delay among petals for one operational place (e.g., airport), HP3 Users will show lower accuracy in finding the shortest (or longest) petal among the petals at multiple operational places, HP4 Users will show low accuracy and speed in finding whether an airport is included in a petal as the distance between the petal and the airport becomes longer and as an airport is close to the boundary of the petal, and HP5 Visual aids will improve accuracy and speed.</p><p>TASK1 for verifying HP1 asked the participants to choose the longest delay inside a petal in 2 locations: DP1 (delay difference: 4%) and DP10 (21%), as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 9</ref>. The participants showed higher accuracy and speed as the difference increased ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, pvalue &lt; 0.05). In TASK2, for verifying HP2, the participants were asked to select the shortest petal in 2 locations: DFW (3%) and SLC (12%). For a small difference (3%), 46.7% of the participants answered correctly. As the difference became larger and the visual aid (circle) was provided (HP5), both accuracy and speed were improved ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, p-value &lt; 0.05). TASK3 was the same as TASK2 but multiple petals at Salt Lake City (SLC), San Francisco (SFO), and Philadelphia (PHL) were presented concurrently. Here, the participants showed lower accuracy (from 46.7% to 36.7%) and slower speed (from 6.6s to 10.9s) compared to the results in TASK2. The visual aid (HP5) improved both accuracy and speed in the lower difference ( <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, p-value &lt; 0.05). In order to evaluate if users accurately recognized the coverage of each petal (HP4), TASK4 asked the participants to select airports that were included in DP1 and DP9, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 9</ref>. As summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>, the participants showed low accuracy (23.3% and 60%). The main reason for such low accuracy was that it was hard for them to find whether CVG (Cincinnati) and PIT (Pittsburgh) were included in DP1. In the same context, only 60% of the participants correctly found that SAN was not included in DP9. However, with the visual coverage line (HP5), both the accuracy and speed improved.   <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: The participants made errors and spent more time finding the longest delay when the difference in threads was small (HT1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Thread User Study Results</head><p>Next, we set up hypotheses for the threads. As the difference between the longest and the second longest delays becomes larger, the users will produce better results in HT1) detecting the longest delay inside the threads, and in HT2) choosing the most prevalent delay among all the threads. TASK5 for verifying HT1 asked the participants to select the thickest thread for small (3.1%) and large (28%) difference levels. As summarized in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>, when the difference was small (3.1%), it was hard for the participants to tell the longest delay (66.7% accuracy). On the other hand, when the difference became larger, they answered very accurately and spent less time (p-value &lt; 0.05). TASK6 for verifying HT2 asked the participants to tell the longest delay when all the threads were considered. Here we see a similar result as in TASK5: the larger the difference, the higher the accuracy and the slower the speed <ref type="table">(Table 6</ref>). In TASK6, we had an interesting result showing that special concentration of a color may interfere with accurate visual perception. For example, we can see LAD (green) is concentrated on short-haul routes as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 10</ref>. In this case, 40% of the participants thought that LAD was the longest delay for flights leaving from Atlanta, but in fact the carrier delay was 23% larger than LAD. This error rate is unexpected compared to the result in TASK5 where the participants showed higher accuracy and speed with a similar difference (28.6%). Conversely, we think it is possible that users could assume that the color on long-haul routes has the largest value if the color is concentrated in long-haul threads. To prevent this, our system provides numeric information in the legend view that users can refer to, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref> (E).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">LIMITATIONS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>Petals have a similar appearance to the rose or sunburst diagrams that have been adapted in various contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. The contribution of petals lies in extending the usability of the family of the rose diagram by allowing geographically-directional, multivariate, and aggregated network analysis simultaneously. Discerning widths of thread can be hard when each variable has similar values or when a unit thread within a route is not thick enough for visual perception. In addition, when a color is concentrated on long-haul or short-haul routes, it could be hard to select the largest value among all threads. In these cases, a line with a superimposed histogram can be utilized. To help users with these issues with threads, our system provides interactive bar charts and the numeric variable information in the legend view when a user specifies an area of threads (aggregated) and in a tooltip when the user's mouse hovers over an airport (origin to destination). The tooltip in the matrix view can be used for verifying that the presented dominant delay <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1 (G-2)</ref>) is indeed dominant compared to others. The scalability of threads can be limited by two factors: the number of variables and the links. In our system, the number of links can be adjusted by the on/off function in threads and the provided network matrices can complement the link analysis. Our user study implies that a thread with 30% larger value than the others can be Difference (%) Accuracy (%) Time (s) 11 (Small) 90 5.3 28.6 (Large) 100 2.9 23 (Large) 60 5.1 <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: 40% of the participants answered incorrectly with a large difference (23%) in finding the prevalent delay among all threads. This may indicate that color concentration on long-haul or short-haul threads interferes with visual perception.</p><p>distinguished from the others. However, a fundamental issue when a large number of variables is used becomes how many colors a human can distinguish and which colors should be used. Harrower et al. suggest 12 distinguishable colors <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> but a lower number of colors would be effective for the threads due to the difficulty in comparing widths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We have explored complex multivariate network links with multiple tightly-integrated interactive visualizations. We have introduced two new visual representations, petals and threads, for spatial multivariate link visualization. Our sortable matrix displays have the ability to represent multiple origin and destination pairs, while the linked line graph, calendar, and clock views give opportunities to find temporal characteristics. An information-theoretic anomaly detection model was introduced based on conditional attributes, with the visualizations in the system utilizing the surprisal values for visual highlighting of anomalies in multiple visualization components in a unified manner. It has several benefits compared to previous systems. Our system allows users to investigate the data status of a large number of operational locations by simultaneously observing various data characteristics at both aggregate (entire network) and detailed levels (e.g., origin-destination pairs) using our multiple linked view. Our new visual representations, petals and threads, help users find features of multiple spatial network variables with minimum visual clutter; the network matrices aid in analyzing the entire network in terms of multiple origin-destination pairs as well as origin-attribute pairs. Seasonal and cyclical trends can be efficiently detected in the calendar, line graph, and clock visualizations from our system. Lastly, our system provides an information-theoretic model for detecting anomalies based on conditions. For the evaluation of our system, we presented an example using flight delay network data from the top 50 airports to illustrate the use and potential of our designs and the user study results.</p><p>Our system can be easily applied to analysis with any other multivariate spatiotemporal, network-based data such as transportation and logistics, trading, and communication industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. As a future work, we plan to incorporate the ability to help users find correlations using petals and threads. The capability for visualizing cascading effects and clusters of operational places that have the same characteristics will also be investigated. We also plan to use actual routes to enable comparison with length of flights. In addition, we would like to explore our anomaly detection more by investigating methods of combining the anomaly values for groups of QCATs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>IEEE</head><label></label><figDesc>Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology 2014 November 9-14, Paris, France 978-1-4799-6227-3/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE</figDesc></figure>
