			<abstract>
				<p>We propose R-Map (Reposting Map), a visual analytical approach with a map metaphor to support interactive exploration and analysis of the information reposting process in social media. A single original social media post can cause large cascades of repostings (i.e., retweets) on online networks, involving thousands, even millions of people with different opinions. Such reposting behaviors form the reposting tree, in which a node represents a message and a link represents the reposting relation. In R-Map, the reposting tree structure can be spatialized with highlighted key players and tiled nodes. The important reposting behaviors, the following relations and the semantics relations are represented as rivers, routes and bridges, respectively, in a virtual geographical space. R-Map supports a scalable overview of a large number of information repostings with semantics. Additional interactions on the map are provided to support the investigation of temporal patterns and user behaviors in the information diffusion process. We evaluate the usability and effectiveness of our system with two use cases and a formal user study.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Social media has become an important platform allowing users to publish, acquire and share information. People can not only post messages, but can also reply or repost messages from others, thus accelerating the spread of information on social platforms. Once a message is posted (i.e., the original message), users can repost it with or without comments (i.e., reposting messages). Reposting messages convey a diverse variety of topics and sentiments of social media users. Key players such as opinion leaders may cause a lot of repostings, as they have many followers and are usually more influential. Information spreads via such reposting cascades, meaning that an original message can reach a broader range of social media users, who are not limited to the followers of the user posting the original message. Our work focuses on investigating reposting behaviors in social media. We focus on analyzing the diverse reposting cascades with multiple levels and different semantics.</p><p>Existing works focus on the structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref> or the semantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref> of reposting behaviors. It is challenging to design a visualization that supports an understanding of the multi-level structure and the semantics at the same time. There are three main reasons for this. Firstly, the large extend of users' participation requires a scalable visualization method to understand the structure of diffusion. Secondly, the semantics of the messages vary a great deal in the reposting structure. Different users play different roles in the reposting structure, and how to facilitate an understanding of these diverse semantics in the reposting structure is challenging. Thirdly, reposting behaviors and semantics vary over time, which makes the analysis even more complicated.</p><p>To address the above challenges, we introduce R-Map, an interactive visualization with map symbols that can reveal the reposting pattern of an original message in a spatial context ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>). In this map, key players are visualized as lakes, and users reposting them become counties. Counties with similar topics form a region, while a lake and its surrounding counties form a country, which represents a subtree of the reposting tree. Connected countries form continents, and isolated islands represent messages that are different from the continents in topics. We use multiple connection symbols to represent different relations between key players. A river connecting lakes represents the reposting relations between key players. A route represents a reposting message that was not made by a follower, and a bridge represents a reposting message causing different repostings in semantics. Unlike previous map designs, we address the issue of scalability by transforming a multi-level reposting tree into a map. The map is enriched by the diverse semantic information, which is not addressed in previous work.</p><p>The key contributions in this paper include:</p><p>• A Novel Visual Metaphor Design for Information Reposting. The reposting map provides an overview of the reposting process. It represents multi-faceted information using intuitive visual metaphors to enable users to explore different patterns. • A Visual Analytics System to Explore User Reposting Behaviors in Social Media. Different interactions are provided to help users interact with the map more easily, allowing users to understand the reposting process from different perspectives.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We discuss related work in Section 2 and data in Section 3. We then describe the design of R-Map and the construction method in Section 4, and give an introduction to the system introduction in Section 5. Two cases are presented to justify the usefulness of our method in Section 6. The results of a user study are reported in Section 7. Finally, we conclude with a discussion and directions for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>The state-of-the-art works in social media visualization and visual analytics are summarized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. In this paper, we review related works in the fields of information diffusion, tree visualizations, and map-based visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Analysis of Information Diffusion</head><p>Online social networks play a key role in the diffusion of information. Katz and Lazarsfeld propose the "two-step flow" theory of communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, which asserts that information from the mass media moves to opinion leaders, and then moves to a wider range of audiences. Opinion leaders are influential in the diffusion process and pass on their interpretations in addition to the original messages.</p><p>In addition to modeling the process of information spreading <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, other research studies have been conducted to predict the diffusion of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> and to detect diffusion patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Unlike these works, this paper utilizes visualization techniques to illustrate the diffusion process of information using a map metaphor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Visual Analytics for Information Diffusion</head><p>Many types of visualizations have been proposed to reveal the diffusion patterns in social media. Many of these directly visualize the reposting tree of a message with an improved node-link diagram. Wei-boEvents <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> provides four different layouts (tree, circular, sail, and curve layouts) to help users analyze the diffusion structure of a weibo. Cascade <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> monitors sharing activities on Twitter using a 3D visualization. Users can smoothly change to different views to explore different facets of the information. Chen et al. analyze information diffusion with the geographic facets <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. However, these methods may not scale to large datasets. Revisit <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> displays reposting chains using a focus+context timeline visualization, which hides reposting relations that are out of focus. Google+ Ripples <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> uses a mixture of the node-and-link and circular treemap methods. The goal of R-Map is to provide a scalable visualization method for a large scale reposting tree with multi-faceted information, which is different from previous works.</p><p>Other research studies focus on analyzing the diffusion patterns of collective messages, which often have the same topics. Whisper <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> can be used to monitor the information diffusion on a given topic in real time. Zhao et al. designed FluxFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, an interactive visual analysis system to explore the anomalous spreading of information. E-Map <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> collects weibos and repostings on different stages about an event to analyze the evolution patterns. All of these methods are successful designs in terms of revealing the information diffusion process from different perspectives, but the detailed propagation patterns of a single message are neglected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Tree Visualization</head><p>Over 300 tree visualization methods are collected at treevis.net <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. They are divided into explicit and implicit tree visualizations according to representation methods of parent-child relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Explicit node-link diagrams using straight lines or curves are the most common tree visualization methods. Although they allow users to easily interpret the relations of nodes, node-link diagrams have a rather low space efficiency, which causes clutter when analyzing large scale reposting trees.</p><p>For implicit tree visualizations, treemaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and icicle plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> are two prominent methods. In treemaps, hierarchical relations are represented by nesting the children wthin the parent. Users can easily compare the attributes of the data based on the sizes of nodes, but the treemap imposes high burdens on users in terms of interpreting the tree structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Although various methods have been proposed to help users gain more insights from treemaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>, they are not intuitive to show the information diffusion structures. Icicle plots or sunburst <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> represent the parent/child relations through adjacency: the child nodes are placed adjacent to their parent. To ensure the adjacency of parent and children, nodes vary greatly in size. Although many tree visualizations have been proposed, they focus only on showing the structure of trees. It is hard to create an intuitive way of visualizing the features and relations of nodes in the reposting tree, which is the focus of our paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Map-Based Visualization for Relation Data</head><p>Maps are used to draw the surfaces of a region to represent the distribution of geographical features. Couclelis was among the earliest to investigate the potential of generating visualizations with geographical metaphors <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The advantages of geographical metaphors are the good user experience they offer and the solid theories of geography that underpin them. Skupin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref> also discussed the cartographic research on transferring metaphors to non-geographical visualizations. They mapped conference abstracts onto a term-dominance landscape <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The introduction of GMap <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> accelerated research in this area. GMap transforms graphs into maps to highlight communities and this method has been applied in the analysis of network communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, computer science literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and video content <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. In the area of social media, Gansner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> proposed a dynamic map generation method to analyze evolving topics in realtime Twitter messages. CompactMap <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> uses a spiral-based layout to generate a compact map for comparing cluster sizes of streaming tweets. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> introduced D-Map, a hexagon-based map for analyzing user-centric information diffusion patterns. Later, they proposed D-Map+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and E-Map <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, which allowed users to conduct a multi-faceted analysis of event evolution on social media. However, these methods provide an aggregated view of the diffusion behaviors of multiple source messages and omit the multi-level structure of repostings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">SOCIAL MEDIA DATA</head><p>In this section, we introduce the data and summarize the important features in the reposting process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data Attributes</head><p>The data in this study are taken from Sina Weibo, a social media platform like Twitter that is widely used in China. Each weibo is similar to a tweet on Twitter. We focus on analyzing the reposting process of an original weibo. The following terms are defined to describe the reposting data:</p><p>• Root user is the creator of the original weibo. A cascade of user repostings forms a tree. In this tree, the original weibo is the root node, and all repostings are descendants nodes of the root. Direct repostings of a node are its child nodes.</p><p>The characteristics of the dissemination of a given weibo message can be summarized using the following aspects. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Different Relations</head><p>We investigate three types of relations in our analysis of reposting behaviors: follower-followee relations, key players' reposting relations, and semantic relations. Follower-followee relations. In social media, users' messages are normally reposted by their followers. In contrast, reposting by a nonfollower may disseminate the message to a wider range of audiences, greatly changing the diffusion process. This relation (i.e., reposting but not following) is specially addressed in R-Map.</p><p>Key players' reposting relations. Reposting by key players or opinion leaders, exposes the message to the general public. Thus, we are interested in the reposting chains of key players to understand how a message can reach these key players. The reposting patterns after the key players repost a message are also analyzed in depth.</p><p>Semantic relations. Social media users may express different attitudes in their messages. These messages concern diverse topics involving different communities of social media users. The sentiments expressed in the reposting messages are also important in understanding users' emotions towards the events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">VISUALIZATION DESIGN</head><p>In this section, we first discuss the motivation and design rationales for R-Map. We then present the visual encoding methods and steps in map construction.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Motivation: Semantic Map</head><p>Existing visualization methods fail to provide an intuitive representation of the reposting tree and semantics, so a new visual design is needed to address the challenges of visualizing a reposting tree. Maps describe the physical living spaces of people. Since their emergence, many different types of maps have been created to show different kinds of information. Experts have confirmed that people generally learn to read maps in pre-school <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and need little training in solving mapbased visualization tasks. In our work, we use maps to organize information derived from the reposting tree, and link them with spatial objects such as continents, islands, countries, rivers, etc. The convenience of maps in terms of cognition means that people can better understand reposting data from multiple perspectives. Moreover, the spatialization of information in the map provides opportunities to visualize both the structure and the semantics at the same time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Design Rationale</head><p>Our analysis of reposting trees focuses on the reposting structure, the roles of users, and the evolution of the semantics. We summarize the following requirements to present these key factors and their relations.</p><p>• R1: Providing an overview of the reposting structure. The map should show the overall structure of the reposting tree to help people understand the diffusion process of the original weibo (D1). The map should be easy to understand and should avoid visual clutter. • R2: Identifying users with different roles and behaviors.</p><p>Users play different roles and have different attitudes in the diffusion process. Key players should be differentiated from ordinary users (D2). We need to reveal users' sentiments and opinions of their messages in the diffusion process (D3). • R3: Revealing the dynamic diffusion process. The topics and the sentiments of users may vary at different stages. The messages of key players can create new opinions or topics, and may have a strong influence on the overall event (D4).</p><p>• R4: Coupling the analysis of reposting structure and semantics. The semantics of repostings affect the development of the reposting tree. These should be considered together in the design in order to reduce the analysis burden on users when switching between different contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Map Design and Visual Encoding</head><p>R-Map provides an overview of the structure and the semantics for the diffusion of an original weibo. Reposting features are mapped to different metaphors on the map, including lakes, counties, regions, countries, continents, islands, rivers, routes, and bridges ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>). We choose these metaphors because they are common in a real map and can be linked in a meaningful way to the data features. Lake: In the map, a lake represents a key player in the diffusion process. A lake is the origin of rivers, and thus irrigates the surrounding land, in the same way as a key player disseminates information to users who repost him/her weibos. The root user is placed in the center of the country, and is distinguished from other nodes with an additional stroke. For other key players, they are placed on the boundary to show reposting relations (R1, R2).</p><p>County: A county on the map is a polygon representing a nonkeyplayer weibo node in the reposting tree. A map can be divided into different counties, just as a reposting tree consists of different nodes. Counties with higher influence are highlighted with a black stroke. A county is affiliated with a lake and belongs to a country (R1).</p><p>Region: Counties discussing similar topics form regions. The repostings of a weibo may contain discussions of different topics by social media users. We group these repostings according to topics. Counties with the same topics form continuous regions on the map (R2, R4).</p><p>Country: A country on the map symbolizes a subtree rooted by a key player. All counties associated with the country are reposting nodes on the subtree. The position of a country is determined by a tree layout algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and reveals the overall diffusion structure (R1). A country may have multiple regions.</p><p>Continent and Island: Large connected countries on the map form a continent. Smaller and isolated countries form islands. The connections between different countries represent different reposting relations (R1).</p><p>River, Route and Bridge: These features encode different reposting relations of the key players discussed in Section 3.2. Rivers connect different lakes on the continent, and represent the parent-child relations of key players, thus showing the skeleton of the reposting tree. Reposting often happens in a follower network <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> and indicates an agreement with the message content <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. However, there are always non-follower repostings and semantics-varying repostings in the diffusion process. To highlight these special repostings for key players, we split the territories of key players from the continents in the form of islands. If a key player does not follow his/her parent, a curved route connects them; if the topics of the territories belonging to the key player are different from his/her parent, a straight bridge connects them. Bridges and routes are common in a map and can be easily distinguished. Both a bridge and a route can connect to an island at the same time (R3, R4). Only the different relations among key players are highlighted, as too many links will make the map degrade into a node-link tree with much visual clutter. Users can interactively check the reposting relations of other nodes in the system.</p><p>In the proposed map design, we omit most of the links of the original tree. To compensate for the loss of structural information (i.e., the level of the nodes in the tree), we use color to encode the level information. The reposting levels are mapped to colors with the same hue but with monotonically increasing saturation values <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. A green-scale color scheme is employed to make the map more intuitive and comprehensible. The darker the color of the polygon, the deeper it is within the reposting tree structure (R1). An alternative color scheme is also provided to represent the sentiment of each reposting: red, orange, and blue are used to represent negative, neutral and positive opinions, respectively ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref>). Repostings without comments are considered to be neutral. The sentiment of each reposting is calculated using an on-  line Chinese sentiment analysis tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> (R3). The color coding methods of map metaphors are based on guidance provided by the United States Department of the Interior <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> and the color scheme of Google Maps. Rivers, bridges, and routes are color-coded with blue, gray, and blue, respectively. To denote the boundaries of different countries, we use thick dark lines, and for regional boundaries, we use thinner gray lines to distinguish them from the country boundaries. The white space of the canvas is color-coded with light blue, similar to the color of the ocean.</p><p>To enable a better understanding of the semantics in the diffusion process, keywords are overlapped on the map with color indicating different sentiments (R4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">R-Map Construction</head><p>The construction of R-Map first determines certain key nodes in the tree and then places the remaining nodes, in a similar way to existing graph algorithms such as HDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and Pivot MDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. They are determined by a threshold value based on the number of the descendant nodes (repostings). We set the default threshold T as 5% of the total number of the nodes after testing. Using this setting, if one node is a key node, its parent will also be considered a key node. We can extract a connected subtree from the original reposting tree. The subtree is considered to be the skeleton of the original tree. Similarly, counties with higher influence within each country are nodes with repostings more than 1% of the total number of the nodes. Users can change the threshold interactively in our system. The construction of R-Map includes two steps: skeleton layout and map layout <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1">Skeleton Layout</head><p>In this step, the skeleton layout determines the basic shape of the generated map. The following layout requirements are considered. Firstly, the layout should show the tree structure clearly, and the path from the root to a node should avoid a zigzag shape. Secondly, each key node should be allocated a certain area, so that its descendant nodes can be filled in. We adopt the bubble tree drawing algorithm proposed by Grivet et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The radius (r i ) of the circle for the key node (K i ) is calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">r i := K i .descendants.length,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where K i .descendants contains the descendant nodes of K i , which will be placed in the circular area allocated to K i . The descendant nodes of K i do not include the descendant nodes of K j if K j is a child node of K i . In the original algorithm, circles with a parent-child relation touch externally. However, in our method, to ensure the generation of islands, an extra distance is added between two adjacent circles with non-follower or semantics-varying relation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2c</ref>). The extra distance value d is set as half of r m (the minimal radius value of circles) after tuning. For two key players with a parent-child relation, if the child does not follow the parent, the boundary distance between them is set as d (the follower-followee relation). We calculate the keyword vector for each key player based on its messages and those of its descendants. If the cosine distance between the parent and child is less than 0.5, this indicates they have a different topic distribution. The boundary distance between them is also set as d (semantic relation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.2">Map Layout</head><p>After obtaining the positions of the key players, we calculate the positions of the remaining nodes in the reposting trees. The input is the layout of the skeleton tree, and the output is the position of each node in the original reposting tree. Each node is represented as a polygon on the map.</p><p>Plane Partition: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2b</ref>) Based on the layout of the skeleton tree, the bounding box of the drawing canvas is first calculated. Following this, the plane is divided by a Voronoi Diagram. The Voronoi Diagram generates many polygons, which are used to encode nodes on the reposting tree. The Voronoi Diagram was chosen because it is irregular and similar to a real-world terrain. We randomly project the seed points into the bounding box and apply the Lloyd algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> to generate a relatively uniform size of polygons. The number of seed points (N s ) is calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">N s := W * H/π,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>in which W and H are the width and height of the bounding box size, respectively. We set the area of each polygon as π in Equation 2, so that the number of polygons within a key player circle is almost equal to the number of its descendant nodes.</p><p>Boundary Erosion: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2c</ref>) Although the generated polygons completely occupy the plane, not all of them will be used. Based on the positions of the key players, we carry out splatting of them into the polygons using a Gaussian Kernel. The density value of each polygon in the Voronoi Diagram is calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">D := N k ∑ i=1 α n N (P|μ i , σ i 2 ),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where N k is the number of key players. α is the weight of each key player, which corresponds to the number of descendants. μ is the position of each key player and σ is the radius of the Gaussian Kernel. The splatting radius σ is equal to the radius of the key player circle.</p><p>The density values of all polygons are then normalized. We set the threshold value to 0.1 after tuning. All polygons with a density below the threshold are discarded. In this step, we obtain the basic shape of the map.</p><p>Polygon Assignment: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2d</ref>) After creating the shape of the map, each polygon is assigned to a key player node. We allocate polygons based on a weighted distance function, in a similar way to the Voronoi treemap construction method <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. For each polygon, for which the center position is denoted as p, its distance to a key player node with coordinate K.pos is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">distance(p, r, K.pos) := ||p − K.pos|| − r,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where r is the radius of the key player circle, which is used as a weight in the distance function. Each polygon is assigned to its nearest key player node. The map is divided into different continuous areas after this assignment.</p><p>Polygon Adjustment: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2e)</ref> We have allocated a different number of polygons to each key player. However, the number of allocated polygons is not strictly equal to that of the nodes to be placed. The polygons and nodes of the reposting tree have a one-to-one mapping. The extra polygons for some key players will leave blank areas inside the map, while some key players may have insufficient polygons to place their repostings. We apply a two-round iteration method to adjust the allocation of polygons so that each key player node has a number of polygons equal to the number of descendant nodes. In the first round, if the number of polygons allocated to a key player is insufficient, its territories are expanded by adding polygons along the boundary. Once the allocated polygons are enough, their affiliations will not change. In the second round, key players with extra polygons have these polygons iteratively removed. In this step, we first identify key players with territories that are land-locked by others. The extra polygons are assigned to their neighboring key players. For other key players, the polygons are removed along the boundary, according to their distance from the center of the territory. The polygons furthest away will be removed first. After the two rounds of adjustment, the whole map is divided into continents and islands as designed.</p><p>Node Filling: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2f</ref>) After adjusting the polygons, the lake position representing each key player is first determined. The root node is assigned the nearest polygon to its location. Other key player nodes are assigned the polygon on the boundary which is nearest to the position of its parent polygon. The key player polygon on the boundary serves as a port to the country in which it is located. The descendant nodes of each key player are then placed within each country. For the descendant nodes of each key player, their layout should maintain the reposting relations. Firstly, nodes with the same ancestor are placed within a continuous area. Secondly, nodes should be close to their parents on the plane. In the Voronoi Diagram, a polygon has a limited number of adjacent polygons, meaning that for a node with many children, not all of the child polygons will be adjacent to the parent polygon; they are placed around the parent node, instead. Two layout strategies are considered. In a chronological layout, We first sort nodes on the same level chronologically. Then, when each node has been placed on the map, its child nodes are placed successively. This layout uses a depth-first strategy, so that a subtree can take up a continuous area on the map, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3b</ref>. In this method, the semantics of each node are not considered and no regions appear in the generated map. In the semantic layout, in order to reveal the group behaviors of nodes, nodes with similar keywords are placed together in a region on the map. For each subtree rooted by a child node of the key player, we extract keywords from the messages of nodes and build a weighted vector using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> method. We then apply k-means clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> to group subtrees into different clusters. The cluster number k is determined by the elbow method <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Subtrees without comments in reposting are grouped and placed first, so that users can compare the activeness of commenting behavior for different key players. Other clusters are placed chronologically based on the average reposting time. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, subtrees rooted by A and B are placed together and form a region on the map <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3d)</ref>. Compared with the chronological layout, the semantic layout highlights the diverse distribution of topics in the messages reposting key players.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.3">Boundaries and Links</head><p>After generating the map layout, map metaphors, including boundaries, rivers, routes and bridges, are created to highlight the reposting structures on the map.</p><p>Boundary: Edges owned by two polygons of different countries form the boundaries of countries. Edges owned by two polygons of different regions form the boundaries of regions.</p><p>River: Rivers connect two key players (lakes). Each river travels along the grid points of the polygons and it is the shortest path between the source and target key players.</p><p>Route and Bridge: Routes and bridges connect different lands. A child key player positioned at the coast is connected to the nearest polygon on the coast of the parent key player territory. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows a comparison of the different thresholds that generate different numbers of countries. Lower thresholds generate more countries, which show more details of the reposting structure but take up more space. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">SYSTEM INTERFACE</head><p>The visual analytics system includes a Map View, a Weibo <ref type="table">Table View</ref>, a Word Cloud View, and a Timeline View to support the visual exploration of the reposting diffusion process. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 5</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Map View</head><p>The Map View <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 5b)</ref> provides an overview of the reposting structure and the different topics discussed in the reposting process (R1). Rivers, bridges and routes explicitly indicate the different relations between key players. Each country is further divided into regions representing different topics. Repostings without comments are located around the key players. Important counties are highlighted in each region, and are accompanied by some darker areas, which are their descendant repostings. Users can click the county on the map to investigate the diffusion path and features of the reposter, as shown in the User Information Panel <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 5c</ref>). These features include the delay time (F1) from the original weibo, the relation with the parent node (F2), the numbers of direct repostings (F3) and total repostings (F4), and the numbers of followers (F5) and followees (F6). F1 and F2 help users to compare the behaviors of different reposters, while F3 and F4 indicate the influence of reposters. F5 and F6 help users to understand the reason for the popularity of messages. A prior study by Suh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> proved that the numbers of followers and followees, URLs and hashtags have strong relations with reposting. URLs and hashtags are shown in the text of the message. The border color of the panel indicates the sentiment of this message. Keywords are directly overlapped on each region. This reduces the burden on users to switch between different contexts (R4). A map legend is provided to help users read the map <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 5d</ref>). Users can control the display of the visual elements according to their needs by toggling the radio button. Users can also explore the map by navigation, panning and zooming in the same way as with real-word online maps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Weibo Table View</head><p>The Table View <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 5a</ref>) provides a list of all weibos. Users can sort weibos according to reposting time, number of repostings, or level on the reposting tree (R2). Clicking one message on the table shows the information panel for that reposter on the map. Users can also search weibos using keywords.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Word Cloud View</head><p>The Word Cloud View shows the keyword distribution of the selected weibos. The sentiment of each word is averaged by the sentiment of weibos containing the word. The size of each word denotes the frequency it appears in the selected weibos. Users can select weibos that contain a specific word by clicking the word in this view. The Word Cloud View is dynamically updated to show keywords of new messages when an animation of the diffusion process is played (R3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Timeline View</head><p>The Timeline View <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 5c</ref>) provides a temporal overview of the diffusion process (R3). Above the timeline, a node-link diagram is provided to indicate the reposting relations of the key players, which are sorted according to the reposting time. Below each key player (blue rectangle), all their descendant messages are listed based on the reposting time. The time ticks show the delay time of reposting from that of the original weibo. An animation function is provided to fast-forward the diffusion process. A brush function is also provided for exploring repostings of interest. Repostings on social media often have a long time diffusion process, which results in uneven temporal distribution. Mapping the repostings linearly on the plane according to the reposting time will result in dense overlapping. In this work, we adopt histogram equalization, which is widely used for contrast enhancement in image processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, to equalize the temporal mapping of repostings. The total time of the reposting process is divided into equal-length periods according to the sample time interval. Repostings that fall into the same period form a time block. We assign a continuous interval on the timeline to each time block using histogram equalization. Inside each block, each reposting is mapped linearly based on its reposting time. The original timeline and the equalized timeline are compared in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>, which shows that the latter has much less overlapping.  <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>. Workflow of the R-Map visualization system.</p><p>All these views are highly coordinated to support the exploration of weibo repostings based on the system workflow shown in <ref type="figure">(Figure 7</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">USAGE SCENARIOS</head><p>We present two use cases based on real data from Sina Weibo and demonstrate how our system can reveal the reposting process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Case 1: Influence of Key Players</head><p>In the first case, we use R-Map to illustrate how key players can enlarge the influence of the source message and promote the evolution of topics.</p><p>Map Overview. We can gain an overview of the event from the generated map shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5b</ref>. The original weibo was posted by Little7 (the source lake), and was reposted by Kanchai (twice) and again by the original poster. Little7 was then reposted by Yaochen, creating a large area of territories on the map. Yaochen is a famous Chinese actress and has millions of followers on Sina Weibo. Little7 and Sina also reposted Yaochen's weibo. The key players reposting Little7 did not follow her, and introduced different discussion topics, as indicated by the routes and bridges. The map was generated using the semantic layout. Countries are divided into different regions and different keywords are shown. Most of the keywords are positive, and negative keywords are mostly shown on the territories associated with Kanchai. After fast-forwarding the diffusion process using the Timeline View, we divided the event into three stages <ref type="figure">(Figure 8</ref> -S1, S2, and S3). Dynamic Exploration of the Event Stage (S1) -An Initial Scenario. By brushing the Timeline View, we found that at the first stage <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 8-S1</ref>), Little7 posted the original message expressing her wish to interview the famous actress Yaochen (S1-1). Although she tagged Yaochen with the "@" function, she did not expect that this message would be seen by Yaochen, who receives thousands of weibos every day. A small number of people reposted the message, constructing the terrain around the root node on the map (S1-3). Most of these encouraged her and tagged Yaochen in their repostings, as indicated in the Word Cloud View (S1-4). Little7 then reposted her first weibo, generating a second lake on the map. Clicking this lake shows that this weibo explained her proposal for the interview in more detail, and tagged Yaochen again (S1-2). However, few people responded to this weibo.</p><p>Dynamic Exploration of the Event Stage (S2) -Involvement of the Key Player. The repostings then almost stopped for a period of time. Almost 20 days later, things changed <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 8-S2)</ref>. Yaochen reposted the message from Little7, as shown on the map, which created numerous repostings, generating a big country. We examined Yaochen's information (S2-2) and found that she had over 80 million followers on Sina Weibo. In contrast, she only followed 471 users. Yaochen did not follow Little7, so they are connected by a route on the map. Yaochen's response to Little7 created hot discussions. Keywords such as "applaud", "power" and "sincere" appear in these repostings (S2-1), which are different from those in Little7's repostings, as the bridge between Yaochen and Little7 explicitly indicates. Inside the country, some important counties could be found. For example, a user called Yaxi was amazed at the story, saying "Persistence is the key to success" (S2-3). Another fourteen users reposted her. Little7 responded and expressed her gratitude to Yaochen within a short time (S2-4). A key player called Sina also reposted this news to its audience (S2-5). Little7 and Sina were followers of Yaochen, and the keywords used in their message's repostings were similar. Countries affiliated with them form a continent on the map. The discussions were almost all positive at this stage. Social media users praised Yaochen for her kindness and congratulated Little7 on her success. The whole stage of S2 lasted for only a few hours, but initiated numerous discussions. Compared with S1, S2 demonstrates the great influence of key players on the diffusion of information.  islands on the map (S3-3, S3-4). Both of these islands are connected to Little7 by a route and a bridge, indicating that Kanchai did not follow Little7 and introduced new topics to the original weibo. We checked his weibos, and found that he criticized Little7 for showing a lack of respect to Yaochen. In one island, he pointed out that Little7 did not use modest language in the original message (S3-2); in the other, he stated that the word "appreciate" was not suitable for a young girl to use to an older woman (S3-1). He had over 70,000 followers, and his weibos raised arguments about equality and politeness in interpersonal relationships. By coloring the map with sentiments, we found that negative sentiments dominated counties in these islands.</p><p>In this case, by analyzing a message from an ordinary person, we can show how the original message diffused to a large number of people through reposting by key players, who not only change the temporal patterns of reposting but also introduce different sentiments and topics. Compared with traditional tree visualization methods, R-Map can intuitively reveal semantic features in the reposting process while showing the diffusion tree structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Case 2: Sentiment and Semantics Interpretation</head><p>In the second case, we analyze the reposting process of a hot weibo. The map, which is color-coded by sentiment, gives us a sentiment overview of the reposting process and the opinions of weibo users <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Figure 9</ref>). There are few positive (blue) counties on the map, and most people expressed negative (red) opinions. Three main branches extend out from the center of the map. By investigating the source lake, we found that the root user Caijin with nearly 40 million followers, posted the original weibo that the world's first gene-edited babies were born in China. This message initiated heated discussions and over 9,000 people reposted this message within a short time.</p><p>Zoom in and Explore Detailed Topics on Demand -Continent. We zoomed into the map and found that keywords related to the event such as "human", "ethic", and "gene" had a high frequency. Peo-ple also showed surprise and concern in relation to this experiment <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Figure 9a</ref>). After examining these keywords, related weibos were identified. One person posted "[Surprise] Is it a reality?" ([Surprise] indicates an emotion icon expressing surprise). Another person felt puzzled, saying "How can it pass the ethical check?". In contrast, few repostings had positive sentiments. One user reposted with the comment "This technique may be used for cancer treatment".</p><p>Zoom in and Explore Detailed Topics on Demand -Islands. We navigated to two distant islands from the continent <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Figure 9b, c)</ref>. From the word clouds on both islands, we found that these two islands shared many common keywords, such as "world", "blue" and "clean", which are all rare positive words. Some users' comments are very similar, containing the phrase "For the preservation of our blue and pure world". After further study, we found that this sentence was taken from a comic called "GUNDAM SEED", which tells the story of a war between humans and coordinators, who are genetically modified humans. When people used this sentence in their comments, they were expressing concern and irony about this event.</p><p>Zoom in and Explore Detailed Topics on Demand -Behaviors of Key Players. Further valuable information was found in the lower-left corner of the continent <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Figure 9d</ref>). Following the rivers, we found a key player named DXY (a well-known medical group), with 1.2 million followers. It reposted the original weibo and questioned the ethical checks on this experiment. In the messages reposting it, a user called Ziling, who did not follow DXY, analyzed this event from a professional perspective, and stated that the experiment did not pass ethical checks. DXY then reposted his weibo and reported this fact to its audience. Although they were not followers of each other (connected by a route), they had a heated discussion on this topic, which involved many people. Later, DXY reposted its previous weibo and added more information about this study. The statement that "The ethics of this study were approved by a Putian hospital" caused further discussions with negative sentiments, since Putian has a bad reputation in China.</p><p>In this case, by analyzing weibos about a hot event, we can see that although the topics of repostings varied, they were related to the central event. Repostings relating to similar topics are gathered together on the map. Additionally, user behaviors such as discussions with influential people can make the reposting structure more complex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">EVALUATION</head><p>To evaluate R-Map, we conducted a user study to examine how well users could understand the metaphors of R-Map and exploit the system to analyze the reposting process of an original weibo. We invited 14 participants (nine male and five female) with basic visualization knowledge. After taking part in a 10-minute tutorial, the participants were required to analyze social media data from the case in Section 6.1. We recorded participants' answers and completion time for each task, followed by a questionnaire with seven questions regarding the rationales of metaphor design and the usability of the system.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref> shows the seven tasks and the corresponding level of accuracy. Participants finished all the tasks within 15 minutes on average. The accuracies for T1, T2, and T5 were all 100%, demonstrating the effectiveness of R-Map in revealing the different behaviors of users. For T3 and T4, some users misread the meaning of rivers and bridges, which led to wrong answers. For T6, some participants did not identify the three main diffusion stages because they neglected the nonlinear mapping of the Timeline View. For T7, some participants ignored the reposting time of each key player. They thought Yaochen reposted Little7 after the reposting by Kanchai, so the weibo of Yaochen changed sentiment from negative to positive. Q7: I do not need to switch between different views very often. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 11</ref>. Analysis of the ratings. All questions received an average rating of no less than four, which was very encouraging. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref> shows the scores for seven aspects evaluated by participants. In general, participants were satisfied with the system and could understand the metaphors easily on the map. However, the ratings for Q6 and Q7 were lower than for the others. This may be because the temporal information was not easy to track on the 2D layout compared to a 1D timeline.</p><p>Participants were interviewed about the pros and cons of the system. Most participants felt the map design was intuitive and creative. They also provided reasonable suggestions for improving the system, giving feedback such as "I think the calculation of sentiment could be improved." "I can not obtain the detailed information about the diffusion path effectively" These form good start points for further work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">DISCUSSION</head><p>In the field of visual analytics, semantic map construction is attracting more and more research focus. We address the differences in analysis tasks, visual metaphor, and novelty between R-Map and several recently proposed semantic map series, such as D-Map <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, D-Map+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and E-Map <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. D-Map focuses on ego-centric information diffusion, while D-Map+ and E-Map focus on event analysis. In contrast, R-Map focuses on in-depth diffusion analysis of a single weibo. In terms of visual metaphor, D-Map and D-Map+ use the hexagon map design, while E-Map and R-Map use a natural map form. Compared with E-Map, countries, regions, and counties have different meanings in R-Map. R-Map also uses two unique metaphors, bridges and routes. The construction of R-Map takes into consideration both the reposting structure and the semantics, while previous works do not consider them simultaneously.</p><p>R-Map provides intuitive map metaphors to help in the exploration of reposting data from the perspective of both structure and semantics. Although novel and powerful, the proposed visualization has some limitations. Firstly, the shape of the generated map relies on the extracted key players; when the extracted key players change, the shape of the map will also change. More key players can provide more insight from the overview of the map, but the layout will not be compact, and require more space. We therefore need to find a balance between space efficiency and structure. To compensate for the loss of structural information, a chronological layout is proposed that uses color encoding the level of nodes. We also highlight some important nodes inside each country to guide users to explore the reposting structure of the tree. Secondly, too many visual properties on the map may introduce visual clutter. The metaphors and word cloud used in the map provide sufficient information, but users may feel overwhelmed. We allow users to control the display of the visual elements on the map according to their needs. Thirdly, the sentiment detection method could be improved using the state-of-the-art natural language processing work.</p><p>R-Map is designed to analyze Weibo reposting data, but it can also be applied to other social media data, such as Twitter. A tweet can be retweeted by Twiter users, which is similar to reposting on Weibo. We also envision the further development of R-Map as a general approach that is not limited to social media data. For example, R-Map could be used to visualize a company structure, in which the source lake is the founder of the company, and lakes are heads of different departments. Each department (country) could be divided into different groups (regions), and rivers, routes, and bridges could encode business relationships between different departments. We intend to apply our system to these areas and to evaluate our method in conjunction with domain experts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">CONCLUSION</head><p>We propose a novel visualization method called R-Map that provides an intuitive summary of the information reposting process. We transform the reposting features into different map metaphors and construct a vivid map. The diffusion structure can be visualized using various link metaphors, including rivers, routes and bridges. The distribution of topics and sentiments are also visualized on the map using different regions and colors. We develop a visual analytics system to reveal the diffusion patterns of real-world dataset. We present two cases and a user study to demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of R-Map. In future work, we will extend R-Map to other data and domains.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Visual encodings of R-Map, which is constructed based on a reposting tree.</figDesc></figure>
