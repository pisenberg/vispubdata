<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>A data sequence is a list or stream of data elements, ordered by an attribute, typically a time-stamp or an index. Data sequence analysis plays an important role in different disciplines. As previous work summarized, data comparison is one of the most frequent tasks of temporal analysis using visual techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>. Especially while analyzing multiple data sequences, the following more concrete questions related to data comparison typically arise:</p><p>Q1 tracking the internal comparison: how does a single sequence change over time; Q2 external comparison in a period: how do multiple sequences compare within a period; Q3 tracking the external comparison: how does such comparison change over time. One scenario, as an example, is to evaluate performance of multithreaded software by dynamic analysis. Here, developers may need to track the software execution of single threads to see their behavior (Q1), or to check if multiple threads are assigned fair workload on some points (Q2). Furthermore, developers may also need to know if there is any unexpected unfair workload assigned to threads and when that happens (Q3).</p><p>Previous visualizations face challenges to answer those questions: C1: The variety of data values is large; C2: Large amount of data in sequences needs to be considered for comparison at the same time. In the above example of software performance evaluation, the value variety of data, e.g. method names and resource IDs, can be large (C1). Also, due to the possibly thousands of method calls in a single millisecond, a comparison of thread workload can involve a large number of data records even during a short period of time (C2).</p><p>This paper introduces a visualization technique named STBins to address these challenges. In STBins, data sequences are split into segments by temporal binning. Segments of sequences, instead of sequence data, are visually encoded with key features presented, to avoid complex encoding of large data variety (C1). Meanwhile, instead of letting users recognize sequence similarity through visual inspection, STBins directly renders sequence similarity based on temporal binning to support efficient comparison of a large amount of data in a period and over time (C2). The suitability of several visual designs for sequence tracking and comparison tasks is studied, while usage of a prototype implementation is demonstrated in two case studies based on real-world datasets, one originating from software engineering and another from social media analysis.</p><p>The outline of this paper is as follows. Rest of Section 1 briefly describes the data and introduces the user tasks of STBins. In Section 2, the related work is reviewed. Sections 3 and 4 illustrate the concrete visual and interaction design of STBins. Sections 5 and 6 present results of the perception study and two case studies, respectively. Finally, Section 7 contains the conclusions and discussions on both limitations and future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Data Description</head><p>In this paper, a data sequence is notated as a list of tuples (d i ,t i ), where d i denotes the i th data element in the sequence and has time stamp t i . Furthermore, the elements are ordered by t i in ascending order; in practice, t i may also be an index, for instance, a position on a DNA sequence. For convenience, we just always refer to t i as time stamp. Data element d is typically multivariate. However, in this research we focus on univariate data sequences as many others did <ref type="bibr">[4, 8, 15, 24-26, 31, 36, 40, 41, 47]</ref>. STBins can still be used to visualize multivariate data sequences by visualizing attributes separately. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows a sample data record used in the second case study, where tag information is visualized, with date taken as time stamp. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: An example of data used in the second case study, where data taken is the time stamp t and tag is the data element d.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">User Tasks</head><p>For guiding the design of STBins, we investigated and summarized the user tasks based on a literature review of related work, the authors' experience, and interviews with experts and company employees working on information visualization, software engineering, social media analysis and data science. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> shows the abstracted user tasks according to the research questions, using the Why-How-What typology of visualization tasks introduced by Brehmer and Munzner <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Why? Users should be able to present multiple data sequences, then locate the potential interesting observations by identifying (tracking) and comparing sequences over time (according to Q1, Q2, and Q3), and summarizing the observations. How? Users should be able to encode sequence data, navigate data over time, select their interests of data, and filter out less interesting data. What? The input is sequence data, and the output is the visualization generated. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>This section briefly reviews related work and the problems they fall short of solving. For an overview of the state-of-the-art, survey papers on several topics are relevant: time-oriented data visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>, streaming data visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37]</ref>, visual comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19]</ref>, and strategies for sharpening analytic focus <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>.</p><p>A general idea to visualize a data sequence is to visually encode data values and draw them in temporal order. To enable easy visual comparison, data sequences are typically juxtaposed along the same timeline. For instance, Timeline Trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref> grouped transaction sequences in information hierarchies and visualized them separately, while Sequence Surveyor <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref> presented a similar hierarchical view but with different mappings of position and color. Instead of aligning one data sequence in a single line, Lifeline 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">45]</ref> and EventAction <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref> divided data sequences into sub-sequences on data values and rendered sub-sequences separately. Efficient comparison between sequences can also be achieved through sequence aggregation. For instance, LifeFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref>, EventFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>, and EventPad <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref> chose to aggregate sequences either through horizontal shifting or by fitting to a tree of sequences, wherein both cases similar sequences are vertically closer and their similarity can be observed by looking at their common parts. Non-linear or value-based alignment of sequence data is also applicable. Sequence Bundles <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref> and Sequence Diversity Diagram <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref> chose to plot sequences as stacked lines against the Y-axis of data values. Also, Sequence Synopsis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref> and work proposed by Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref> shifted and aligned sequences based on data value, instead of aligning along a common timeline.</p><p>The above techniques provide powerful analysis of temporal patterns on multiple sequences. However, these techniques are mainly designed for data with limited variety of values and not suitable to solve challenge C1. Due to the limited variety, data elements in those techniques can be directly encoded using color, position, or shape; the task of recognizing similarity/difference between sequences then comes down to visual inspection of these elements, which is less suitable when the number of data elements is large, and hence challenge C2 remains unsolved.</p><p>To circumvent the limitations introduced by large value variety, one can choose to visually encode individual sequences instead of data elements. For instance, previous work, like TextFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>, RoseRiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>, and IdeaFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>, were designed to directly encode sequences based on the river metaphor, where similarity and diversity of sequences are rendered as merging and splitting rivers. Similarly, some of the related work improved the idea of Sankey diagram. For instance, ActiviTree <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>, outflow graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref>, DecisionFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>, Frequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>, and ET 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref> aggregated sequences to joint nodes by similar data values or segments. MatrixWave <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref> kept the core of the Sankey diagram design, but showed zig-zag-linked matrices that represent links between columns in Sankey diagrams. By using these approaches, an overview of multiple sequences can be obtained while keeping reasonable functionality of sequence comparison. However, after several times merging and splitting, it becomes difficult to trace the origin of individual sequences without labels, while labeling everywhere causes clutter (limited on Q1).</p><p>On the other hand, for presenting an intuitive visual summarization of sequence similarity, one can choose to directly encode the degree of this similarity. For instance, work by Beck et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref> and Köthur et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref> directly encoded the similarity between sequences based on distance and correlation measures on every time point. Meanwhile, sequence similarity over time can be observed. However, their visual design is limited to comparison between only two sequences and difficult to be expanded to analysis of three or more sequences (limited on Q2). EvoRiver presented pair-wise similarity between more than two sequences by showing an in-place view through interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref>, but the overview for tracking temporal changes of sequence similarity is absent (limited on Q3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">VISUAL DESIGN</head><p>This section explains the decisions made during the design of STBins. Based on the literature review in Section 2, we made the following two decisions, in advance of the more detailed design, to meet the challenges C1 and C2, respectively: (1) The subjects to be visualized are individual sequences instead of data elements; (2) The degree of sequence similarity is directly rendered.</p><p>In details, we firstly decided to juxtapose sequences along a horizontal timeline (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3a</ref>). As discussed in Section 2, similar sequences are not merged or aggregated like some existing techniques, e.g. EventFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>. This is for establishing sequence traceability without depending on heavy interaction (according to Q1). The major drawback of this design is the limited vertical visual scalability, which is discussed with possible solutions in Section 7.</p><p>The timeline is partly visible, due to limited screen space, but navigable via animation and interaction. Sequences are then segmented by temporal binning (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3b</ref>), so that comparison of sequences during a period is transferred to comparison of segments of sequences in the window of that period. As a result, the horizontal visual scalability of STBins is influenced by number of windows in one screen and window size; both of which are user-adjustable. The former is decided based on user preference and screen size, while the latter is chosen by indicating the time scale, on which a user expects to make useful observations. Usually, window size is selected based on domain knowledge and requirements of the analysis task at hand. However, users may still need to explore different settings of window size if they intend to find insights on different time scales.</p><p>After binning, we decided to present the segments as circles with links between them (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3c</ref>). The greyscale fill color of a circle indicates the count of data elements inside the corresponding segment, the darker the more data elements. The greyscale stroke color of links between adjacent segments indicates the similarity of those segments, the darker the more similar. Finally, absence of upper sequences are filled in by lower sequences (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3d</ref>). There are at least two reasons for doing this: to clearly present a count of sequences in each window and to show a compact view allowing more sequences.</p><p>For implementation we defined several measures. These measures are chosen to fit the data used in our case study, and the choice of measures is open to the user, depending on task demand (e.g. similarity on statistics or semantics) and data scale (e.g. categorical or numerical). The final visual style is not affected by the choice of measures.</p><p>Firstly, to map the count of data elements inside a segment of a sequence to a greyscale value in the range of [0,1], we considered a standard normalization measure, based on minimum and maximum values in the consumed data. However, in case of new data coming in, a greyscale value of existing segments may have to be changed, which will break the view consistency that is intended to be kept by us. Instead, we compute the grey-scale value G(c) of count c as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">G(c) = max(0, min(1, c−θ Θ−θ ))<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where [θ , Θ] is the range of data element counts that users have indicated to be of interest. In our case studies, θ is set to 0, while Θ can be adjusted by users to fit different data and tasks. Secondly, similarity between segments is measured with the weighted Jaccard similarity coefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>. For two segments P and Q, with V the finite set of data values they contain, similarity is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Sim(P, Q) = ∑ v∈V min(c P (v), c Q (v)) ∑ v∈V max(c P (v), c Q (v))<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where c P (v) and c Q (v) are the counts of v in P and Q, respectively. This similarity in the range of [0, 1] is directly used as the greyscale value. Finally, to reduce the difficulty of distinguishing continuous greyscale colors, we uniformly discretize the resulting greyscale values into one of four values {0, 1 3 , 2 3 , 1}:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Discrete(G) = min(1, 4G 3 )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where . denotes the ceiling operator. The next step is to visualize the degree of sequence similarity based on temporal binning (according to Q2). We decided to highlight the windows by white boxes, in which sequence similarity is going to be rendered (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4a</ref>). Within a window, segments from different sequences are linked to show their similarity, again darker means more similar. Thus, light links are expected to be visually filtered out by the white window boxes in the background. By simultaneously presenting sequence similarity in all the windows, an overview of sequence similarity is shown, while temporal variation of this similarity can be observed (according to Q3).</p><p>We researched two ways to visually encode the similarity links (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4b</ref>): either linking segments of sequences with arcs directly, or making an abstract copy (black dots) of those segments to the other side of the box and linking them symmetrically in a bipartite fashion. Dotted lines are used to guide tracking a sequence in the arc design, but not in the bipartite design to avoid clutter.</p><p>Furthermore, the final view varies on different vertical orders of data sequences. Such order can be the same between all the windows (alphabetical order based on sequence name as a global order), so that the vertical position of sequences is relatively stable, while overlap of  links between windows can be avoided. Alternatively, the order can be different for each window (similar sequences are positioned in local orders that are different from each window), which makes comparison between segments easier.</p><p>By considering the arc/bipartite layout of similarity links with the global/local ordering strategy together, we get four different visual designs (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>) and we consider all of them to be potentially useful. Therefore, we conducted a perception study to learn which design fits better to our visual tasks (further illustrated in Section 5).</p><p>In the above design, two decisions are made from our experience. First, sequence similarity is presented in node-link diagrams instead of adjacency matrices/lists, for presenting more data in limited screen space. Second, greyscale is used in two places: fill color of segments and stroke color of links between segments. In this design, the concept of less-more degree is uniformly encoded by greyscale (see legends in both <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3c</ref> and 4b), while the feature described by greyscale can still be recognized by looking at the concrete visual element (count of data elements w.r.t. circles and similarity w.r.t. links). We made this decision through an exploration of alternative encoding that is typically used. By using size (radius of circles, length of bars, etc.) to encode count of data elements inside segments, we found it difficult to recognize visual elements representing very small values; multi-color encoding, comparing to greyscale or other two-color encodings, is less intuitive for presenting the gradient of values; opacity encoding of links can be misleading because of color accumulation caused by overlapped links.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">INTERACTION DESIGN</head><p>Since STBins is designed to visualize data on sequence level, interactions and additional views are needed for exploring data details. Based on the How part of user tasks in Section 1.2, we implemented the following interactions and the additional view to be used in our case studies.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 1b</ref> at the beginning of this paper, the control panel contains functions of loading data, indicating sequence index, and the variable to visualize. The main view is adjusted by setting window size (in nanoseconds), number of windows presented within one screen, parameter Θ of Equation 1, and the visual design (arc/bipartite, local/global). Also, time flow animation is controlled by starting/pausing, specifying animation speed, and jumping to a specific window.</p><p>While hovering over a segment of a sequence in the main view (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref>), meta information of this segment is shown at the bottom of the screen, including sequence index, count of data elements and number of different values inside. In the same window, segments that are similar to the hovered one are highlighted in red.</p><p>Data selection and filtering are assisted by the additional data view (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7)</ref>. Segments of sequences can be selected by clicking. After selecting a segment, the top-ten values in that segment (a summarization  of all the values inside) are shown by two bar charts in the data view. Ranking of value is decided based on two factors: how often a value appears in selected segments (Frequency) and how many segments contain that value (Occupation). These factors are normalized to the range [0, 1] and summed together for ranking.</p><p>By further selecting values in the data view (see <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>), segments that contain none of the selected values are filtered out (in light grey). In remaining segments, the greyscale fill color represents the ratio of the number of selected values inside to the total number of data elements inside. Again, darker fill color indicates a higher ratio.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">PERCEPTION STUDY</head><p>Existing studies show how arcs and straight lines differ for graph reading <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">46]</ref>, but not specifically for sequence tracking and comparison as in our research. Hence, for testing which visual design (bipartiteglobal, bipartite-local, arc-global, or arc-local) leads to a better user performance in our case, the following perception study is conducted: participants were trained to perform two tasks (with regard to tracking and comparison, respectively) on each design; the time spent and accuracy of their answers were recorded and then evaluated through one-way ANOVA <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> and Tukey HSD tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Experimental Setup</head><p>The experiment includes three steps: training, validation, and real testing. The training and validation steps are designed to eliminate the disturbance of participants' misunderstanding during the real tests. Firstly, participants were trained for reading the views and performing tasks. Then, for validating their understanding of the experiment, participants were required to work on a sample test and explain their <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>: Segments containing the selected values are highlighted by a red border. Their greyscale fill color shows the ratio of the number of selected values inside to the total number of data elements inside, the darker the higher. answers. Participants were encouraged to ask questions during training and validation, but not during real tests. The training and validation steps take each about 10 minutes.</p><p>Once it was confirmed that the participants fully understand the whole setting, they were given the real tests on four views corresponding to the four designs. All the training, validation and testing were performed on paper questionnaires, instead of on a screen, for eliminating disturbance of interactions and animations, which are considered to also influence the performance of participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>. Questionnaires used during the experiment are available as supplemental material.</p><p>With the questionnaires, participants were required to perform the following two tasks on each view (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 9</ref>):</p><p>Task1 tracking: given a segment of sequence (transparent red circle), highlight all the other segments that belong to the same sequence as the given segment, as quickly as possible;</p><p>Task2 comparison: for each of 3 given segments (transparent green circles), highlight the most similar segment in the same window, as quickly as possible. Time recording started when the host announced "Start" and ended when the participants reported "Complete". Note that three segments of a sequence were given in Task2 compared to one in Task1 for two reasons. First, to balance the number of segments that need to be highlighted in the two tasks: In Task1 there are at least 3 segments in each correct answer. Second, if only one segment would be given for Task2, the accuracy of an answer will be binary and user performance will not be well described.</p><p>To eliminate the effect of different permutations (appearing orders) of the four views, we chose Balanced Incomplete Latin Square (BILS) as the counter-balanced scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>. Because, first, as an incomplete counterbalancing measure, BILS generates far fewer permutations than complete counterbalancing measures. It means that with the same number of participants, BILS allows more participants for each permutation than complete counterbalancing measures. Second, unlike many standard repeated measures like Latin Square, BILS eliminates the carry-over effect by ensuring every single view follows every other view once. In our case, given the indices of the four views (1, 2, 3 and 4), there are totally four permutations generated by BILS: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(1, 2, 4, 3)</ref>, (2, 3, 1, 4), (3, 4, 2, 1), and (4, 1, 3, 2).</p><p>We had totally 24 participants (6 for each permutation). All the participants are volunteers. None of them has color blindness or any other abnormal vision problem. To avoid inexperience of graph reading, we also confirmed that they all have reasonable educational background, which is defined as holding a master or higher degree in computer science or related disciplines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Result Analysis</head><p>Performance of the participants is evaluated by their time spent (the shorter the better) and the accuracy of their answer (the higher the better). Note that the time recorded for Task2 is the summation of time spent on all the three given segments. We choose F 1 score as the accuracy measure instead of the general accuracy, since it is not  We recorded the time spent and counted #TruePositive, #FalsePositive, and #FalseNegative for both Task1 and Task2. Hence, there are totally 4 groups of results, as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 10</ref> and 11 show: F 1 score and time spent for either Task1 and Task2. In each group, the purple histogram on the left shows the analyzing result of all the four designs together, followed by four orange histograms for each design. Mean and variance of each design is calculated for comparison.</p><p>Most of the results of F 1 score fall in the range of [0.9, 1.0], in both Task1 and Task2. Looking at each design separately, all of them seem to be promising without significant difference. On the other hand, histograms show a relatively obvious difference on time spent between designs, where arc-global is shown to perform better on Task1 and arc-local better on Task2.</p><p>For testing the significance of the above analysis, we performed both one-way ANOVA tests and Tukey HSD tests and summarized the comparison of designs in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. Here, A &gt; B means A performs significantly better than B, while {A, B} means there is no significant performance difference between A and B. For all the groups, arc-global performs significantly better on accuracy but not on time spent (relatively bad on Task2). On the other hand, arc-local shows the best performance on time spent but not on accuracy. By conclusion, we suggest arc-global when accuracy of tracking/comparison is the primary requirement. Differently, arc-local is suggested for tasks that require quick scanning of data with reasonable accuracy (e.g. visual scanning rapidly updated streaming data). In our case studies, arc-global is used. The full analyzing and significant testing result is attached as a supplemental material for further reference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CASE STUDY</head><p>For demonstrating the usage of our technique, we conduct two case studies, where the first case focuses on a performance bottleneck in a multi-thread algorithm, and the second one on emerging event detection in online social media data. In both cases, we invited a domain expert to perform data analysis using STBins and to evaluate findings based on domain knowledge. The users were trained beforehand in approximately 10 minutes to use STBins. The corresponding datasets have different characteristics. The first case has few, but long data sequences, while the second has many, but relatively short sequences. However, both datasets have the two challenging characteristics: (1) the variety of data values is large and (2) a large amount of data in each sequence is considered in one comparison.</p><p>The prototype used in the case studies was developed to be clientserver based. Both the front-end application and the local server are coded in JavaScript using libraries including, D3.js, JQuery-UI, and node.js. Data is preprocessed and stored beforehand in a SQLite database on the local server. Once the front-end application sends a request of data to the local server, the requested data will be fed to the front-end application window by window. All the experiments are performed with a MacBook Air Early 2015 (2.2 GHz Intel Core i7, 8GB DDR3 Memory) and a DELL U2412M monitor with resolution of 1920 × 1200.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Case I: Analyzing Tracing Data of a High Performance Multi-Thread SCC Decomposition Algorithm for Performance Evaluation</head><p>In this case study, we focus on a multi-thread Strongly Connected Component (SCC) decomposition algorithm that is based on communicating depth-first search instances <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref>. An SCC is a maximal subgraph of a directed graph, such that there is a path between every two states. The algorithm exhibits a big performance improvement when multiple threads are used for computation. However, in some instances and for a specific number of threads, the time to perform an SCC decomposition may vary greatly. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> shows execution times for multiple runs of the algorithm. The algorithm used 1, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">32,</ref><ref type="bibr">48</ref>, and 64 threads for computation, and 25 execution times were recorded. The graph itself consists of 1,948,617 states and 3,621,672 transitions, with all states belonging to a single SCC. We can observe (from the symbols) that execution times vary greatly for some cases, especially for the 8-threaded experiments whose average execution time is even longer than that for the 4-threaded instances.</p><p>In an ideal case, the state-space is divided perfectly across the threads with minimal overlap. If two threads are working on the same collection of states, we argue that the performance is suboptimal. It effectively causes the two threads to behave as if they were a single thread, thereby hampering scalability. Therefore, we initially came up with a reasonable hypothesis that the bottleneck may be caused by this suboptimal performance of the algorithm. For testing this hypothesis and better understanding the performance differences between fast and slow runs, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref>: Execution times of the algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref>. and show individual execution times for instances without and with logging active. The red and blue lines denote the corresponding means.</p><p>we intend to apply STBins to visualize the execution log that keeps track of visited states of threads. See the example shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  13</ref>, the red box highlights a single thread and the blue box highlights the similarity between four threads within a temporal window. If two threads are visualized to be similar, there must be an overlap between the state collections processed by the two threads, meaning a suboptimal performance of threads is detected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1">Logging information</head><p>When logging information from the algorithm there is a trade-off between the granularity of the logged information and the impact on performance. When we log in too much detail, it becomes unclear whether the performance differences originate from the algorithm itself or the logging process. The best middle-ground we found was to track only the event timestamp (in nanosecond), thread ID, and the ID has value of the visited state. The performance impact is visible in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  12</ref> in blue triangles, which shows a similar performance dip as in the "standard" case.</p><p>We mainly present our analysis of the 8-threaded case as an example, while similar behavior is also observed for cases of higher thread counts. In total, 17,095,188 events are recorded for 8 threads during 5 minutes' execution. We use the logged information to build a sequence for each thread, where the data element is the visited state ID, ordered by time stamps. The variety of data values is really huge in this case, due to the large state space of the graph (C1). The window size is chosen by the domain expert to be 10 milliseconds. This results in 60% of all the segments containing more than 1,000 state IDs (maximum of 99,563 IDs). Thus, a large number of data will be considered while comparing sequences within one window (C2). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 13</ref>: One thread (red box) and similarity between four threads within a temporal window (blue box).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2">Analysis and Results</head><p>Through comparison of threads in temporal windows (Q2) and tracking of thread similarity (Q3), our domain expert observed four types of thread behavior (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 14)</ref>: a) At the start of the algorithm, every thread is started from the initial state. This results in overlap during the first few iterations (similarity between multiple threads). This overlap of states is considered to be normal. b) After a couple of windows, the threads work on mostly disjoint parts of the state space (similar threads rarely observed) and work on more states per segment (darker color of segments than in the starting stage). c) Suboptimal behavior appears, where multiple threads work on mostly the same states. This behavior is mostly present in the slow executions, but also occurs sometimes in the fast ones.  By observing multiple executions, we found that behavior (c) lasts for a shorter time (basically about 100 milliseconds) than behavior (d) in general. It seems that behavior (d) has a larger impact on the overall computation time. However, from the angle of analysis, it is really challenging to detect behavior (c), the suboptimal behavior, using conventional methods, while behavior (d) can still be detected by manually analyzing the log file.</p><p>Tracking of threads in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 14c (Q1)</ref> shows that a single thread has practically no overlap with itself in a future window (no similar neighbor segments along the same thread). This is quite different from the behavior in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 14b</ref>, and it gives us a hint of the reason behind the suboptimal behavior, multiple threads are working on states in a cycle. For example, assume that thread a and b work on distinct parts of the same cycle. Then it is possible that the remaining states to be processed by a and b overlap at a certain point and causes the suboptimal behavior. Also, since a and b will keep working on mostly the same part of the cycle that is different between windows, there will be no overlap of workload on a or b itself. Our finding is confirmed by reading the original log file and locating states where multiple threads worked on within the same window.</p><p>In conclusion, we were able to quickly locate two potential causes for the bottleneck in the algorithm by using STBins. The presumably most significant bottleneck occurs at the end of the execution. Here, a single thread is not convinced that the algorithm is done, while the other threads are. We also found that multiple threads are occasionally working on the same states for some time, which we analyzed in more detail. With domain-knowledge, we were able to locate the origin of this bottleneck for proposing possible solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Case II: Analyzing Meta Information of Photos on Flickr for Emerging Event Detection</head><p>In this case study, we apply STBins to a social media dataset published on the MediaEval benchmarking activity of multimedia evaluation in 2012 [1]. The challenge is about detecting emerging events in three categories (technical events, soccer events, and Indignados movement events) from a collection of photos with event-related metadata on Flickr, a photo sharing platform and social network for users to upload photos for others to see. Instead of classifying photos <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> or performing semantic analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref> like existing work, we intend to detect emerging events differently. Referring to topic attractiveness in topic detection and tracking, users' active behavior on a topic could be a signal of the topic to be emerging <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>. Based on this idea, we propose to similarly detect emerging events by visualizing behavior of Flickr users involved in the dataset. Since there is no retweeting information included in this Flickr dataset, it is not suitable to directly use the same criteria of evaluating topic attractiveness as previous work on Twitter data <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>. Therefore, we similarly defined event attractiveness as the capability of an event to attract users and keep users active during a period. Hence, an event is considered to be emerging, if its attractiveness is high, which means a large number of users are attracted, or users involved are active for a considerable long time. Based on this definition, we defined the following criteria. A potential emerging event is detected, if any of the following signals was observed:</p><p>More than n (=10) users appear concurrently within one hour, where at least γ (=50%) of them are considered to be similar (highlighted by the blue box in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 15</ref> as an example).  At least one user performs similarly during at least h (=5) hours (highlighted by the red box in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 15</ref> as an example). Here, values of n, γ, and h were dedicated in advance to suit to our case. Behavior similarity between users in a period is measured as the similarity between photo collections uploaded by the users during that period. The signals are expected to be observed through tracking of single users (Q1), periodical comparison of users' behavior (Q2), and tracking of user similarity over time (Q3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1">The Flickr Dataset</head><p>The dataset includes two major parts, a collection of 167,332 photos contributed by 4,422 unique Flickr users, and the corresponding metadata of these photos. For each photo, metadata includes the photo ID, user ID, date and time the photo was taken and uploaded, title, tags, and the URL for downloading the photo. Photos are collected within three years, from the beginning of 2009 to the end of 2011. Events can overlap in time, while noise data irrelevant to any event exists as well. Geotags were removed from 80% of the collection for simulating the frequent lack of geotags in photo collections on the Internet. Also, there is a ground truth of true events manually detected for evaluation. True events are categorized and each followed by a list of photo IDs. More detail of the dataset can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>.</p><p>As mentioned above, behavior similarity between users in a period is measured as similarity between the photo collections uploaded by the users during that period, which is further measured as similarity between the tag collections. Hence, we build a sequence for each user, where tag is the data element, ordered by photos' timestamp (date taken refer to <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Since tags can be any term in vocabularies of English, German, Italian and Spanish, the variety of data values in this case is huge (C1). Window size is set to be one hour by our domain expert. As a result, 137 tags (out of 51,611 unique tags) on average are contained in each segment, with the maximum of 307 tags. Hence, a relatively large number of data need to be compared in a single window (C2). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 16</ref> shows the procedure of detecting an emerging event on STBins. Once the signal of an emerging event is observed (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure  16a</ref>), we tend to select a few segments and explore more detail (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 16b</ref>). Note that it will not lead to a better result to select as many segments as possible, since that will dilute the importance of actual relevant tags. The selected segments should belong to either multiple users in the center of interaction (relatively stronger similarity between segments of a sequence), or a single active user across many windows. A ranking list of tags is then provided for further selection (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure  16c</ref>). Here, based on domain knowledge, relatively unique tags are preferred and selected rather than general ones, e.g. geotags and date. As a result of tag selection, event duration and diffusion, as well as user behavior within the events can be visually observed. We evaluated the detection results based on the ground truth. First, we filtered out events that are not emerging from the ground truth. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 17</ref> shows the distributions of events on number of photos, as well as event length. With both distributions long-tailed, we expected to see emerging events in the long tails. Hence, a 50% cutoff is applied to filter out the non-emerging events. This cutoff results in filtering out events that contain less than 20 photos in total and last for less than 2 hours. As a result, 50 events were kept, from where we correctly detected 36 events to be emerging (recall of 72%), with 8 false positive detections (precision of approximately 82%). We looked back to those events that we failed to detect and found their common point: only one user is involved within 2 to 3 hours. Those misdetected events are quite similar to the daily-life events in the dataset, which are considered as noisy events in the task. We believe that this is the reason why STBins cannot help to distinguish those events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2">Analysis and Results</head><p>Additionally, we clearly observed two different patterns of user behavior in detected emerging events. We found that more users were involved in events of Indignados movement, but basically they choose to distract from the event within a relatively short period (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure  18a</ref>). However, users behaved quite differently in most of the soccer and technical events detected, where typically only one user was involved but concentrating for much longer time (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 18b and 18c)</ref>. The different user behaviors may help distinct two categories of emerging events, which attract either many fast-in-fast-out users or only a few users, focused on one event. Similarly, characterizing emerging trends by exogeneity and endogeneity has been suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>.</p><p>In general, we demonstrated the usage of STBins on Flickr data  for detecting emerging events. By using STBins, not only emerging events, but also user behavior was observable. Interestingly, we clearly detected two different patterns of user behavior, which seems to have the potential to distinguish emerging events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper introduces STBins, a visualization technique for visually tracking multiple sequences and their similarity over time, and this technique comes to be the main contribution of this work that addresses the research questions: individual sequences are directly rendered for tracking their temporal change (Q1), while sequence similarity is directly presented based on temporal binning for periodical sequence comparison (Q2). These two features together make it possible to track the change of sequence similarity over time (Q3). Meanwhile, limitations faced by previous research are considered in our visual design. No complex visual encoding is required for mapping data values with large variety (C1). Details of data can be explored through interaction and additional linked views. Also, sequence similarity is presented and summarized, even though a large amount of data is involved in one comparison (C2). For demonstrating the usage of STBins, we applied it to two real-world datasets that are typical in their domains. The datasets are different regarding our technique, where one contains a few long sequences and another contains many short sequences. As a visual technique designed for visualizing data sequences in general, we expect STBins to be useful in other domains as well.</p><p>Considering limitation of STBins, the vertical scalability is relatively limited (maximum 35 sequences clearly presented in one screen, with resolution of 1920×1200). We argue that this issue cannot be perfectly solved by the existing techniques due to the conflict between the limited screen space and the arbitrarily large size of real-world data. Also, sometimes it is only necessary to display sequences that are relevant to the analyzing task at hands. Hence, we suggest a solution of applying a "context+focus" strategy to fold or aggregate less relevant sequences into super sequences, so that the context information can be partially kept within limited screen space. Here, the most relevant sequences are indicated by users while the rest are less relevant. Meanwhile, for establishing the horizontal scalability of STBins, applying temporal binning with scrolling already helps, but the scalability can still be limited while presenting a large number of windows in one screen (e.g. showing a long region with small window size). In this case, techniques like perspective wall <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref> may help further enlarge the visual scalability.</p><p>Meanwhile, using STBins should be assisted by automatic approaches for better exploration of data. For users who know exactly what they are looking for, a querying function with a well designed query language can support the quick searching. In contrast, for users with no target, an overview highlighting potential interesting parts, e.g. the densest region of a sequence, may be the solution.</p><p>Furthermore, one may think about the limitation caused by temporal binning. Advantage of temporal binning is that it allows a simple and adjustable view. However, binning approach also results in the difficulty of observing sequence similarity in different windows or cross binning boundary. In this research, we consider this limitation to be minor, since STBins is not proposed for detecting similar partitions of multiple sequences, but for answering questions raised while tracking data sequences and their similarity over time.</p><p>For future work, in addition to eliminating the above limitations, we would like to further explore the design space of both visualization and interaction. Also, we expect to examine the usage of STBins in other domains, such as network security and business management, where data sequence analysis plays an important role as well. Furthermore, we want to explore the application of STBins on streaming data. Although the visual design of STBins is suitable for streaming data, there are still some points, e.g. maximum data volume allowed and updating speed, that should be investigated.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Overview of our user tasks.</figDesc></figure>
