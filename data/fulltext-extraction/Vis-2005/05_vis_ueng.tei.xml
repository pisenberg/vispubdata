			<abstract>
				<p>Doppler radars are useful facilities for weather forecasting. The data sampled by using Doppler radars are used to measure the distributions and densities of rain drops, snow crystals, hail stones, or even insects in the atmosphere. In this paper, we propose to build up a graphics-based software system for visualizing Doppler radar data. In the system, the reflectivity data gathered by using Doppler radars are post-processed to generate virtual cloud images which reveal the densities of precipitation in the air. An optical flow based method is adopted to compute the velocities of clouds, advected by winds. Therefore, the movement of clouds is depicted. The cloud velocities are also used to interpolate reflectivities for arbitrary time steps. Therefore, the reflectivities at any time can be produced. Our system composes of three stages. At the first stage, the raw radar data are re-sampled and filtered to create a multiple resolution data structure, based on a pyramid structure. At the second stage, a numeric method is employed to compute cloud velocities in the air and to interpolate radar reflectivity data at given time steps. The radar reflectivity data and cloud velocities are displayed at the last stage. The reflectivities are rendered by using splatting methods to produce semi-transparent cloud images. Two kinds of media are created for analyzing the reflectivity data. The first kind media consists of a group of still images of clouds which displays the distribution and density of water in the air. The second type media is a short animation of cloud images to show the formation and movement of the clouds. To show the advection of clouds, the cloud velocities are displayed by using two dimensional images. In these images, the velocities are represented by arrows and superimposed on cloud images. To enhance image quality, gradients and diffusion of the radar data are computed and used in the rendering process. Therefore the cloud structures are better portrayed. In order to achieve interactive visualization, our system is also comprised with a view-dependent visualization module. The radar data at far distance are rendered in lower resolutions, while the data closer to the eye position is rendered in details.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>A Doppler radar is used for the measurement of rainfall intensity. It sends out microwave pulses toward the air. When the waves hit objects, small fractions of the waves are scattered back to the antenna of the radar. The reflectivities are transformed into scalar values to represent the density of precipitation in the air. The radar can rotate 360 degrees about the vertical axis. For each degree of angle, the radar sends out pulses to sense the particles in the air. The densities of particles are measured at equidistant points along each ray. After completing a circular scanning, the radar raises up its elevation angle by several degrees and performs the circular scanning again [1, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6]</ref>. The sample points of the radar are located on multiple layers of concentric conical surfaces. The data set contain millions of points and is too large to be analyzed by hand. Therefore computer programs are employed for post-processing these data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Previous Work</head><p>Many computer algorithms have been designed for post-processing meteorological data. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>, a multiresolution method is presented for visualizing weather radar data. In their method, a hierarchical structure of tetrahedral meshes is created upon the data. Lower representations of the data are used for displaying areas of small variation while higher resolution representations are rendered for exploring important features. Clouds are displayed by compositing multiple transparent iso-surfaces. Djurcilov and Pang developed another iso-surface based visualization technique for processing radar data. In their method, the radar data are filtered at first to smooth the data and to recover missing values. Then iso-surfaces are created to show the distribution of precipitation in the air <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. These two isosurface visualization methods suffer from missing the fine details of the cloud structure. The appearance of clouds generated by their systems does not look natural when compared with satellite cloud images. Treinish presents a method for visualizing scattered meteorological data <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>. In his method, a mesh is imposed upon the domain at first. Then the data are re-sampled at the mesh vertices such that traditional visualization softwares and hardwares can be utilized for displaying the data. His system has been successfully used for showing the rainfall distribution in Peru. Jang et al. design a LoD visualization system for radar data. At first the data set is split to create a hierarchical data structure, the volume tree. Then splatting volume rendering is used to render the data to reveal radar reflectivities. They also used view-dependent strategies to improve the performance of their rendering process. However, lacking of a good lighting method and any cloud structure enhancement skill, the images generated by these two systems do not reveal the details of the clouds.</p><p>A visualization system called D3D is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>. The system was developed based on its precedent system, Vis5D, and new functionalities are added such that both 3D and 2D meteorological data can be processed. The authors suggest that 2D graphical figures may be superior to 3D volume rendering images in certain applications. However, 3D volume visualization offers better resolution and comprehension for examining the meteorological data that are three-dimensional in nature, for example, clouds. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>, a 4D graphics system is presented for processing meteorological data. Weather data, collected or computed, are illustrated by using 2D or 3D graphics techniques. Textures are added to enhance image quality.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IEEE Visualization 2005</head><p>October 23-28, Minneapolis, MN, USA 0-7803-9462-3/05/$20.00 Â©2005 IEEE. sequence of images is generated to display the animation of clouds. Some other advanced graphics systems for processing weather simulation and observation data are overviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>. These systems are designed and established by European meteorologists and computer scientists for processing large scientific data obtained from weather forecasting simulation and observation systems. Papathomas et al. review the applications and development of computer graphics systems which are dedicated to the field of meteorology <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Other researchers construct software systems which are capable of simulating, interpolating, and visualizing atmospheric phenomena. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>, a visual procedure is presented for calculating and displaying the movement of clouds between two large time steps. The objects in the space are divided into two categories, the clouds and the air (no cloud). The wind flow fields are interpolated through the time by using Rung-Kutta method. Then the objects are traced backward and forward in the flow field. The results of the backward and forward particle-tracing are combined together to create the density field of clouds in the space. The cloud densities are visualized by using volume rendering techniques. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28]</ref>, simulation and portraying algorithms for clouds are proposed. The cloud densities are computed on regular grids by using simulation programs based on CML method. Their cloud simulation models are based on realistic aero-dynamics phenomena of the atmosphere. Initial conditions and boundary conditions are controllable by users. Fast numerical methods are developed for the calculation. The results are shown by using splatting volume rendering skills. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">29]</ref>, illumination model and new rendering procedures are proposed for visualizing clouds.

These methods use simplified governing equations of aero-dynamics physics to compute the development sequence of clouds or smoke.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Overview</head><p>In this article, a software system for visualizing Doppler radar data is presented. Our system is comprised with three stages. At the first stage, the raw radar data are re-sampled on regular grid points and filtered to reduce noise. Seven light-maps are calculated to record the intensities of the grid points. Then a Level-of-detail (LoD) structure is created upon the regular grid. Since the radar systems output data at fixed time steps. Numerical methods are employed at the second stage to compute the velocities of clouds in the air and use the velocity field to transport clouds to interpolate cloud density at specific time points. Then the radar data and velocities of clouds are rendered at the third stage. The radar data are rendered by using a splatting method to generate still cloud images and short movies to reveal the distribution and density of water in the air. The velocities and clouds are blended together to produce images which display the development and movement of the clouds.</p><p>Compared with other radar data visualization systems, our system possesses the following improvements: First, the gradients and the diffusion of the precipitation are computed and used to adjust the rendering computation such that the cloud appearance is more vivid, and fine details of clouds are depicted. Second, a sophisticated lighting method is utilized in our system to approximate the scattering effects of clouds. Thus the clouds are better shaded. Third the velocities of clouds are computed and displayed. Therefore, the advection of cloud can be analyzed or even predicted. Fourth, by using the cloud velocities and tracing the trajectories The brief structure of our radar data visualization system is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The system is composed of five major modules: The filtering and re-sampling module reads in the raw data and resmples the data on regular grid points. Then the data are filtered by using a median filter and a Gaussian low-pass filter to reduce noise. The functionalities of the numerical interpolation module include the calculation of the wind fields and the interpolation of radar data in time domain. The LoD structure construction module will creates LoD representations for each set of radar data. The lightmaps of the data are computed by the light map calculation module. The last module is the volume rendering module. It takes the LoD representations, the velocities, and the light maps as input and perform splatting volume rendering to generate still cloud images or movies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STRUCTION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Re-sampling and Filtering</head><p>The Doppler radar data come with polar coordinates in nature. This prohibits efficient rendering processing. Therefore a non-uniform regular grid is imposed on the domain. To create the grid, a bounding box is constructed at first. The bottom face of the bounding box covers a rectangular area with the width and length of several hundred kilo-meters (kms). The bottom face is about 0.3 km above the ground. Since the space higher than 20 kms above the sea level contains very little relevant information, the vertical extents of the bounding box is confined to 20 kms above the ground. A Cartesian coordinate system is associated with the domain such that the grid point coordinates can be determined. The location of the radar is selected as the origin. The horizontal plane is expanded by the X and Z axes while the Y axis is parallel with the vertical direction. The bounding box is divided into 24 layers of horizontal planes. The distance between every two layers of the planes is nonuniform. It is about 0.4 km if the planes are under 4 kms above the ground. Then the distance is gradually increased as the elevation gets higher. The distance becomes about 0.8 km when the elevation is between 4 and 10 kms above the ground. Once the height is above 10 km the distance is increased to 2 km. On each horizontal plane, a 2D uniform grid of 512x512 points is generated, and the 3D grid is created.</p><p>When the mesh is created, the radar reflectivities are re-sampled at the grid points by using tri-linear interpolation performed in the polar coordinate system. To reduce noise, a median filter is used to filter out data of extreme values, then a Gauss filter is used to smooth the re-sampled data. Then the gradients of the reflectivity are computed at all grid points. The gradients show the directions and tendency of the variation of the radar reflectivity. They are used to reshape and rotate the footprints in the splatting volume rendering. Beside the gradients, the diffusion of the radar reflectivity is computed too. The diffusion of a density field reveals the concentration of the density. A high diffusive value implies a higher concentration of the density. Diffusive values are used to adjust the variation of the footprint functions utilized in the splatting volume rendering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Level-of-Detail Construction</head><p>Once the data re-sampling is completed, a new level of grid is generated upon the original grid. The resolution of the new grid is twice coarser than the original grid in X and Z directions while the resolution in the vertical direction is unchanged. The grid point coordinates, the radar reflectivities, the gradients, and the diffusion values are calculated at all new grid points by using tri-linear interpolation performed in the previous layer of grid. By following this strategy, other layers of grid with reduced resolutions can be generated. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the flow chart of the first stage. The raw radar data are sampled to generate the level 1 grid, which is downsampled to produce the next level of grid. In our implementation, three levels of grids are constructed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">STAGE TWO: VELOCITY COMPUTATION AND INTERPO-</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LATION</head><p>The radar systems produce the data sets at fixed time steps. The sampling times of two consecutive radar sets may be six or eight minutes apart. When generating a movie by using these data sets, the time gaps are too large to produce a sequence of images which is smooth enough to describe the motion and variation of clouds. Therefore, numerical methods are required to interpolate radar data at any time point.</p><p>The motion and variation of clouds are affected by three factors: advection by wind, raining, and evaporation. We assume that the raining and evaporation are not crucial effects; and cloud particles are assumed to be massless and traveling within the wind fields. Therefore, the shapes and distribution of clouds vary with the velocity of wind. However, the radar system can only measure the speed of wind in the directions of the radar rays. Some searchers have developed algorithms to calculate wind velocities by using multiple radars <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13]</ref>. These methods use the wind speed data measured by using two or more Doppler radars and augment with the mass conservation law to compute wind velocities. For regions scanned by only one radar, different approaches have been designed for the velocity computation. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref>, Tuttle and Gall use two echo-tracking algorithms to estimate the wind velocities of tropical cyclones. In their method, the radar reflectivity data of two consecutive radar scans are compared and analyzed to calculate the velocity backward. Their method is only good for tropical cyclones, since the patterns of tropical cyclones are clear and the maximum speed can be estimated. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>, Shapiro et al. propose another method to compute wind velocities. In their method, they assume the velocity components are linear functions of time variable. Then the equation of the radial component of the velocity is derived, and the concept of the mass conservation law is served as constraints. Finally, the velocity is calculated by minimizing a cost function.</p><p>In our work, we assume the vertical component of the wind field is small and can be neglected. Therefore, the wind field is composed of two horizontal components. We solve the following governing equations to obtain the horizontal wind field:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">â I â x * u + â I â y * v = â â I ât , â 2 u = 0, â 2 v = 0,</formula><p>where I is the reflectivity, u and v are the components of velocity, and t is the time variable. The first equation is the classic optical flow constraint. It is solved by using hierarchical Lucas-Kanade method <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>. The second and third equations are served as smooth constraints. They are used to smooth the computed velocity field. The position of a cloud particle is changed if it is advected by the wind. We adopt the following governing equation to model the motion of a cloud particle:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">â X(t) ât = V (t, X),</formula><p>where X(t) represents the position of the particle at time t, and V (t, X) is the velocity. This equation can be solved by using Euler's method or Rung-Kutta method to obtain the trajectory of a particle, if the velocity field is known. The velocity field is computed for two reasons. The first is to display the motion of clouds, and the second is to interpolate reflectivities. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, the image of the velocity field of a Doppler radar data set is shown. The velocities are rendered by using red arrows. The orientations of these arrows describe the velocity directions while the velocity magnitudes are represented by the arrow lengths. These arrows are super-imposed on a cloud image to show the motion and swirling of clouds inside a typhoon. The second usage of velocities is to interpolate data. Radar data are sample at fixed time steps. If the gaps of time steps are too large, it is difficult to generate smooth image sequence. Therefore data at some middle points between two steps have to be generated. Another reason to perform data interpolation is to synchronize data among Doppler radars. Utilizing several radars to gather data enables us to obtain climate information in wider ranges. However, the radars may be produced by different vendors and operated independently. They sense data at different time steps, depending on their mechanical limits. Their data can not be mixed together before a data synchronization has be completed. We use the velocity field to advect clouds backward or forward to generate radar data at fixed time points to resolve these two problems. Compared with some traditional interpolation methods, that use spline functions for calculate intermediate data, our method possesses higher precision and preserves the features of clouds. An image is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> to compare our method with linear interpolation method. The results generated by using our method are displayed in the lower left image, the data created by using linear interpolation method are presented in the lower right image, and the exact data is portrayed in the upper middle image. Linear interpolation method tends to smooth out details and produces fuzzy images. Our method advects cloud masses along the wind, and the structures of clouds are preserved. A sequence of images produced by using our advection interpolation method is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. The image on the lower left corner is the data scanned by a radar at step 0, and the image on the upper left corner shows the data scanned at step 1. Two data sets are generated between these two steps and displayed on the right side of the figure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">STAGE THREE:SPLATTING VOLUME RENDERING</head><p>To visualize the Doppler radar data, users are asked to select a level of grid in the LoD representation. The target grid is volumerendered by using a splatting method. In this method, all grid points are parallelly projected onto the image plane in back-to-front order. The projection of a grid point is replaced by a semi-transparent billboard. The color and opacity of the billboard are determined by searching a colormap, based on the radar reflectivity of the point. Then the billboard is modulated with a texture which is generated by using a footprint function which is a 2D Gaussian function. Our splatting procedure is based on the algorithms proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">42]</ref>. The footprints of all grid points are composited in back-to-front order to form the final image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">The Effects of Diffusion and Gradient</head><p>The gradient of a scalar function, f , at a certain point (x, y, z) is defined by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">â f = [ â f â x , â f â y , â f â z ].</formula><p>The gradient possesses two important properties: First, it represents the direction and magnitude of the maximum variation of the function. Secondly, if the gradient is non-zero, it is the normal vector of the isosurface passing through the point <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">8]</ref>. The second property is used in our procedure to adjust the shape and orientation of footprints. When computing the footprint of a grid point, the gradient of the point is projected onto the projection plane to generate a 2D vector. If the 2D vector is zero, the footprint is not modified. Otherwise, the billboard of the point is rotated such that its y-axis is parallel with the 2D vector. Furthermore, the billboard can be regarded as a patch tangent to the isosurface passing through the point. The visible portion of the billboard should be narrow if the gradient and the view direction is almost orthogonal. Therefore, the linear interpolation advection sampled data  billboard is scaled down in its y-axis by using the following scaling factor:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">S f = max( g g â¢ v, 0.2),</formula><p>where g is the gradient, and v is the view direction. The scalar value, 0.2, is a threshold to avoid producing degenerated footprints. The reshaping and rotation of billboard are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref>. The original billboard is shown on the right part of the figure while the rotated and reshaped billboard is depicted on the left part of the figure.</p><p>The diffusion of function, f , is defined by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">â 2 f = â 2 f â x 2 + â 2 f â y 2 + â 2 f â z 2 .</formula><p>The diffusion of f at a position,x, can be used to measure the difference between f (x) and the average value of f around x <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">8]</ref>. To improve image quality, the diffusion of the radar reflectivity is calculated at each point. The absolute values of the diffusion are used to adjust the variance of footprint function in the splatting volume rendering. If the value is large, the radar reflectivity is much denser at the point than the surrounding area. The variance of the footprint function is reduced to reflect the concentration of radar reflectivity.</p><p>On the other hand, if the diffusive value is small, the radar reflectivity does not vary much at the point. Therefore the variance of the footprint function is increased. The splatting of the point is wider and thinner. A formulation has been deduced for scaling the footprint function variance. Initially, the footprint function variance is Ï 0 when the diffusion value is zero. When the diffusion value becomes D f , the new footprint function variance, Ï , is computed by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Ï = Ï 0 max(1, ln D f )</formula><p>.</p><p>To our knowledge, the utilization of diffusion in splatting volume rendering has never be studied. However, based on our testing, the image quality can be significantly improved if the diffusion is taken into consideration for rendering low resolution data. We have successfully applied this effect in rendering unstructured data and some results can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>.</p></div>

Then the cloud voxels are projected onto the raster in back-to-front order. Before a voxel is projected, the center of the projection on the raster is computed first, and the intensity at the position is retrieved. This value is treated as the intensity of the cloud voxel and stored. Then the voxel is projected, and the intensities of the raster pixels covered by the projection are attenuated to emulate the blocking of sun-light by the cloud voxel. By repeating the process, the intensities of all cloud voxels are obtained.</p><p>In our work, we use the similar method to compute the intensities of grid points. However, seven light sources are used in our procedure as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. In our illumination model, the sun is the prime light source. The other light sources include the rays from the sky dome and the reflection from the ground. A hemi-cube with 5 faces is used for replacing the sky dome. The directions of the rays coming from the sky are assumed to be orthogonal to the hemi-cube faces. Therefore 5 different directional light sources are used for calculating the lighting intensities contributed by the sky rays. We assume that the ground is a flat plane, and it reflects all lights along its normal direction. Thus, a directional light source is utilized for replacing the reflection light from the ground. There are totally 7 directional light sources in the scene. The colors and intensities of the light sources are controllable by users. The intensities of the grid points produced by the light sources are calculated by using the method mentioned above in the preprocessing stage and stored along with the grid points. The intensities are used to shade the grid points during the splatting volume rendering.</p></div>

The radar reflectivities are rendered by using the splatting method without taking the gradients into consid- The effect of diffusion is obvious when the data resolution is low or when the eye position is closer to the clouds. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref>, the resolution of grid is 512x512x24. It is the finest grid of the LoD representation. On the left image of this figure, the clouds are rendered without taking diffusion into account while the right image is produced with diffusion effect. The areas with high reflectivity variation are enhanced in the right image. More details of the clouds are revealed near the eye of the typhoon. Then the eye position is moved away from the data, and another two images are generated by rendering the middle resolution grid which contains 256x256x24 points. These two pictures are displayed in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. The right image, with diffusion effect, shows the internal structure of the the clouds better than the left image, which is produced without applying diffusion effect. The areas with high reflectivities are easier to be identified in the right image. The dark-red circle near the left border of the image is not the typhoon eye. Instead, it is the location of the radar. Since the elevation angle of the radar is limited. The cone directly above the radar contains no data. Therefore, the clouds are cut by the conic surface and the internal structure of the clouds is visible. This cone is sometimes called the cone of silence. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>, the eye position is put far away from the data. The images are rendered by using the lowest resolution grid, composing of 128x128x24 points. Since the resolution is low, some details are lost in the images. However, the right image, rendered with diffusion effect, preserves more features than the left image, rendered without diffusion effect. The distribution of the radar reflectivity is better illustrated in the picture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Test Result Two</head><p>In the second set of tests, the radar data are volume rendered to generate virtual realistic cloud images. The radar reflectivities are rendered in white color. The reflectivity intensities are utilized as the opacities of clouds. In order to achieve better results, gradients and diffusive values are taken into account in the visualization. The images are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 11, 12</ref>, and 13. These images are gen- erated by rendering the grids of the three resolutions respectively. The image of the finest resolution data is displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>, the visualization result of the middle resolution data is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> contains the cloud image of the lowest resolution data. As the data resolution becomes lower, the details of the clouds are getting fuzzy. However, the cloud masses are well preserved in all images. The appearance of the typhoon is still clear and realistic even in the image of the lowest resolution data.</p><p>The benefit of reducing data resolution is to speed up the processing time. The costs, measured by second, to create the images are depicted in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The resolution of the images is 700x700 pixels. They are produced by using a Pentium IV machine with 512M main memory and a 2.0GHz cpu. The reduction ratio of data between two consecutive levels of grids is 4. Ideally, the rendering cost will be declined by 4 times once the data resolution is reduced by one level. However, some overheads are involved in the computation. The overhead costs can not be decreased as the data resolution is lowered. Therefore the speed-up is slightly below 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, a visualization system is proposed for post-processing Doppler radar data. By using a splatting volume rendering method augmented with the effects of gradients and diffusive values, clear  visualization results are achieved even when the images are generated by rendering lower resolution data. Our system provides the capacity of generating realistic cloud images and comprehensible colorful images. Therefore, the key features of the radar data are explicitly revealed. It takes minutes for a modern meteorological radar to complete an entire scanning process. The time step between two consecutive scanning is too large to generate a smooth sequence of images for animation. Therefore, interpolation procedures are required for estimating the movement and development of clouds between every two time steps. To achieve better accuracy, the velocity field in the space should be taken into consideration for the interpolation. According to the Doppler shift effect, a Doppler radar can detect the movement of a cloud mass. However, the velocity of the movement cannot be exactly measured except in the radial direction of the radar. Based on an optical flow computing method, we calculate the velocity field of cloud. Then the velocities are rendered to show the tendency of cloud motion. The velocities are also used to advect cloud particles to interpolate radar data at time points selected by users.</p><p>The precipitation may be changed because of rain-fall, water evaporation from the ground, and the advection of wind between two time steps. In our current work, we ignore raining and evaporation effects to achieve quick results. Some models have been developed to estimate rain-fall and evaporation and predict weather. However, these models are still not accurate enough for weather forecasting. Complicated terrain also creates difficult for scanning data by using Doppler radars. To overcome these problems is of the highest priority in visualizing Doppler radar data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Modules of the radar data visualization system of cloud particles, we are able to interpolate reflectivities more accurate.</figDesc></figure>

Two groups of images are generated. Each group consists of three images. The images are produced by rendering the three levels of the LoD representation. The radar reflectivities are converted into colors and opacities. Dark-red color represents high reflectivities while median reflectivities are portrayed by green and yellow colors. Low reflectivities are rendered with light-blue and white colors. To render the images of the first group, the diffusive values are ignored. All points are splatted by using the same footprint function. When producing the images of the second group, the diffusive values are employed to adjust the variances of the footprint functions. Large diffusive values result in small variances. The visualization results are shown inFigures 8, 9, and 10.</figDesc></figure>
