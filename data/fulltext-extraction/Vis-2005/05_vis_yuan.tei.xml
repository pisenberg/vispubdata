<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Large fluid dynamical simulations performed on supercomputer systems produce huge data sets with both high resolutions and high precision values. One typical data set we deal with in this paper is from the vorticity volumetric simulation by Mach 1 homogeneous compressible turbulence <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> using the gas dynamics Piecewise-Parabolic Method (PPM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> on a grid of 2048 3 cells. This simulation was run on the TeraGrid cluster at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) using a number of dual-CPU machines that varied between 80 and 250 nodes over the course of a 2-month run <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>Such data sets impose several issues on visualization performed on commodity graphics hardware when a high fidelity visualization is desired. First, the data generated is in 32-bit floating point precision. Quantizing it to 8-bit scalar values to fit the texture-based volume rendering on commodity graphics hardware will severely degrade the data quality and lose subtle, but important details.</p><p>Second, the number of sampling slices must be comparable with the spatial resolution of the volume data to ensure sufficient volume sampling. It is necessary to set the opacity of each slice small enough to allow as many slices as possible, hence maximizing the number of phenomena that will be visible to the user. This requires very low opacity assignment for each slice; consequently, the opacity value will be rounded to zero in a low precision rendering system. Therefore, it is desirable to have high precision compositing so that detailed structures residing in the data can be preserved.</p><p>The third issue is the transfer function design. To handle high precision data sets, the transfer function should have comparable axis resolutions for both intensity and color/opacity. Displaying and editing transfer functions with up to thousands of entries on regular displays (1K − 2K pixel resolution) presents another challenge.</p><p>Lastly, on the output side, with the intermediate image of high precision computed, simply rounding pixel values to regular display scales would lose the computed details. It is preferable to be able to retainas much of the computed high precision (i.e., high dynamic range -HDR) visualization as possible and provide dynamic color intensity mapping (i.e., tone mapping) for regular displays.</p></div>

Our method performs high precision volume rendering followed by dynamic tone mapping to preserve details on regular display devices. With the input from the user, our system automatically adjusts the tone reproduction for the final display to enhance selected features. Our system is also able to directly output the rendering results to high dynamic range video which can be played by HDR viewing software available in public domain. We also present a novel transfer function design interface with non-linear magnification of intensity range and logarithmic scaling of color/opacity range to facilitate high dynamic volume visualization. By leveraging modern commodity graphics hardware and out-of-core acceleration, our system can produce interactive visualization of huge volume data. The pipeline of our system is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The main contributions of this paper are twofold:</p><p>1.

We present a novel transfer function design interface with non-linear magnification for high dynamic range volume data;</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly review related work. We discuss technical issues involved in high dynamic range volume visualization in Section 3; this includes high precision alpha compositing (Section 3.1), a new transfer function design interface for high dynamic range volume rendering (Section 3.2), and tone reproduction (Section 3.3). Implementation details are described in Section 4 followed by results and discussions (Section 5). Finally we present our conclusions in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Dynamic range is defined as the ratio between the maximum and the minimum non-zero tonal values in an image. While 8-bitsper-channel image representation is popular, high dynamic range scenes are pervasive in nature. In recent years, obtaining and displaying high dynamic range images have received a lot of attention in the computer graphics community. Algorithms have been developed for capturing both photographs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and videos <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> with extended dynamic range. Simultaneously, tone mapping operators <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> have also been developed to reduce the dynamic range so that HDR images can be displayed on normal 8-bits-per-channel displays. In general, two types of tone reproduction operators have been proposed: global (spatially uniform) operators and local (spatially varying) operators <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Global operators apply the same transformation to every pixel in an image. A global operator may depend upon the contents of the image as a whole, so long as the same transformation is applied to every pixel. Conversely, local operators apply a different scale to different parts of an image. In addition to reducing the range of luminance, tone reproduction can also be used to mimic perceptual qualities, resulting in an image which provokes the same responses as when viewing the scene in the real world. With the development of commodity graphics hardware, many tone mapping algorithms could be accelerated on graphics hardware <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Recently, a high dynamic range display device has been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> based on a combination of an LCD panel and a DLP projector.</p><p>The benefits of rendering high dynamic range output, especially its applications to visualization, have not been seriously explored. For direct volume rendering, each voxel contributes to the final image by an alpha compositing operation. For large volume data with highly uneven distribution in intensity, rendered images are likely to have very different brightnesses between highlights and dark regions. High dynamic range rendering techniques are necessary to preserve all rendering details. Only very recently, Ghosh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> investigate the use of high dynamic range display technology for volume rendering. Their emphasis is on mapping of the transfer function to a perceptually linear space over the range of intensities that one high dynamic image display can produce. The goal is to reserve several just noticeable difference (JND) steps of intensities for spatial context apart from clearly depicting the main regions of interest. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation on high dynamic range volume visualization, especially focussing on visualizing large volumetric data sets with both high resolution and high precision generated from large scale computer simulations. We also target popularly available 8-bit display devices.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PLAY</head><p>In this section we discuss three issues pertaining to high dynamic range volume visualization and display: alpha precision, transfer function design, and tone mapping.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Alpha Precision for Large Volume Data Visualization</head><p>In volume rendering, each sample is assigned an alpha value and alpha blending is performed during compositing on the rendered images in a back to front order according to the formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C N = (1 − e −τ ) C C + e −τ C O (1) τ = α g α C d x<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where C N are the red, green, and blue color channels of the composited (i = O), new (i = N), and current (i = C) volume sample at each pixel. α C is the alpha value of the current rendering plane at the associated pixel, α g is the global alpha. The distance between two consecutive samples along the ray is d x . A simple emission model is applied here without extra shading effects. In this way, every sample contributes to the final rendering. On the other hand, the alpha blending exponentially decreases each sample's contribution. As an example, let us look at a volume data of n slices. In the following discussion, we assume our sampling rate is the same as the data frequency of the volume data, e.g. one sample per voxel. Assuming that every voxel is assigned with the same opacity value α, the contribution of the furthest voxel to the rendered image will be decreased by a factor of (1 − α) n . To guarantee the final contribution to be no less than r, the α value must be set as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">α = 1 − e log(r)/n<label>(3)</label></formula><p>For data sets with a size of 2048 3 , when r is 0.1, the alpha has to be less than 0.00112; when r is 0.01, alpha has to be smaller than 0.00225. In such cases, the rendering system with only 8 bits per channel will quantize the alpha value to zero and voxel regions with such low alpha values will not contribute to the rendered image. Furthermore, to achieve higher rendering quality, as the number of slices needs to be much higher than the size of volume (at least twice according to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem), the preferred α value would even be smaller. For high dynamic range volume rendering, samples of such low α values must still contribute to the final image. This requires high precision of the alpha values. As an example, for 16-bit float representation, the highest precision is 2 −24 . This makes it possible to render volumes of 2048 3 resolution.</p><p>In addition to the transfer function, which is discussed in the next subsection, we define a global parameter α g for adjusting the global opacity of the whole volume. This α g value will be multiplied with the opacity returned by the transfer function to get each sample's final opacity for compositing. As an example, the α g value is set to 0.5, 0.05, 0.005 in Figures 2(a), (b) and (c), respectively. The opacity value in the base transfer function ranges from 0 to 0.5 (the same transfer function is used for all three images and is not plotted). All the figures are generated using high precision computation (16 bits) and hence are presented using 16 bits per channel. The dynamic ranges are 3.32 × 10 4 : 1, 1.19 × 10 5 : 1, 2.76 × 10 4 : 1 for Figures 2(a), (b), (c), respectively. The images are linearly mapped to 8 bits for display. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>(c) is much darker compared with the other two images due to the lowest global alpha value used. Not shown in the figure, 8-bits-per-channel rendering with the same transfer function and α g value as those used in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>(c) produces a totally black image. This is because when only 8 bits precision compositing is performed, the smallest α g value used above will lead to zero alpha values for almost all the samples. With high precision computations, we are able to obtain fine details in the rendering result from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>(c) using non-linear tone mapping instead of linear mapping. The result is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Transfer Function Design for High Dynamic Range Volume Rendering</head><p>We develop a novel transfer function design interface for high dynamic range volume visualization.  cannot be differentiated. It is useful to be able to magnify one portion of the intensity region while still keeping other regions visible, following the general concept of focus+context. The focus+context concept allows the simultaneous presentation of global (context) and detail (focus) information in the same display. The fish-eye view technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> allows the user to see an object in the region of interest in detail, and other lower resolution objects peripherally. The advantage of the focus+context technique is that the contextual relationship between the focus center and other context regions is preserved, while giving the user a useful level of control over the regions at hand.</p><p>As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, we develop a focus+context transfer function design interface which performs 1D non-linear scaling on the intensity axis. In our current implementation, we employ a onedimensional transfer function which assigns color and opacity to the volume based on the scalar voxel values. Our system allows the user to switch between RGB space and HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) space <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> during the color specification. Color values are interpolated between user specified knots in HSV space, and then converted to RGB space for later volume rendering. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>(a), a transfer function is displayed in linear scale. The horizontal axis represents normalized intensity values. The green bar at the bottom indicates the intensity range to be magnified, which is specified by the user. The desired amount of magnification is also specified by the user. The goal is to non-linearly scale the intensity axis so that the full intensity range still fits in the horizontal window range. The following formalizes the problem and explains our solution. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>(b) illustrates a magnification curve. The sizes of the circles in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3(c)</ref> indicate the magnification factors of the corresponding locations. Through user input, the interested intensity range R c is magnified by a constant factor of M c &gt; 1. We assume that the rest of the intensity range R min is minified with a factor of M min &lt; 1, which is to be computed. The magnification factors of the transition region R tr are linearly interpolated between M c and M min . R tr is also pre-defined. The task is to compute the value of M min . Since the entire intensity range should still fit in the horizontal window range, the following equation must be satisfied:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x∈R min M min dx + x∈R c M c dx + x∈R tr M tr dx = 1<label>(4)</label></formula><p>This describes an integral of the magnification curve (illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3(c)</ref>). Since the intensity range is normalized into [0, 1], and M c and M min are constant, the equation can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">R min M min + R c M c + x∈R tr M tr dx = 1<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Hence M min can be computed. Non-linear scaling of the intensity axis can then be performed, and the full intensity range is always presented in the view. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3(d)</ref> shows the transfer function of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>(a) in a non-linearly scaled intensity space.</p><p>As illustrated in Figures 3, we design a widget to indicate the intensity range of interest. This widget is described by a center and a width. During transfer function design, the user can click and drag the center of the widget to specify a region of interest for magnification. By clicking elsewhere, the user can change the width of the interested region to be magnified. Another transfer function design task is on the vertical axis for alpha value. As discussed in Section 3.1, the values of alpha in the transfer function must be small enough (e.g., 2 −24 ) to visualize detailed features in a large volume data (e.g., 2048 3 ). One goal of our volume rendering is to be able to display all internal structures simultaneously. A lower range of alpha values is desired because large alpha values will be quickly accumulated to full opacity. Therefore, our transfer function design interface must accommodate the editing of alpha values near zero. The linearly scaled alpha axis provides limited resolution to small alpha values. To address this issue, we use a logarithmically scaled alpha and color axes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, through which small alpha and color values are magnified.</p><p>We combine the logarithmic scaling in the vertical axis and nonlinear scaling in the horizontal axis for the transfer function design. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> illustrates the same transfer function as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3(d)</ref>, however with the vertical axis of the interface scaled logarithmically. This makes it more convenient to edit small alpha values. Moreover, with one portion of the intensity scale magnified, the user can fine tune the transfer function in this region. We allow the user to switch between non-linear and linear transfer function axes for convenience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Tone Reproduction</head><p>While rendered high dynamic range images could leverage the recently developed HDR displays <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, we seek to accommodate popularly available standard display devices. In fact, even an HDR display device has fixed dynamic range. When an HDR image has higher dynamic range than that of the HDR display, tone mapping is still beneficial for display. Our system dynamically maps the volume rendered HDR images to regular images of 8 bits per color channel so that they can be displayed on regular 8-bit display devices.</p><p>The goal of tone reproduction is to compress the dynamic range and at the same time maintain the contrast of the input high dynamic range image. The tone mapping algorithm we adapt belongs to the category of global operators. We choose this algorithm because it works at interactive speeds. On the other hand, using local tone mapping operators <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> which are relatively computationally expensive may achieve better compression results. The volume rendered images generated by our system can also be saved in HDR format images (e.g. Ward's RGBE format <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>) or in HDR movies, which can be viewed off-line using HDR image viewer <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> or HDR movie player <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> available in public domain. For such offline viewing, other state-of-the-art local tone mapping methods can be applied. We choose the adaptive logarithmic mapping operator developed by Drago et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This method is based on logarithmic compression of luminance values. A bias power function is introduced to adaptively vary logarithmic bases, resulting in good preservation of details and contrast. We integrate this tone mapping algorithm with our high dynamic range volume rendering. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>(a) shows an HDR image generated from our HDR visualization. In this image, the HDR intensity is pseudo-color encoded. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5(b)</ref> shows the regular 8-bits-per-channel image after tone mapping. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>(c) shows 9 tone mapped images with increasing exposure levels. This demonstrates the rich information encoded in HDR visualization. Even a static HDR visualization allows users to interact with it and retrieve details of selected points of interest. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref> further illustrates this concept. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6(a)</ref> shows the tone reproduction based on a user specified region of interest. Compared with <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6(b)</ref>, which is based on a different user specification, it can be observed that details and contrasts are retained the best in the regions of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS</head><p>Our high dynamic range volume visualization method is not limited to specific volume rendering implementations. Volume rendering with software implementation approaches can be easily adapted to the high dynamic range paradigm. Special purpose hardware for volume rendering, such as VolumePro <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, can also benefit from the high dynamic range volume by storing results in a high dynamic range format and integrating tone reproduction in the post rendering  and an NVidia 256MB GeForce6800 Ultra graphics card.</p><p>In our system, data sets are organized in a hierarchical brick structure. The current implementation of the rendering module is a simple out-of-core method. Two threads, one for rendering, and another for I/O tasks, are executed simultaneously. Data bricks are read from the hard drive into the main memory upon the request of the rendering thread. During the user navigation or transfer function tuning, the system renders the volume in a lower resolution (e.g. 128 3 or 256 3 ) to achieve interactivity. When the user finishes the interaction, the system automatically loads higher resolutions and render higher quality images.</p><p>We leverage modern graphics hardware to achieve high performance HDR visualization. We explain and analyze how to achieve maximum precision within the constraints of current graphics hardware. For conventional computation, we could use vendor extensions such as NVidia extension GL NV float buffer and support a float color buffer up to 32 bits per channel. However, for volume rendering, it is important to have alpha blending functionality. For this feature, currently only 16-bit float buffer is supported natively at the hardware level. At 24 bits or higher, the performance is reduced dramatically. Therefore, we use 16-bit float buffers in our volume rendering. As discussed earlier, for 16-bit float representation of alpha, the highest precision is 2 −24 . This precision can be used to render a volume data of 2048 3 in size while reasonably preserving the details of the entire volume.</p><p>We employ a texture mapping-based hardware implementation. Volume rendering is implemented using hardware accelerated 3D texture rendering <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Parallel polygon slices perpendicular to the viewing direction are generated and texture mapped with the 3D volume and are composited together in back-to-front order. When rendering a volume of 2048 3 or larger in hardware, an immediate challenge is to cope with the limited graphics card memory. Naturally, we have to develop an out-of-core method so that partial volume data can be efficiently loaded and unloaded to the graphics card memory during the rendering. We also seek time-critical visualization, i.e., we wish to provide instant feedback for user interaction. To achieve these goals, we have developed a multi-resolution volume data structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and level-of-detail (LOD) volume rendering <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> on hardware. The multi-resolution volume data structure is constructed by continuously down-sampling the higher level volume starting from the original volume (as the highest level). For any level volume having size larger than 64 3 , it is subdivided into blocks of 64 3 . When the user interacts with the volume data, volume at a certain level is selected and rendered to keep up with the user interaction. The higher level volume is rendered only when the system enters the idle mode, i.e. no change in rendering pa-rameters is detected. Specifically, for a volume with sub-blocks, its blocks are sorted to the camera position, then a slice order volume rendering is performed with alpha blending. Through this rendering mechanism, we can quickly navigate the volume data and change the transfer function to achieve the desired visualization. We encode transfer functions into textures. For current commodity graphics hardware, the texture size is limited by 4096 in each dimension. To implement transfer functions beyond this size, we encode 1D transfer function into multiple rows of a 2D texture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS</head><p>We have applied our HDR visualization technique to visualize three large fluid dynamics simulations. One simulation data, depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 1, 2, 5</ref>, and 6, shows temperature fluctuations in the deep convection zone of a red giant star <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Large amplitude positive and negative fluctuations are seen near the surface of the star, where they are driven by a nearly constant convective energy flux going through very low density regions. Large negative temperature fluctuations are seen in the large, turbulent, and cool down flowing plume on one side of the star. The warm updraft on the other side of the star is relatively free of turbulence. The temperature field in such a warm updraft is characterized by extremely small amplitude, and small scale, fluctuations around a slightly positive and smoothly varying background temperature. In order to see both large and small amplitude temperature fluctuations in a single visualization, a highly non-linear mapping of temperature to color and intensity is of great importance. Our HDR volume rendering and dynamic tone mapping have made this possible.</p><p>The second simulation data shows turbulent mixing of fluids that typically produces a wide range of concentrations. In a turbulent layer between two pure fluids, some regions will be a substantial blend of both, other regions might be completely unmixed (100% one fluid or the other), while still others might have extremely small fractions of either fluid mixed into the other. The precise values of even minuscule amounts of mixing can be very important. Examples include the dilution of toxins in a blood stream, pollution into the Earth's atmosphere, flows with chemical combustion, and nuclear reaction chains in the flame zones of many stars. Here in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> we show result from a two-fluid PPM simulation where turbulent mixing is driven by shear (256×512×1024). Initially, a region of pure air is right next to, and is in relative motion to, a region of pure Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF 6 ). The interface between these two gasses starts as a plane, and the relative motion corresponds to the two blocks of gas sliding past each other: the initial contact discontinuity is also a slip surface. In addition to the large relative motion there are also small velocity perturbations, which grow with time due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, thereby generating a turbulent mixing layer. The fractional volume of the heavier gas, SF 6 , is followed as a dynamical variable in each computational cell. Fractional volumes range from 0 (pure air) to 1 (pure SF 6 ). As these visualizations show, very small amounts of the heavier gas can be mixed into the air via turbulent churning of the gas. Similarly, very small amount of air can be mixed into the SF 6 . Hence, if the user wishes to follow these very diluted mixtures, high dynamic range is needed for the fractional volume near both zero and unity.</p><p>The third simulation data, depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, shows magnitude of vorticity from a high-resolution (2048 3 ) simulation of homogeneous decaying compressible fluid turbulence <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> when the turbulence is fully developed. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>(a) shows a snapshot in time when the turbulence is in the process of developing. <ref type="figure">Figure 8(b)</ref> is rendered from the same simulation after the turbulence is fully developed. Slip surfaces and intense vortex tubes are clearly visible in the images. The goal of this study is to improve our understanding of inertial range turbulence, with applications in astrophysical flows, such as stellar convection, and the development and testing of subgrid-scale models of turbulence. Since no general theory of fluid turbulence is currently available, volume visualization is important for developing new insights into these flows. Of particular interest is the search for coherent three-dimensional structures, which control the dynamics of the flow. Three-dimensional fluid turbulence naturally produces slip surfaces and intense vortex tubes, which can be seen in the vorticity field here. In systems where a wide range of spatial scales available, such as in this 2048 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> run, values of local vorticity span a wide dynamic range. Since the three-dimensional structure of both weak and strong vorticity is of interest, HDR visualization techniques that can handle such a wide dynamic range of values are very effective for examining these fields. As is evident in these images, one clear advantage for HDR volume visualization isthe rich information retained in one single visualization. A wide range of details can be dynamically viewed on a regular low range display. This can be effectively experienced by playing the HDR movies and tuning the tone mapping parameters. Here, even pre-generated animations offer interactive data exploration opportunities. (Videos clips of high resolution HDR volume rendering movies are available at: http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~xyuan/vis05hdr/)</p><p>As aforementioned in Section 4, we render a volume in a downsampled resolution during navigation for interactive performance. Starting from the highest resolution (level 1), we downsample the volume by a factor of two for each lower level. In our system, the resolution level corresponding to 128 3 is normally selected for interactive navigation. This way, a framerate of over 30 fps can always be achieved during navigation. When the user stops navigation, volume with higher resolution is progressively loaded and rendered to achieve higher rendering quality; this continues until the highest quality is achieved, i.e., the full resolution volume is rendered. Whenever the user restarts the navigation, the system automatically lowers the rendering resolution to sustain an interactive rendering rate. For a high-resolution (2048 3 ) simulation of homogeneous decaying compressible fluid turbulence data set <ref type="figure">(Figure 8</ref>), over 15 seconds is required to achieve the highest rendering quality with the window size of 1024 2 . For a smaller data set (red giant star, 512 3 ), less than 0.5 seconds is required for the full rendering. Note that the rendering time also depends on the number of slices applied per voxel distance. A sampling rate of two slices per voxel distance is used in our experiments.</p><p>Without high dynamic range volume rendering, to perform above rendering on commodity graphics hardware, a mapping must be conducted i which takes the original scalar values to integers in the range [0-255]. Linear mapping is the simplest approach. A log scaling is effective for positive definite quantities with a large dynamic range, such as mass density in stellar convection. Hyperbolic tangent mappings work well for quantities distributed with wide tails, such as vorticity components. However, such mappings require prior knowledge of the volume data set and substantial effort in the preprocessing. In addition, the loss of information is inevitable during the quantization for such mapping. Our HDR volume rendering provides a direct and flexible way of exploiting full information for volume data sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUDING REMARKS</head><p>In this paper, we have presented a high dynamic range volume visualization method for rendering volume data with both high spatial and intensity resolutions. Our method performs high precision volume rendering followed by dynamic tone mapping to preserve details on regular display devices. With interactive input from the user, our system automatically adjusts the tone reproduction for the final display to enhance selected features. In this work, we also present a novel transfer function design interface with non-linear scaling of intensity range and logarithmic scaling of color/opacity range to facilitate HDR volume visualization. By leveraging modern commodity graphics hardware and existing out-of-core acceleration, our system can produce interactive visualization of huge volume data. We have demonstrated the suitability of our system in terms of visualizing large simulation data that has wide range of physical properties. We plan to enhance our transfer function design interface by incorporating some advanced techniques recently developed. For example, we intend to incorporate high dimensional transfer function design <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In such cases, techniques of 2D or higher dimensional magnification such as fisheye <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, hyperbolic space <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> are useful. It is also possible to utilize the information of the volume data and analyze topology, then apply semantic magnification. Since most current tone mapping techniques are developed for photo scenes, we are developing new tone mapping operators suitable for our visualization purposes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>High dynamic range volume rendering using different global alpha α g : (a) α g = 0.5, (b) α g = 0.05, (c) α g = 0.005.
