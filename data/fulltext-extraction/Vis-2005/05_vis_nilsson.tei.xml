<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A wide variety of objects, animals and specimens are scanned for scientific purposes every day in imaging centers across the globe, producing a steady stream of volumetric datasets. Objects such as developing mouse and frog embryos, rat and monkey brains, nerve cells of all types, bones and even fossils are examined by MRI, CT, ET scanners, as well as physically sliced and imaged to produce these 3D samplings of real objects. Once the objects/specimens have been imaged the resulting volume datasets can be manually segmented. In this process, an experienced anatomist goes over selected slices (i.e. images) of the dataset, identifies relevant structures, and circles them with a stylus, producing a series of parallel contours that outline the object of interest.</p><p>From these sets of contours it is usually required to produce a high quality, smooth 3D surface model that reconstructs the original object. The reconstructed surface is useful for visualization and further processing, e.g. resampling and geometric calculations. An important issue that frequently must be addressed during the reconstruction process is the non-uniform resolution of the scanned datasets. Very often the in-plane (X-Y) resolution of a dataset is greater than the out-of-plane (Z) resolution. This difference can range from a factor of 2 to 10. Many approaches have been proposed that stitch the contours together in order to create a polygon mesh. Another class of solutions takes an implicit approach, where 3D fields are derived by stacking and interpolating 2D distance fields constructed from the individual contours.</p><p>Contour stitching algorithms only create polygonal surfaces, thus the resulting reconstructed surfaces have C 0 continuity. Additionally, this class of reconstruction algorithms has not been shown to robustly cope with general, complex, branching structures. We have therefore taken a field-based approach to solving the contour-based reconstruction problem, based on velocity-adjusted contour morphing. With this approach, morphing one contour into the next sweeps out a 3D surface. This is accomplished by equating time in the 2D contour morphing process with the third dimension in the surface reconstruction process. Our approach easily ad-Please see supplementary material on conference DVD.</p></div>

Our work addresses the previously overlooked, but crucial, problem of adjusting the local velocities of the morphing contours in order to guarantee smooth surface transitions at the contour boundaries.</p><p>Our approach consists of four major stages. The reconstruction process takes as input a stack of binary images that represents the contours. When completed, a volumetric model is produced, which may be directly rendered or a mesh can be extracted from it for interactive viewing. In the first stage of our approach a 2D signed distance field is computed to each input contour. The contours may also be smoothed before this stage, if desired. Next a 3D surface is produced by performing a series of 2D level set morphs between adjacent contours embedded in the distance fields. This stage is broken up into two steps. First distance estimates are produced that correspond to the arc lengths of trajectories that connect the adjacent contours in the image plane. Next these distances, together with a time-of-arrival, are used to estimate the speeds (in contour normal directions) needed to produce a smooth morph when transitioning between sets of contours. The 3D reconstruction is rendered in the final stage. The complete process is summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Previous Work</head><p>In the past three decades many significant efforts have addressed the problem of creating surfaces from parallel contours. This work falls into two general categories, contour stitching and field-based methods, which can also be characterized as Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.1">Lagrangian approach: Contour Stitching</head><p>The contour stitching approach to surface reconstruction attempts to generate a surface by connecting the vertices of adjacent contours in order to produce a mesh that passes through all contours. These approaches generally need to address the correspondence (how to connect vertices between contours), tiling (how to create meshes from these edges) and branching (how to cope with slices with different numbers of contours) problems.</p><p>Keppel <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and Fuchs et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> described the first algorithms for creating polygonal meshes from a series of contours. The Fuchs work defines the best reconstructed surface as the one with minimal surface area. Many papers have offered incremental improvements to these seminal efforts. Several solutions to the correspondence problem have been proposed, e.g. those based on parameterization of the contours <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, contour decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Minimum Spanning Trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, Angular Bisector Networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, medial axes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and partial curve matching algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Boissonnat <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> utilizes Delaunay triangulation to cope with branching surfaces. Bajaj et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> provide a unified approach to solving the correspondence, tiling and branching problems by imposing three constraints on the surface when deriving the reconstruction rules. Johnstone et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> describe a method for creating Bezier surfaces from contours with cylindrical topology. Fujimura and Kuo <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> use isotopic deformations to create non-self-intersecting surfaces from nested contours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.2">Eulerian Approach: Field-Based Methods</head><p>Levin <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> presents the seminal field-based approach to surface reconstruction from a series of parallel contours. Given a distance field for each contour, the 2D fields are stacked and interpolated in the z-direction with cubic B-splines. The reconstructed surface is extracted from the resulting 3D field as the zero iso-surface, and in general will only be as smooth as the distance field, i.e. C 0 . Raya and Udupa <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> extend Levin's approach to time-varying datasets. Jones and Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> suggest that Voronoi diagrams be used to minimize the computation needed for calculating the 2D distance fields. Barrett et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> recursively apply morphological operators (dilation and erosion) to contour images in order to interpolate intermediate gray level values. Cohen-Or et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> introduce the concept, without supporting results, of creating a 3D object from contours by morphing one contour into the next using warp-guided distance field interpolation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Contributions</head><p>We present a novel approach to reconstructing closed 3D surfaces from closed 2D contours. The work described here is the first to demonstrate that smooth 3D models can be created from parallel contours by morphing the contours that sweep out a 3D surface. We propose techniques, based on processing all contours simultaneously, that address the continuity problem at contour boundaries, a problem that is usually caused by connecting only two contours at a time; thus producing smooth surface transitions at the contours.</p><p>The approach offers the following additional features:</p><p>• Robustness: Topology changes occurring between input contours are easily handled. Horizontally overlapping contours are guaranteed to be connected in the reconstruction.</p><p>• Accuracy: The 3D reconstructions fit accurately to the input contours. Furthermore the input contours are generally not visible in the reconstruction. The 3D surface is at least C 1 continuous in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the contours. • Flexibility: The reconstruction technique allows for any number of input contours (≥ 2), as well as the application of various constraints (e.g. derivative and height information, etc.). • Efficiency: The computational complexity of our approach is linear in the size (i.e. arc length) of the input contours and thus not dependent on the size of the embedding (i.e. images). It should also be emphasized that all of the (level set) computations in our 3D reconstruction method are exclusively performed in 2D employing a fast improved narrow band scheme (see Appendix A). • Stability: We employ proven finite difference schemes for solving Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Additionally we propose an improved equation for level set morphing. Our modified formulation guarantees exact convergence to within the numerical accuracy of the integration scheme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Surface Reconstruction Pipeline</head><p>In this section we present the details of the 3D reconstruction pipeline outlined in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>. The goal of our approach is to generate smooth surfaces that fit to an arbitrary number of parallel contours. When completed it should not be possible to identify the input contours in the final 3D reconstruction, i.e. the final surface should be at least C 1 continuous in the direction perpendicular to the contours. However, to allow for sharp features in the input contours, the cross sections of the 3D reconstruction may be C 0 continuous. Since our general approach involves morphing one contour into another we refer to the height dimension perpendicular to the contours as time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Novel Eulerian Approach: Level Set Model</head><p>Explicit curve and surface representations that use vertices or control points can be regarded as Lagrangian approaches since they essentially use body-fixed particles. While this formulation offers many advantages for static geometry, it suffers from significant limitations when representing dynamic geometry: aliasing (e.g. undersampling during expansion), failure to easily handle topology changes (e.g. merging or bifurcations) and self-intersections (e.g. formation of loops or swallowtails). Since our general approach for 3D reconstruction is based on metamorphosis it must cope with complex, changing geometry. A more robust approach to processing dynamic geometric models utilizes an Eulerian formulation, where the deforming interface (contour in 2D or surface in 3D) is implicitly represented as a time-dependent iso-surface or contour of a function discretized on a fixed computational grid.</p><p>An elegant Eulerian formulation for deforming closed (i.e. orientable) interfaces is the level set method <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. It represents the interface as a time-dependent Euclidian distance function embedded in a Cartesian space of dimension one higher than the interface (i.e. co-dimension one). A contour may then be conveniently represented as a 2D image of real numbers that sample the shortest distance function, φ, to the contour. A sign convention is used to distinguish between grid points inside (negative) and outside (positive) of the contour. Arbitrary deformation problems may then be recast into a framework that solves the following partial differential equations (PDE),</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∂φ(x(t), t) ∂t = dx(t) dt • ∇φ(x(t), t) = F (x(t), φ(x(t), t), . . . ) |∇φ(x(t), t)| ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where dx(t)/dt denotes the velocity vector of the deforming interface and F () is the speed function that may depend on a variety of arguments. The geometric interpretation of F() defines it as the magnitude of the velocity dx(t)/dt in the direction normal to the interface at x, i.e. F = n • dx(t)/dt. Also note that the local interface normal, n, is given by ∇φ/ |∇φ| and that the mean curvature is ∇ • n, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> for details. The level set PDEs, Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>, can be solved efficiently using several numerical techniques, e.g. the narrow band schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref> and robust finite difference schemes like WENO <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In Appendix A we present a fast and yet relatively straightforward narrow band scheme based on an improvement of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. This scheme guarantees that our final level set reconstruction algorithm has a computational complexity that is linearly proportional to the size of the input contours, as opposed to the size of the images in which they are embedded. For more general information on methods for solving level set equations we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Euclidian Distance Fields From Input Contours</head><p>The input to our algorithm is a set of contours obtained from parallel 2D slices of a closed surface. We assume that the contours are registered in the same frame of reference and that the individual slices each have an associated height. These heights can be user defined or derived directly from the data sets. For contours from topological maps the third dimension normally corresponds to height values and for medical contours the third dimension may be derived from the distances between the slices.</p><p>Since the level set equation, Eq. (1), is a time-dependent Eulerian PDE, it defines an initial value problem. Consequently the first challenge is to derive the initial level sets from the input contours. This amounts to computing Euclidian distance fields from the input contours, which mathematically corresponds to solving the Eikonal equation |∇φ| = 1 with associated boundary conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. This equation can in turn be solved efficiently by a number of numerical methods. For the work presented in this paper we used the Fast Sweeping Method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, which is more efficient than the Fast Marching Method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. This stems from the fact that the computational complexity of the former is O(N ) in the number of grid points N , as opposed to O(N log N ) for the Fast Marching Method. However we also found the steady-state formulation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref> to be useful when the input is binary contours, because the time-dependent PDE approach (see Eq. (6)) provides a slight smoothing of the interface, and hence may be used to anti-alias the binary input. We stress, however, that this smoothing is optional.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Building Block: A Robust Level Set Morphing</head><p>The morph of an initial level set model, φ(x, 0) = φ source (x), to a final level set, φ target (x), can be formulated and solved with the following PDE,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∂φ(x(t), t) ∂t = [φ(x(t), t) − φtarget(x)] |∇φ(x(t), t)| ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>which is evolved to a steady-state where φ and φ target are identical. Eq. (2) directs the portions of the initial interface that are inside the target to expand, and the portions outside to contract. This behavior is produced by the sign convention of φ target , and requires that φ source and φ target overlap; otherwise φ source will collapse to a point. Note that the presence of φ in the speed function, F = φ − φ target , guarantees an exact convergence (i.e. steady-state) within the numerical accuracy of the integration scheme. This speed function is numerically more stable than the original formulations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> where F = −φ target , which is unlikely to be exactly zero for the samples in the discretized narrow band. Consequently no true discretized steady-state solution exists, requiring a manual termination of the propagation when the interface is within a grid point's distance to the target. The improved formulation of Eq. (2) will on the other hand converge accurately to the target level set.</p><p>It is possible to successively apply a 2D version of Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>between all pairs of neighboring input contours to create a 3D surface. Time would then correspond to the height coordinate of the 3D surface that sweeps together the contours. While this approach creates a closed surface it does not necessarily produce a desirable result. The 2D morph is not guaranteed to be C 1 continuous in time across contour boundaries. It will be C 0 , and in most cases will show major discontinuities in the time derivatives across the input contours. This in turn will lead to 3D reconstructions where input contours are clearly visible, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref> (left). To avoid these artifacts a speed function that is at least C 1 , or better yet C 2 , continuous over time must be defined. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref> (right). This is accomplished by assuring that all portions of the contour arrive at the target at the same time, and that the velocity of the morphing contour is the same as it approaches and departs from an input contour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Estimating Distances Between Contours: Lagrangian Particle Tracing</head><p>Each input contour is assigned a time-of-arrival, the time when the morphing contour should reach the input contour. Given our interpretation of time, this value is associated with the height of the input contour. An estimate of the distance traveled by each portion of the deforming contour is required in order to adjust the speed function so that all portions of the contour reach the target simultaneously. This follows from the interpretation of F() as the speed of a point on a deforming contour in the local normal direction. An effective approach to estimating distances for the speedfunction traces particle paths from one contour to the next. The Eulerian morphing of A → B can be augmented with Lagrangian particles that keep track of both the traveled distance (i.e. the arc-lengths of trajectories between start and end points on the two contours) as well as the point correspondences between A and B.</p><p>Tracker particles are first seeded on the zero-crossing of the interface. These particles are advected with an intermediate level set using Eq. (2). When the intermediate morph has reached a steady-state, we collect the length of the trajectories traveled by the particles. These distances are then signed (according to the inside/outside convention) and averaged to produce a signed distance estimate for the discrete zero-crossing grid points. A point-to-point correspondence between consecutive contours is also cached making intermediate morphs unnecessary between all contours at all timesteps.</p><p>The particle advection for a level set morph from φ A to φ B is implemented by repeating the following steps until a steadystate is reached, i.e. φ A = φ B :</p><p>1. Seed particles randomly on zero-crossing of φ A .</p><p>2. Advect the particles in the following vector field:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(φ B (x) − φ A (x)) ∇φ A (x)/|∇φ A (x)| 3. Propagate φA(x) with F = φB(x) − φA(x).</formula><p>4. Back-project particles into A using the vector field:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">−φA(x)∇φA(x)/|∇φA(x)| 5.</formula><p>Accumulate the distances traveled to the particles.</p><p>Step 1 to 4 are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>. The velocity fields are derived from the geometric interpretation of F (), the fact that the local normal field of φ A is ∇φ A (x)/|∇φ A (x)| and Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. We observe that the back projection step <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">4</ref>is necessary because discrete integration schemes for solving level set equations have a built-in numerical dispersion <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This essentially means Lagrangian particles will almost never follow the level set exactly. Hence the back projection is needed as a correction. The seeding of particles can be adaptive by dynamically adding or deleting particles as the particle densities changes during contour expansion or contraction. However, for the examples presented in this paper a simple over-sampling strategy with 10 initial particles per zero-crossing pixel proved sufficient. Note also that not all particles are guaranteed to reach a target contour. This corresponds to a situation where the particles are seeded on parts of a contour that erode away. It should be emphasized that this is a natural behavior and causes no problems for our subsequent reconstruction. Finally it should be stressed that the above procedure is repeated for each (CFL) timestep which implies that our approximate distance metric will converge to the correct distance as the sweeping level set approaches the input contours.</p><p>As a closing remark we note that even though our approach resembles the particle level set method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, they are very different. Our method is not designed to modify the level set interface in order to compensate for the numerical dispersion present in the integration scheme. Rather our particles are used for tracking and estimating distances between contours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">1D Interpolation For The Speed Functions</head><p>The approximation of the distances traveled by each contour during morphing is combined with the time-of-arrivals to produce smooth speed functions. Consider a sequence of morphs A → B → ... → N and a particular grid point on the zero-crossing of the current level set. Using the particle tracing technique described above we can estimate the associated signed distances, S i , that this part of the contour must travel to reach all the (past and future) contours with the time-ofarrivals, t i , where i = 1, 2, . . . , N . We then fit a smooth polynomial function through these discrete data points and differentiate it to get a speed-function at the considered grid point location. This 1D interpolation is repeated for the remaining zero-crossing grid points on the current level set.</p><p>Many differentiable functions can be used to fit the distances and times, using standard curve-fitting techniques. We have investigated several different polynomials, as well as shapepreserving measures. They include linear interpolation, cubic splines and monotonicity constraints. Simple linear interpolation for the speed-function will create a shape with straight lines connecting the corresponding points on the contours. If instead the aim is to make a smooth shape, a higher order polynomial is needed. One possibility is the natural cubic spline, which is a third order piecewise C 2 polynomial that minimizes strain energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Two reconstructions from the same input, one using linear interpolation and the other a natural cubic spline, are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref>.</p><p>Additional constraints can be applied to the cubic spline in order to control the properties of the reconstruction. If for example the shape is known or desired to be (piecewise) monotonic in time, it is possible to apply a monotonicity filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> to the splines. Such a filter imposes the constraint that the spline becomes piecewise monotonic with the potential loss of C 2 continuity. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6</ref> for an example. The field of constrained polynomials is vast and several, more complex, methods exist, which may be used to create reconstructions with a variety of shape properties. : Examples reconstructed with a natural cubic spline that produces the indicated overshooting (left) and monotonicity constraint spline (right). The inputs are three circular contours, a small one at the top and two equally large ones at the center and bottom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Velocity Extension and Renormalization</head><p>The velocities obtained by interpolation of the particle trajectories are only defined on the zero-crossing grid points. However, the speed-function of Eq. (1) must be defined in the full narrow band of φ. Therefore, to extend F() off of the interface we solve the following transport equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∂F(x, t) ∂t = S[φ(x, t)]∇F(x, t) • ∇φ(x(t), t)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">S[φ(x, t)] = φ(x, t) φ(x, t) 2 + |∇φ(x(t), t)| 2<label>(4)</label></formula><p>guarantees that information (i.e. the characteristics of Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">3</ref> The third order accurate TVD Runge-Kutta scheme described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> is used to accurately integrate these equations with appropriate CFL time steps. Godunov's scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> with a fifth order WENO upwind scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> is used for the numerical discretization in space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7">Closing the ends of the reconstructions</head><p>In order to complete the reconstruction the first and last contours must be closed off. One approach is simply to cap the ends with flat planes since no information is available (from the input) beyond the first and last contours. This is done in Figs. 5, 6 and 10. Another approach is to let extrapolation of the calculated speed-functions guide the morph until the surface closes. This approach is used in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7 and  9</ref>. The success of this approach of course depends on the employed interpolation scheme and the fact that the first and last contours are beginning to terminate (i.e. are shrinking). The user may manually specify additional external contours to form a cap. This is done in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8</ref>, where a top-most contour is added and the speed-function is constrained to produce a smooth result. Finally, these three approaches can of course be used in combination.</p></div>

Finally <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref> shows an artificial example of a reconstruction from three contour slices, one with two small circles, one with a square and one with a single large circle. Observe how the resulting morph accurately captures the sharp corners of the intermediate square as well as the changing topology.</p><p>All results presented in this paper were rendered using the standard mesh extraction technique of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The computational times on a 2.5GHz Macintosh G5 were 107 CPUseconds for Mt. Everest, 220 CPU-seconds for the mouse embryo, 240 CPU-seconds for the human torso and 1100 CPUseconds for the pelvis data set. It should also be stressed that none of the reconstructions required any user input other than the initial contours with associated time-of-arrivals. <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>: An artificial reconstruction with changing topology.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>We have presented a robust method for 3D reconstruction of closed surfaces from sparsely sampled parallel contours. Our method is based on a morphing process applied to neighboring contours that sweeps out a 3D surface as one contour morphs into the next. The morph is performed with an Eulerian formulation (i.e. fixed grid) augmented with Lagrangian particles (i.e. interface tracking). This is accomplished by propagating the input contours as 2D level sets with carefully constructed continuous speed functions. We utilize particle advection to estimate distances between the contours, monotonicity constrained spline interpolation to compute continuous speed functions without overshooting, and state-of-the-art numerical techniques for solving the level set equations. Our approach robustly reconstructs objects with complex branching structures, provides a superior technique for interpolating between sparse slices, and produces closed surfaces from contours with both smooth and sharp features. It addresses the previously overlooked, but crucial, problem of adjusting the local velocities of the morphing contours in order to guarantee smooth surface transitions at the contour boundaries.</p><p>Future work includes implementing user interaction techniques for processing datasets with non-overlapping contours, similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. This will allow the user to control the direction of the morph, thus offering an approach to applying expert knowledge about anatomically correct relationships between different segments of the reconstructed object. As described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> multiple non-aligned datasets may be generated from a single scanning session for a particular specimen. Our approach may be extended to create 3D surfaces from the contours of these non-uniform, arbitrarilyoriented, multiple datasets. Finally we plan to extend our level set method with the more efficient data structures and algorithms of <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> which will allow for reconstruction at extreme resolutions.</p></div>

S[φ] is essentially a smeared sign function of φ.Note that when F() is defined by velocity extension (Eq. (3)) the corresponding level set propagation is in fact norm conserving, i.e. renormalization is not needed to guarantee stability of the numerical scheme. This follows from,∂ ∂t |∇φ| 2 = 2∇φ•∇ ∂ ∂t φ = 2∇φ•(∇F |∇φ| + F ∇ |∇φ|) = 0(5) which makes use of the fact that φ is initialized as a Euclidian distance function (i.e. |∇φ| = 1 ⇒ ∇ |∇φ| = 0), and ∇φ • ∇F = 0, since Eq. (3) is solved to a steady state.When using Eq. (2) during advection of the Lagrangian tracker particles, the speed function is derived from closest distance transforms and therefore does not need to be extended. Consequently we must explicitly renormalize φ to a Euclidian distance function in order to ensure numerical stability of the morph. For this renormalization we solve∂φ(x, t) ∂t = S[φ(x, t)] (|∇φ(x, t)| − 1)(6)to a steady state. The sign function in Eq. (6) plays the same role as in Eq. (3).</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A A Fast Narrow Band Implementation</head><p>For optimal computational complexity we use a modified version of the narrow band scheme presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. It employs two dynamic tubes that enclose the level set interface; a T tube of width γ and an N tube that is one pixel wider than the T tube. We employ simple C-style arrays as defined in the following pseudo-code to implement efficient data structures for these tubes. This implies that the overall computational complexity of solving the level set equation is linear in the size of the interface and not of the embedding. To rebuild N and T after each time propagation we could apply the above algorithm again (as suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>), but this is inefficient since it visits all pixels. To maintain a linear computational complexity we instead use the following algorithm.</p></div>			</div>
