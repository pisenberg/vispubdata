<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ABSTRACT</head><p>Understanding and analyzing complex volumetrically varying data is a difficult problem. Many computational visualization techniques have had only limited success in succinctly portraying the structure of three-dimensional turbulent flow. Motivated by both the extensive history and success of illustration and photographic flow visualization techniques, we have developed a new interactive volume rendering and visualization system for flows and volumes that simulates and enhances traditional illustration, experimental advection, and photographic flow visualization techniques. Our system uses a combination of varying focal and contextual illustrative styles, new advanced two-dimensional transfer functions, enhanced Schlieren and shadowgraphy shaders, and novel oriented structure enhancement techniques to allow interactive visualization, exploration, and comparative analysis of scalar, vector, and time-varying volume datasets. Both traditional illustration techniques and photographic flow visualization techniques effectively reduce visual clutter by using compact oriented structure information to convey threedimensional structures. Therefore, a key to the effectiveness of our system is using one-dimensional (Schlieren and shadowgraphy) and two-dimensional (silhouette) oriented structural information to reduce visual clutter, while still providing enough three-dimensional structural information for the user's visual system to understand complex three-dimensional flow data. By combining these oriented feature visualization techniques with flexible transfer function controls, we can visualize scalar and vector data, allow comparative visualization of flow properties in a succinct, informative manner, and provide continuity for visualizing time-varying datasets. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Representing and understanding the complexities of threedimensional flow structures has been a problem of interest for centuries <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. The ability to understand and predict flow behavior affects our daily lives and safety through applications ranging from cardiology to aircraft design to global weather and climate predictions. Over the past century, many experimental visualization techniques have been developed to capture and depict flow properties. These methods range from photography (e.g., Schlieren photography, shadowgraphy) to dye injection, effectively capturing oriented flow gradients and communicating flow properties. Many of these techniques reduce detail and use lower-dimensional (e.g., 1D and 2D) structural information to depict flow features. Although these experimental techniques have produced some of the most stunning and scientifically meaningful flow imagery, they are expensive, time consuming, and not applicable to large scale problems. Unfortunately, computerized flow visualization techniques are still not as effective as traditional experimental visualizations. Over the past several centuries, artists and illustrators have also developed very informative representations of complex flow structures, allowing the clear depiction of fundamental flow properties and characteristics. One of the key features of these illustrations is the effective use of lower dimensional visual cues -silhouettes (oriented two-dimensional gradient information) -to succinctly show structural information.</p><p>Interestingly, both flow illustration techniques and experimental photographic flow visualization techniques use a common principle to effectively convey flow information: the display of selective lower-dimensional oriented feature information reduces the visual clutter of turbulent three-dimensional structures, while providing enough oriented structural information for the human visual system to reconstruct the three-dimensional flow.</p><p>Inspired by the commonalities and effectiveness of both traditional illustration and experimental photographic flow visualization methods, we have developed new effective, interactive, flow</p></div>

Our visualization system combines new advanced volume visualization, photographic, and illustration techniques to coherently and concisely depict flow features and directionality. We have developed new photographic volume rendering techniques, new illustrative style transfer functions, enhanced multivariate scalar and vector two-dimensional flow transfer function widgets, enhanced banding transfer function widgets, and expanded silhouette and boundary enhancement techniques that enable improved representation of structure orientation and reduction of confusing visual clutter. Our system can create flow sketches, traditional and enhanced Schlieren and shadowgraph effects, and improved experimental advection effects. By expanding the domain of two-dimensional transfer functions and feature enhancement to include multiple flow scalar and vector quantities, our system can interactively compute and depict important flow features and allows interactive comparative visualization for advanced flow analysis. Our system is also effective at highlighting important flow structures through the variation of rendering and shading techniques within the flow volume and can be applied to any three-dimensional scalar or vector dataset, creating new methods for oriented structure visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BACKGROUND</head><p>As computers have matured, numerical simulations have emerged as a viable means of modeling and predicting the behavior of complex flow phenomena. Computational methods for visualizing these flows have followed suit to provide a means for understanding and analyzing the results of these simulations. Early flow visualization methods provided powerful methods for querying the solutions, but only allowed very primitive graphical techniques, leaving the analyst to bridge the gap between the visual representation and the physics of the governing equations. Techniques for displaying contours, cutting planes, and isosurfaces gave analysts the first means for visually depicting three-dimensional volumetric flow. These methods, however, are often insufficient to display the complexity of important three-dimensional flow properties such as directionality, divergence, convergence, separation, boundary layers, vortices, wakes, and shocks.</p><p>Attempts to visualize these flow properties have led to the development of many additional visualization techniques: vector glyphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, line integral convolution (LIC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, texture advection (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>) and stream tracing (particle tracing, streamlines, and streaklines) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. For stream tracing, illumination, transparency <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and halos <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> have been added to help disambiguate the relationship of the complex thin stream lines. While many of these techniques are effective for two-dimensional flows, the density of their representation often severely limits their effectiveness for three-dimensional flows, particularly in viscous flows and those containing boundary layers. Even recent advancements to improve the clarity of these representations are not sufficient to clearly show the important flow structures (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>).</p><p>Methods focused on visualizing three-dimensional flow (e.g., volume visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>) have been unable to provide images that sharply focus on the features of interest, while still representing the three-dimensional structure. Recent work in volume flow visualization has also included multiple one-dimensional transfer function techniques for comparative visualization of multiple flow variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Our approach for flow illustration is based upon previous work in volume rendering algorithms with non-photorealistic (NPR) techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. Stompel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> have applied NPR techniques (e.g., stroke based rendering, silhouettes) to improve the understanding of flow volumes, showing the potential of applying volume illustration techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> to scalar flow volumes and streamlines. These volume illustration techniques have been recently extended to interactive rendering by utilizing the extended programmability of modern graphics hardware <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref> and rendering different zones of the volume in different styles <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Our illustration techniques have been applied to a wide variety of datasets to verify their broad applicability. The X38 dataset shows a single time step in the reentry process of the crew return vehicle into the atmosphere at a 30 degree angle of attack. The natural convection dataset simulates a non-Newtonian fluid in a box, heated from below, cooled from above, with a fixed linear temperature profile imposed on the side walls. The jet flow dataset contains 128 time steps from a simulation of unsteady flow emanating from a 2D rectangular slot jet, with the jet source located at the left. The Y-pipe dataset is a simulation of a pressure-driven flow of a non-Newtonian Powell-Eyring fluid in a branched pipe at a nominal Reynolds number of 20 and a viscosity ratio of 0.01. The tornado dataset is a computational simulation of a synthetic tornado. The cloud dataset is a microphysical cumulus cloud large-eddy simulation used to study drop formation processes and entrainment in cumulus cloud formations.</p><p>Our system utilizes new illustrative rendering, extended twodimensional transfer function widgets, illumination, boundary enhancement, and silhouette enhancement to create a variety of effective flow illustrations. The effect of these enhancements and transfer function widgets, the details of our new illustration flow styles, their physical basis and significance, and their relation to classical experimental flow techniques are described in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">ILLUSTRATIONS</head><p>Throughout history, illustrators and artists have developed a powerful set of techniques and visual metaphors to succinctly convey information. These techniques emphasize, modify, and subordinate information to the human visual system, including pattern and form (spatial information), color (light frequency), and motion (temporal information). The goal of the illustrator is to create a representation to convey information to the viewer, not recreate reality. Therefore, illustrators use lines, colors, patterns, and selective removal of detail to more effectively convey the essential information. Classic illustrations, such as the flow illustration in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> by Leonardo da Vinci <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, demonstrate the success of illustrations to convey the structure and motion of complex three-dimensional phenomena. This figure shows the reduction of detail in the flow and the use of silhouette sketching to provide enough oriented structural information to understand the flow without being confused by intricate turbulent flow details. Silhouette sketching effectively captures oriented structural information (two-dimensional) from the complex flow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Enhanced Flow Illustration Techniques</head><p>Our new system extends recent work in interactive volume illustration techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> to emulate these traditional flow illustration techniques and allows the specification of focus regions and context regions that are rendered with different styles and varying detail, similar to MagicSphere techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. As in traditional illustrations, this technique provides both attentive focus and context for orientation. Within the focus region, the rendering can show emphasis of information through boundary, silhouette, and transfer function enhancements and oriented shading cues through illumination models. Normally, the contextual regions are rendered in a "sketch" style, where only strong oriented features are rendered as sketch lines through silhouetting strong boundary regions and using almost constant shading. To assign different combinations of effects for different parts of the volume, the system can use these spatially varying, focus plus context regions in combination with transfer functions to assign styles based on voxel properties. These illustration techniques are effective for representing structure and oriented flow patterns, as can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1, 3</ref> In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>(a), the focus region is placed to highlight the bow shock and density waves present at the nose of the X38 spacecraft. Smooth transitions from the focus rendering to the context rendering provide a gradual blurring and softening of the flow structures along the body of the spacecraft. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>(b), the cores of the vortices are rendered more opaque and a stronger brown color is used to emphasize this data range, while the surrounding region is rendered "softer" by using a washed gray color with less opacity, providing subtle flow directionality context. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figures 3(a</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Extended Silhouette and Boundary Enhancement Domains</head><p>As previously mentioned, boundary and silhouette enhancements are effective techniques for conveying oriented structural information. We have adapted the traditional boundary and silhouette enhancement techniques to allow these calculations to be performed using a vector flow quantity or an additional scalar flow variable's gradient instead of the gradient of the flow quantity that is used for color and opacity rendering. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> shows the formulas for boundary and silhouette enhancement using the gradient of a scalar field and using a vector field for the enhancements. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows a comparison of boundary and silhouette-enhanced volume rendering (left) and contour-banded volume rendering (right) of the natural convection dataset in (a), a contour-banded volume rendering in (b), using the the gradient for boundary and silhouette enhacement in (c), using the velocity for silhouette enhancement in (d), and using the curl of the velocity field for silhouette enhancement in (e). <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>(c) more clearly shows the temperature variation and flow structure than (b) and reduces the visual clutter in the image, while (d) clearly shows the higher velocity flow regions. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> (e) shows the rotational centers of the convective flow, clearly highlighting the important structures representing the forcing functions in the simulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Extended Two-dimensional Transfer functions</head><p>Advanced two-dimensional transfer function widgets can be used to easily select portions of the flow to highlight and to create oriented patterns in smooth regions of the flow. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows our system interface with the focus region highlighted. The user can simply specify pre-defined style templates for both the focus region and context regions. Within each region, styles can also be specified for different portions of the flow (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figures 7(a)</ref> and (b) showing the rendering of a specific temperature region as a thin boundary volume and other temperature regions as sketches). These boundary, silhouette, shading, and two-dimensional transfer function effects can be interactively adjusted and rendered as the user explores the data through the use of fragment shaders, texture-based volume rendering <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and the latest generation of PC graphics boards. Twodimensional transfer functions allow us to easily perform boundary enhancement and use both the data and gradient range to determine opacity and apply illustration styles. We extended the interactive two-dimensional transfer functions of Kniss et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> in several ways. First, we added illustration style transfer functions to select spatial and data value regions for the application of different illustrative rendering styles. Second, we extended the domains of the two-dimensional transfer function widgets. Finally, we added a new banding transfer function widget. This banding widget uses a sine function to map the scalar data value to opacity, creating alternating low and high opacity contour volumes. Users can control the periodicity of the sine function and also apply a power function to create sharper or softer bands (e.g, sin 0.5 , sin 2 ). This contour banding was used to create most of the illustration and advection results in this paper and can also be used for Schlieren rendering. The combination of our banding transfer function and silhouetting allows us to create effective contour volumes with only oriented structural information, thus reducing visual clutter and overcoming many of the problems with texture advection and LIC techniques. The equation for the banding widget is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>We also extended the domain of the two-dimensional transfer function to allow several different values to be used as the second domain, including gradient magnitude (|∇U|), an additional scalar data variable (U 2 ), the Laplacian (∇ 2 U), |U| (U : vector data), and the curl (|∇ ×U|). These vector calculus operators were chosen because they are fundamental building blocks in constructing functions that are especially useful for analysis and flow visualization. The display of data computed from these operators can be interactively selected and manipulated using simple twodimensional transfer function widgets. The operators and techniques constructed from these operators are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. As compared to previous multivariate flow transfer functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, our work allows several variables and derived flow quantities to be combined into one two-dimensional transfer function widget so that any displayable attribute can be the selective product and enhancement of possibly different two-dimensional domains. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1, 4</ref>, and 6 show several examples of extracting important features and comparing flow variables using these multivariate two-dimensional transfer functions. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1(b)</ref>, shear stress and vorticity of the Y-pipe dataset are used in order to emphasize the interesting flow properties near the Y-junction, where backflow is introduced. This image uses a colored pencil rendering style. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>(a) more clearly visualizes the temperature flow by using the Laplacian to separate inflow, outflow and noflow regions. Heat inflow is color coded as red, heat outflow is color coded as blue and noflow regions are color coded as white. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>(b) uses the same color coding of the Laplacian to highlight velocity regions within the tornado dataset with the zero of the velocity magnitude Laplacian silhouetted, while the vortex core is rendered as an illuminated yellow isosurface. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>(c), turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), velocity, and the Laplacian of TKE are used to highlight the entrainment and mixing in the cloud. The velocity field of the cloud dataset is used to enhance the silhouette and boundary, while the zero values of the Laplacian are used to further enhance the boundaries, rendered in white. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6(d)</ref>, high second derivative magnitude regions of the temperature in the convection dataset are shown in colored bands, showing the origination of the convection poles that form as the flow heats and convects through the domain. Low magnitude regions are rendered in gray scale.</p><p>Our ability to render focus regions and context regions using different shading techniques and transfer functions enables global flow visualization and localized flow analysis. Different styles can also be separately applied to different data ranges within the focus and context regions. A key technique for reducing visual clutter is the silhouetting and boundary enhancement of contour volumes. Both illustrations and photographic flow visualization techniques successfully use similar oriented structure representations. For show- ing variation and orientation of data within relatively homogeneous regions, we utilize our banding transfer function widget to produce contour volumes. As compared to more traditional particle advection techniques, oriented contour volumes more effectively visualize converging and diverging flows and provide coherent animation of time varying flows, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figures 4, 6</ref>, and 7. As long as the scalar or vector volume data variable exhibits relative time coherence, these thin volume contours will provide a smooth animation of the time variation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">PHOTOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES</head><p>Our work is inspired by the effectiveness of both illustration and photographic experimental flow visualization techniques. Photographic flow visualization techniques have been used for over one hundred years to capture and allow analysis of three-dimensional flows. While illustrators use oriented silhouettes that capture two-dimensional gradient projections to reduce visual clutter in three-dimensional data, photographic flow techniques use one-  dimensional gradient variation to further reduce the visual clutter. Even though these techniques reduce the information to oriented one-dimensional variation, they are still effective at capturing enough important oriented flow information from complex threedimensional flows to allow the scientist to reconstruct the threedimensional flow structures and properties, as evidenced by their long successful use in experimental fluid dynamics. The two most commonly used flow photographic techniques are shadowgraphs and Schlieren photography <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. The Schlieren photographic process uses an optical system to capture density gradient variations in inhomogeneous media <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 8)</ref>. When illuminated with a parallel light source, the optical inhomogeneities refract the light rays in proportion to the gradients of the refractive index projected on the xy-plane, which is orthogonal to the light direction. This refraction produces a two-dimensional   <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">1)</ref>, and the Schlieren knifeedge apparatus is able to measure this displacement's projection in a specific one dimensional direction on the xy-plane, called the knifeedge angle, which is the main parameter of the process. Therefore, in classic Schlieren photographs, darker regions correspond to negative displacement, brighter regions correspond to positive displacement, and the knife-edge angle is usually chosen to provide the best visualization of particular features. Extensions of Schlieren techniques include using a circular cutoff that visualizes the displacement vector's magnitude, and color Schlieren photographs, that essentially create a "color-wheel" visualization of the displacement.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">|U| ∑ (U i ) 2 U = Scalar −→ AbsoluteValue U = Vector −→ VectorMagnitude ∇ •U ∂U ∂ x + ∂U ∂ y + ∂U ∂ z U = Scalar −→ Gradient U = Vector −→ Divergence U = ViewVector −→ Silhouette ∇ ×U ( ∂Uz ∂ y − ∂Uy ∂ z ) − → i + ( ∂Ux ∂ z − ∂Uz ∂ x ) − → j + ( ∂Uy ∂ x − ∂Ux ∂ y ) − → k Curl ∇ 2 ∂ 2 U ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 U ∂ y 2 + ∂ 2 U ∂ z 2 Laplacian dε (dε x , dε y ) Schlieren ∇ • ε ∂ εx ∂ x + ∂ εy ∂ y Shadowgraph (a) (b) (c) (d)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">ε = (ε x , ε y ) = k( z 1 z 0 ∂ ρ ∂ x dz, z 1 z 0 ∂ ρ ∂ y dz)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The shadowgraph observation setup is simpler, since it only contains a parallel light source and a screen <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Figure 9</ref>). Due to inho-mogeneities in the test area, refraction within the affected region displaces the light ray before it reaches the screen, changing the luminance distribution on the screen. Note that this luminance shift only occurs when the displacement vector ε along the x or y axes changes. Thus, the resulting luminance map value can be approximated by the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">L = z 1 z 0 ( ∂ ε x ∂ x + ∂ ε y ∂ y )dz = z 1 z 0 ( ∂ ρ 2 ∂ x 2 + ∂ ρ 2 ∂ y 2 )dz<label>(2)</label></formula><p>There have been several computer simulations of Schlieren photography of two-dimensional flows using image processing techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. For three-dimensional flows, the basic non-interactive simulations are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>; however, interactive Schlieren computer visualizations of three-dimensional flows have not been produced, although some commercial packages incorrectly refer to boundary enhancement as Schlieren results.</p><p>We have extended our texture-based volume rendering system to simulate and enhance the Schlieren and shadowgraph techniques. The Schlieren integral is calculated using two rendering passes. In the first pass, slice rendering performs the integration of the separate components of the displacement vector ε and stores them in the R and G components of a floating-point pixel buffer. Since the classic Schlieren setup places the light source directly behind the test area, we use front-to-back slicing to integrate along the light path. Note that this integral of positive and negative displacements allows them to cancel out their effects as in the experimental Schlieren system. For visualization of two-dimensional datasets and single slice visualization, only a single slice is rendered in this pass. The second pass transforms the displacement vector map to the actual image, scaling the resulting color by the sensitivity coefficient, s, according to the particular Schlieren method we want to simulate: knife-angle cutoff (Equation 3, where k is a normal to the knife edge), or circular cutoff (Equation 4).</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">I = s (1 + ( ε • k))<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">I = s| ε|<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The shadowgraph integral (Equation 2) is computed analogously, except that the value of L is scalar. Therefore, during the second rendering pass, the calculations simplify to the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">I = s (1 + L)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The most obvious and important limitation of the classic Schlieren photographic approach is that the experimental apparatus does not allow flexible control over which portion of the data is photographed: it always covers the entire test area, thus lacking the ability to focus on a particular location. There is active research in physics to extend the classic Schlieren approach and construct more complicated apparatuses to overcome these limitations. Our Schlieren renderer, however, allows us to easily filter the data according to the value or location, using regular transfer functions and distance-based transfer functions during the first pass, thus overcoming these obstacles and producing improved Schlieren images.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> shows an overview of all of the illustration and photographic techniques with the equations and physical relevance. All of the effects are implemented as fragment programs in our illustrative volume renderer, using Nvidia's Cg language. An example Cg shader for our Schlieren technique is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>. Our results were generated on a Pentium Xeon 3.20 Ghz workstation with 2.00 Gb RAM and a Nvidia GeForce 7800 GTX (256 Mb VRAM) graphics card. For interactive visualization (image size 350 × 350 pixels), we use a lower-quality mode (500 slices) and achieve approximately 20 fps for illustrative rendering and 30 fps for Schlieren rendering. Final quality images used in this paper were generated with the highest quality rendering settings (1000 slices) at 6-10 fps for illustrative rendering, depending on the complexity of the effects, and 15 fps for Schlieren rendering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>Initial feedback from domain scientists has been very positive. The visualizations produced from this system have allowed them to see aspects and behavior in the fluids that are not achievable using traditional visualization techniques. Rendering the convection dataset using the silhouette and boundary enhancement allows the scientists to easily separate the flow behavior and clearly shows the forcing function behind the simulation. Sketch and photography inspired visualization of the X38 dataset show properties of the flow that have never been shown before, allowing scientists to see the trip point on the body of the X38 causing the formation of strong vortices between the fins (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 13 (c)</ref>-(e) and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>In summary, our new visualization system addresses the need to improve computational visualization methods by taking advantage of the benefits of illustrations and experimental visualization methods. Both illustrations and experimental visualizations are adept at focusing the viewer's attention to specific facets of the display, while reducing visual clutter by placing emphasis on specific regions of interest and using oriented structures in the display to provide depth and three-dimensional structure. All of our illustrative, experimental, and photographic-based techniques are effective because they only use one-dimensional or two-dimensional oriented structural information and allow both spatially-varying (focus + context) and data-varying specification of rendering styles.</p><p>Our new system allows interactive visualization, exploration, and analysis of scalar, vector and time-varying volume datasets. We have successfully taken advantage of key methods from illustration by using oriented structural information and developing images that emulate scientific sketches and watercolors. We have also successfully emulated experimental flow visualization techniques by developing and demonstrating methods for producing enhanced Schlieren integral photographs and shadowgraphs on threedimensional scalar and vector volumes.</p><p>We plan to extend this work by providing more tools for visualizing time-varying datasets, larger and more varied grid structures, and fully developing the comparative visualization tools in our system. We also plan to optimize the interactive shader performance and more fully explore the use of these techniques to volumes generated from other domains.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1.</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Examples of oriented structural flow visualizations harnessing the effectiveness of illustrative and photographic flow techniques.
