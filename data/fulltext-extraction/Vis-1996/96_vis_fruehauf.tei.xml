				<p>Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) allows the holistic visualization of huge volumetric data sets in a single image. Computational Fluid Dynamics data is in principle well suited for DVR. But efficient mappings of the directional information of vector fields are still to be found. In this paper we investigate how the raycasting technique can be used to directly render vector fields. Our approach is based on the perception that other flow visualization techniques use visualization objects that are locally tangential to the vector field together with directed light sources. From this, we developed the idea to shade streamlines at sampling points when raycasting a vector field. We extended this approach further to more abstract mappings where pseudo-color is used. Combining opacity mapping, pseudo-color mapping, and streamline-shading we can express flow speed and flow direction together in one single image.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Beside medical imaging, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is the major source of very large volumetric data sets. Visualization of CFD data is challenging because of two reasons: First, the data is usually not computed on a regular, i.e., equi-distant and orthogonal, grid. More often, unstructured or curvilinear grids are used to adapt the grid efficiently to the flow domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Second, not one single type of data has to be handled in flow visualization. Instead, the computed data comprises scalar fields (e.g. pressure, temperature), vector fields (velocity), and in some cases even higher order tensor fields (e.g., turbulent stress). Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) allows the holistic visualization of volumetric data in one single image. This is accomplished by the use of a semi-transparent, light-transmitting material model. In contrast to other visualization techniques, in DVR volume primitives are not transformed into intermediate surface primitives.</p><p>DVR is an efficient alternative to polygonal isosurface extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> if the volume data does not contain huge gradients and if huge data sets have to be visualized where isosurfaces may consist of a very large number of polygons. Therefore, DVR is in principle well suited as a visualization technique for flow data. In the remainder of this section we review research and development for an efficient use of DVR in flow visualization.</p><p>The two main approaches for DVR are image space algorithms -also called raycasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> and object space algorithms -also called projection or splatting <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">23]</ref>. In both methods the object is traversed, either front-to-back or back-tofront, and pixel color is accumulated. In projection, object space coherence is exploited, by projecting complete voxel faces to the image plane. Therefore, this method is fast if the pixel size is substantially smaller than the size of one projected voxel. In raycasting, one or more rays per pixel traverse the object from the image plane, and color and opacity is sampled at discrete points or over "sampling volumes" <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Traditionally, projection was regarded to be faster, whereas raycasting should produce images of better quality. But in recent years, the "weak points" of both approaches have been improved.</p><p>To make use of DVR in other applications than medicine, projection as well as raycasting have been extended to nonregularly gridded volumes. When using projection for these types of grids, a major problem that has to be solved is how cell-order, with respect to the object's orientation to the user, is computed <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref>. Raycasting is also not generally restricted to regular grids. But sampling along the rays is extremely calculation-intensive if no special solutions are used, as they were developed for unstructured grids <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and for curvilinear grids <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>The second area of research -in order to make efficient use of DVR for flow visualization -is to develop methods to directly render vector fields. Often, only the scalar velocity magnitude, i.e., speed, is rendered. But this is generally not sufficient to provide insight into the structure of the flow field, except in cases of directed, interior flows. In the case of nondirected flows, the precomputation of the streamfunction f is more useful. Streamsurfaces are implicit surfaces , satisfying the condition . Since the local flow direction is always tangential to a streamsturface, the visualization of streamsurfaces gives a good impression of the flow field <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. But the streamfunction is a scalar value whose computation requires the definition of boundary values. Thus, the actual shape of streamsurfaces depends on the user's choice of these boundary values.</p><p>Sakas has used animation of raycasted density fields to visualize the flow of clouds and of fog <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Animation was also used by Crawfis and Max <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. They extended the spot noise technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> to 3D and combined it with a splatting algorithm. The local velocity vector determines the shape of their 3D texture splats. Therefore, in the case of stationary flow fields animation is not really</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">f x ( ) C = f u x ( ) ⋅ ∇ 0 =</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thomas Frühauf</head><p>Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Fraunhofer-IGD, Wilhelminenstr. 7, 64283 Darmstadt, Germany http://www.igd.fhg.de/www/igd-a4/, thfrueha@igd.fhg.de necessary, here. But the texture splats have a certain spatial extension like traditional "hedgehog" icons, so that they overlap and obscure each other. To resolve this, the authors used different splatopacities to emphasize only regions of high velocity.</p><p>Hong et al. rendered scalar fields and vector fields together via raycasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. This was accomplished by merging a scalar voxel volume with "voxelized" hedgehog icons that indicate local flow direction. However, this is not a truly volumetric visualization of the vector field as we understand it, but an icon based flow visualization in "voxel-graphics".</p><p>Uselton <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> describes a raycasting implementation where the velocity components v x , v y , v z where mapped to red, green, and blue, respectively, in the RGB color model. But this mapping usually leads to the accumulation of grey where local differences in the flow direction are hardly visible. Besides, such a visualizationeven if a non-grey color is accumulated -is difficult to analyze because the three colors have no "natural" relation to the cartesian directions.</p><p>The work described in this paper focuses on the raycasting of vector fields without a pre-computation of derived scalar fields.</p><p>In the following chapter we analyze how vector fields are perceived when other visualization techniques are applied. Based on this analysis, Chapter 3 presents a strategy to express local vector field direction in raycasting. In Chapter 4 we further develop this idea, which leads to an abstract expression of vector field direction. Different combinations of mappings are presented, showing how vector direction and vector magnitude can be visualized together. Finally, in Chapter 5 conclusions are drawn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PERCEPTION OF FLOW DIRECTION IN VECTOR FIELD VISUALIZATION</head><p>The starting point of our work is to analyze existing vector field visualization techniques with respect to the expression of vector field direction. From this analysis we want to identify a possible solution, how vector field direction can be expressed in raycasting.</p><p>• Hedgehogs are "arrow-icons" that point in the spatial direction of the vector field at discrete locations in 3D. But the 2D projection of the hedgehogs onto the screen is ambiguous. One solution to this problem is to change the viewpoint (in real-time or in playback) so that motion parallax overcomes this ambiguity. Another possibility is to use icons that are constructed out of several polygons to form a 3D object. Using directed light sources and a shading algorithm allows one to express the 3D orientation in a 2D image successfully.</p><p>• Streamlines are tangential lines in a vector field. Although they do not really have a "thickness", streamlines are often rendered as tubes or as ribbons, so that their real spatial orientation can be expressed through lighting and shading. But also motion parallax can be used with streamlines when they are displayed as lines.</p><p>• Streamsurfaces are, as explained above, isosurfaces of the streamfunction and are -as streamlines -tangential to the local vector field direction. Here, only directed lighting allows one to understand a streamsurface's shape, if it is drawn solid. Motion parallax alone succeeds only when the surface is drawn as a wireframe.</p><p>The three techniques mentioned above are not the only available tools to visualize vector fields, but they are the basic ones, on which others like particle tracing or vector field topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> build. All vector visualization techniques have in common the use of visualization objects that are locally tangential to the vector field. Viewpoint animation or shading can be used to express their 3D orientation successfully on a 2D display device. Viewpoint animation helps identify spatial orientation and shapes of objects. But it does not help to understand the flow direction if only the scalar velocity magnitude is rendered. On the other hand, animating the fluid motion itself can only succeed if separate material fluid-particles can be distinguished. In general, the main drawback of animations is the high computation times to produce several images. In the following we investigate how shading can be used in raycasting in order to visualize the whole vector field in one single image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">MAPPING OF VECTOR DIRECTION FOR RAYCASTING</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Streamline Shading</head><p>In raycasting we sample volume data at discrete locations along the rays. When raycasting a vector field, there is exactly one streamline crossing the viewing ray at each sampling point (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 1</ref>). We now want to shade the sample color according to the streamline's orientation relative to a directed light source. The problem here is that there is no single surface normal at a given point along the streamline (because it is a line and not a surface). But there is one plane to which the local velocity vector is normal. For shading, we now use that vector as "streamline-normal" s n , which points mostly towards the viewer while lying in this normal plane (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). The streamline-normal, s n , can be computed as:</p><p>With v n being the unit vector in the local flow direction. The distance h is computed as: Using a directed light source (see <ref type="figure">figure 3)</ref>, the shaded sample color c s is computed -for pure diffuse refection -from the sample color c by:</p><p>(3) <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. The samle lightness is determined by the light source's position relative to the sample streamline-normal.</p><p>Then, those samples where the flow is directed towards (or away from) the light source appear dark. Fluid samples, where the flow is directed normal to the light, appear brightest. Because of the view-dependency of streamline shading, the success of the proposed visualization technique depends on the careful positioning of the directed light. A good initial choice is to position the light according to the main flow direction v m (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 4)</ref>. This direction can be pre-computed simply as the average of all node-velocities weighted by the volume of the surrounding cells. Then, the image highlights so called "secondary flows", i.e., those areas where the local flow direction differes from the main flow direction. If the light source is located at the viewing position, the shading computation is simplified: For diffuse shading we do not need the vector s n itself, only the cosines of the angle between light direction l and the streamline-normal is required. As <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref> shows: ,</p><p>with β being the angle between flow direction v n and viewing direction e. From that, the shaded sample color c s is computed from the sample color c simply by:</p><p>Thus, flow towards or away from the viewer appears dark and flow normal to the viewing direction appears brightest. With the described technique we have realized an intuitive -but viewdependent -mapping of vector field direction.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Implementation and Results</head><p>Because we focus here on the mapping problem, it should be mentioned that we use the "homogeneous material model" described by <ref type="bibr">Wilhelms and van Gelder [20]</ref> and "alpha-blending" <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> in our implementation to compute the final pixel color from (shaded) sample colors and sample opacities. Some images in the color plate section show the results of the described implementation. We visualized the "vortex" data set (regular grid, 25x25x40 cells) that is the result of a finite difference simulation of a tornado. The flow field describes -tornado-like -a vertical vortex. Fluid flow at the bottom moves in a spiral towards the center, where it is lifted up. Still rotating, the flow diverges at the top of the data set. In figure 6 several different particle traces are shown together with their starting points. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Particle traces in the vortex data set shown for several different starting points. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows a raycasted image of velocity magnitude (with some semi-transparent isosurfaces). From the comparison of the particle traces and the speed distribution it is obvious, that DVR of speed is not sufficient to understand the characteristics of the vector field. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. Raycasting the scalar speed of the vortex data set -with semi-transparent iso-surfaces.</p><p>Raycasting the vector field as proposed in the previous section is shown on color plates 1 and 2 (see color section). Color plate 1 displays the effect of pure streamline-shading while additionally pseudo-color was used to map vector magnitude in color plate 2.</p><p>With "streamline-shading" we realized a mapping of local flow direction to sample lightness. However, the integrating nature of semi-transparent DVR leads -together with smooth variations of flow direction -to visualizations that are difficult to interpret if only a still image is used. The spatial orientation of the flow field is perceived much better if viewpoint animation is used instead of producing only single images 1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">AN ABSTRACT EXPRESSION OF VECTOR FIELD DIRECTION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">From Shading (Back) to Pseudo-Color</head><p>When pseudo-color is used additionally to express vector magnitude -as shown in color plate 2 -it is difficult to distinguish whether color differences in the image are caused from variations of vector magnitude or from variations of vector direction. Obviously the perception of hue alterations is easier than the perception of lightness changes. Therefore, it makes sense, to use pseudocolor to express vector field direction. As described in the introduction, this is not new in principle -but we do not map the cartesian components of the velocity vector to red, green and blue. Instead, pseudo-color is used here to enhance the visual effect that is produced with the proposed technique of streamline shading.</p><p>Recall, we used the cosines of the angle between the streamline normal and the light source for shading, i.e. to determine the sample lightness. We can map now the angle α itself to sample hue. This results in a visualization as shown in color plate 3: We used the physical spectrum from red (α = 0) to indigo (α = π/2) here. In this abstract visualization, we can see quite well where and how much the flow is directed towards or away from the light source, i.e., the viewing direction, here. In color plate 4 the light source is positioned according to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">fig. 4</ref>. against the main flow direction, i.e., vertically downwards. In all other images shown in the color section the light source is located at viewing position. In order to extract meaning from the data via DVR, it is necessary to adjust the transfer functions of the pseudo-color mapping efficiently. Therefore, a GUI for definition, storage, and retrieval of spline-based transfer functions has been implemented (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">figure  8)</ref>. Beside the individual splines for hue, lightness, saturation, and opacity, isosurfaces can be specified through vertical lines. Here, line length determines the isosurface opacity value. On top of the spline definition area a data histogram is displayed to support the user in adjusting the transfer functions. Although it is aimed to visualize the whole volumetric flow field successfully with one single image, viewpoint animations are often useful to help understanding volume-rendered data. However, since we are creating a view-dependent mapping here, special care has to be taken: Even if the directed light source is fixed relatively to the data set, different sample colors are computed for different viewing directions. This results from the dependency of s n from e (equ. 1). Therefore, in the case of view-point animations, we computed s n in all succeeding images with respect to the initial viewing direction. However, we have to keep in mind, that we give up the "physically based mapping", then.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Combination of Pseudo Color, Opacity, and Streamline-Shading</head><p>With opacity as an additional cue, we can now incorporate the vector magnitude (or any other scalar) into the visualizations. Several combinations of sample shading, color, and opacity mapping are possible, we show two of them:</p><p>• Color plate 5: High speed is mapped to high opacity values. A low, constant opacity value is used for low and medium speed values, whereas a high, constant opacity value is used for high speed areas. Velocity direction is mapped -through α -to color as in color plate 4.</p><p>• Color plate 6: Speed is mapped to sample color. Velocity direction is mapped -through α -to sample opacity. A low, constant opacity value is used for high and medium α values, whereas a high, constant opacity value is used for low α values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper we have described ways to use raycasting for the visualization of vector fields. We started with the analysis of other flow visualization techniques. They have in common the use of visualization objects that are locally tangential to the vector field. These objects are rendered in 3D, using lighting and shading. From this, we developed the idea to use lighting and shading to express flow direction when raycasting the vector field. We saw that pseudo-color can enhance the perception the flow direction. Therefore, we mapped the angle α -that was first computed for shading, i.e. to determine the sample lightness -to sample hue. With this approach the successful visualization of the vector field is possible. The combined use of pseudo-color, opacity and shading allows one to visualize both the local flow direction and the local flow speed. One of the benefits of the proposed technique is the simple integration into existing scalar-field-raycasting modules. View-dependent mapping and the use of pseudo-color for the visualization of vector field direction is something to which the user first has to become accustomed to. However, we cannot expect vector field raycasting to be successful if the same metaphors as in scalar field raycasting are used.</p><p>The computational effort for each sample is higher in vector field raycasting (CP 1 to 6) than in scalar field raycasting <ref type="figure">(Fig. 7)</ref> 1 . The additional costs are caused by trilinear interpolation of a vector instead of a scalar at sample points -which is significant -and from the shading calculation -which is less significant. However, the rendering times for the images that are presented in this paper have all been less than ten seconds 2 on a four-processor SGI-Onyx. This demonstrates the practicality of this approach.  <ref type="figure">fig. 7</ref> to prevent the missing of isosurfaces. Pure semi-transparent raycasting does not require this small sampling distance. 2.
