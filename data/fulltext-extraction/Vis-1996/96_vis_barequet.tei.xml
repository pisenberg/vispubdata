				<p>We introduce an algorithm for reconstructing a solid model given a series of planar cross-sections. The main contribution of this work is the use of knowledge obtained during the interpolation of neighboring layers while attempting to interpolate a particular layer. This knowledge is used to reconstruct a surface in which consecutive layers are connected smoothly. In most previous work, each layer is interpolated independently of what happened or will happen in the other layers. We also discuss various objective functions which aim to optimize the reconstruction, and present an evaluation of the different objective functions by using various criteria.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The reconstruction of an object from a series of cross-sections has been an intriguing problem during the last couple of decades. Main motivations for this problem come from applications such as medical imaging, digitization of objects, and GIS systems. Data obtained by CT or MRI apparata, range sensors, or elevation contours, can be interpolated in order to represent and visualize human organs, CAD objects, or topographic terrains. This problem has been explored in two major directions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>: reconstruction of contiguous 3D data sets and reconstruction of an imaginary approximating surface.</p><p>Contiguous 3D data set reconstruction methods are inspired by image processing techniques and treat the data as a 3D image obtained by piling up the images of the cross-sections. Either interpolation (linear, bilinear, trilinear, non-linear or shaped-based) or slice replication are used to fill in the gaps between slices (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>). The advantages of these methods are their simplicity and their suitability for volume rendering (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>). The drawbacks of these methods are the large data storage required and the computational cost and delay associated with the recalculation of the viewing space.</p><p>Polyhedral methods interpolate the missing data between slices by constructing an imaginary approximating surface. It is assumed that each slice is given as a set of polygonal contours that delimit the material regions. These methods result in significant reduction in data storage and can exploit existing software for fast manipulation and display. They allow the user to quickly examine many different viewing spaces. The major drawback of this strategy is the use of a thresholding scheme. In this paper we deal with a surface-based algorithm.</p><p>Many algorithms for polyhedral interpolation were suggested in the past (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>). Many of them fail for complex structures (e.g., branching) and leave gaps between the contours. Some of them try to reduce more involved cases to the simple 1-to-1 case (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>). There have been a few attempts to handle the interpolation problem in full generality, without limiting the number of contours in the slices, their geometries, or their containment hierarchies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>).</p><p>A practical simplification of the reconstruction problem, assumed in most of the previous work, is to consider only a single pair of successive parallel slices, and to interpolate a solid model within the layer delimited by these slices. The concatenation of these models is the solution of the full problem. However, the assumption that the layers are independent on each other is not necessarily realistic, and may result in an object whose boundary makes sharp turns in the transition from one layer to the neighboring layer. We are not aware of any polyhedral interpolation method which handles the interpolation in a given layer while considering the interpolations in adjacent layers.</p><p>In this work we attempt to avoid this simplification. We base our algorithm on the one presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> for interpolating between two successive slices and extend it so that it incorporates data from neighboring layers. This extension considerably improves the quality of the surface without increasing the running time of the algorithm. The algorithm does not make any assumption about the input and handles all branching situations. In addition, it does not leave gaps between contours. In a nutshell, the algorithm is composed of two steps. The first step matches similar contour portions between every pair of adjacent slices and tiles each pair of matched contour portions by a sequence of adjacent triangles. Then, the remaining clefts between contours (3-dimensional polygons that consist of unmatched portions of contours) are filled by triangulation. See more details in Section 2.</p><p>Since the first step of the algorithm matches similar portions of the contours, we expect that the resulting interpolation of this step will look smooth. The second step (cleft triangulation), however, matches the non-similar parts of the contours. The resulting interpolation may therefore exhibit abrupt changes. It is thus the triangulation step that we aim to improve. This paper focuses on cleft triangulation.</p><p>First, we introduce a new approach for considering the interpolations of adjacent layers while triangulating the clefts of the current layer. We denote it the history consideration. Our experiments show that information produced by the already interpolated surface patches in the vicinity of the cleft can be used to efficiently generate triangulations that appear to connect smoothly with the vicinities of the clefts.</p><p>Second, we study various objective functions for cleft triangulation, and compare the quality of the resulting triangulations by using various measures. We note, however, that there is no unique solution to the interpolation problem, and that a measure of 'goodness' of a proposed solution is rather subjective and intuitive.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the algorithm and in particular the method of considering the history of interpolation in the triangulation of clefts. In Section 3 we present several objective functions for optimizing a triangulation of a cleft and a comparison between them. We present some experimental results in Section 4. We conclude in Section 5. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">THE ALGORITHM</head><p>In this section we present our interpolation algorithm. We first describe the basic algorithm which is based on that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. We then discuss how we use history during the process of interpolation. That is, how data gathered from the portions of the object that have already been interpolated influence the further surface reconstruction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The Basic Algorithm</head><p>The algorithm consists of two steps: contour matching and tiling and cleft triangulation.</p><p>The first step matches similar contour portions of the two slices and tiles each pair of matched contour portions by a sequence of adjacent triangles. Matching similar contour portions is performed by using a partial curve matching technique, which was first suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. This technique uses the Geometric Hashing method. The edges of the contours are first discretized. Each vertex is attributed by a footprint which is invariant under projection (of one slice onto the other). In our case the footprint is the xy-coordinates of the vertex. Finally, pairs of vertices, one at each slice, with sufficiently close footprints (i.e., vertices which are geometrically close) are located. A voting scheme is used for computing the alignment of contours which makes sufficiently large portions of them fit. Two subsequences, one of each contour, are said to match each other, if, for some chosen parameter " &gt; 0 , there are sufficiently many pairs of vertices at the same relative locations along the subsequences, such that the differences between the corresponding footprints do not exceed ". Each pair of matched contour portions is tiled by a sequence of adjacent triangles which form a 'band' between the portions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows a tiling between "similar" portions of contours.</p><p>Now, the union of the original polygons and new triangles is considered and duplicate edges are canceled out. The result is a collection of closed spatial polygons, so-called clefts, which are composed of pieces of polygons of both slices and of edges of the connecting triangles. The matching procedure guarantees that the xy-projections of the clefts are pairwise disjoint (although they may be nested within each other). Then, the clefts are triangulated so that some function (e.g., total area) of the triangulation is optimized. A dynamic-programming approach is used in the triangulation step. If nesting occurs, the containment hierarchy is first simplified by adding bridges (pairs of oppositely oriented segments) between the clefts, using a minimum spanning tree heuristic. These bridges do not conflict with the geometries of the clefts since their xy-projections are pairwise disjoint.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">History Consideration</head><p>The basic algorithm can be applied to each level separately. Our goal, however, is to interpolate the current layer "consistently" with the way its neighboring layers have been interpolated. Here "consistent" means that we attempt to avoid the creation of sharp dihedral angles between triangles of the interpolated surface. We proceed in two phases. We first invoke the tiling phase for all the layers, and only then perform the triangulation of all the remaining clefts (in all the layers). Recall that in the basic algorithm each layer was interpolated separately by invoking these two steps for each layer. While the performance is not affected, the above modification allows us to use information gathered previously in order to improve the quality of cleft triangulations. Improving the outcome of cleft triangulation is of major concern, since this is where nonsimilar parts of the layers are being interpolated. We are able to employ not only the data produced during the tiling phase, but also the the data created during the cleft triangulation of previous levels (since triangulation is done in an ascending order of the layers).</p><p>In order to perform a history-guided cleft triangulation we maintain the normals of the created triangles (generated either during tiling or during previous triangulations). Each of the three edges of an existing triangle is associated with the triangle's normal. We consider it as a "recommendation" for the normals of the adjacent triangles we are about to build. Now, when we attempt to triangulate a particular cleft, some of its edges may already have a "recommended" direction, while others may not. If none of the edges of a candidate triangle is attributed with such recommendation, the triangle receives the weight of the particular objective function we try to optimize (e.g., minimum area). However, if some of the edges are associated with recommendations of normal directions, then the weight of the candidate triangle is also affected by the direction of its normal. A triangle receives a smaller (i.e., better) weight if the direction of its normal is more consistent with the "recommended" direction (that is, the angle between them is small). To find the weight of a candidate triangle, its weight without the consistency consideration is multiplied by a factor which is a function of the angle between the recommended normal and the actual normal. In case more than one edge is attributed with a previous normal vector, the average of these directions is considered. Thus we favor triangles whose normals agree with the directions of their neighboring triangles. Full consistency (resp. inconsistency) occurs when the angle is 0 o (resp. 2 . This function was chosen so that it would favor small angles. Moreover, it gives a much higher "bonus" to small angles (deviations between normals), since it decreases in non-linear rate. (In particular, we selected the parabola that satisfies the constraints f 0 = 0, f 2 = 6 , and f = 1 0 .) We experimented with various functions and found that this function works very well in practice.</p><p>To illustrate how knowledge of already-interpolated pieces of the surface helps in preventing conflicts (sharp angles) with the newly interpolated portions, consider the following synthetic example. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>(a) (see color plates) shows a cleft which is about to be triangulated. The same cleft appears in two different contexts. Each context results in a different cleft triangulation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 3(b,c)</ref> show the two triangulations of the cleft, while <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 3(d,e)</ref> show the environments of these triangulations. The reconstructions of the neighboring layers are shown in blue, the matches of the current (middle) layer are shown in green, and the cleft triangulations are shown in red. Note that completely different cleft triangulations were reconstructed so that they would connect smoothly with their neighborhoods.</p><p>In Section 4 we demonstrate how our algorithm works on real data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">HEURISTICS FOR 3D POLYGONAL TRI-ANGULATION</head><p>Theoretically, a cleft may not have any non-self-intersecting triangulation. It was shown recently in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> that the decision problem of whether a 3D polygon is triangulable is N P -complete. However, a 3D polygon with a simple xy-projection (which is our case) is always triangulable. We use a dynamic programming approach for cleft triangulation. This technique optimizes the given objective function, but does not guarantee that non-self-intersecting solutions are found. In practice, however, dynamic programming works extremely well. It produced non-self-intersecting triangulations for all the clefts we experimented with.</p><p>We define four objective functions to be optimized (i.e., minimized). Each function is a mapping of every triangle to some positive real number. Each triangulation of an n-gon consists of exactly n 2 triangles and n 3 internal edges, so we measure in all cases the total sum of the function over the triangulation and omit the average. The description of the objective functions follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Area. This objective function obtains a minimum-area trian-</head><p>gulation. The intuition behind choosing this function is that we expect a non-intersecting triangulation of a 3D polygon with a simple xy-projection to have a small area.</p><p>2. Area 2 . This function prefers more substantially small triangles over large ones. This is so because large triangles are "punished" more severely than in the previous measure, since the growth in their weight is squared. This function has two advantages over the previous function. It is computed more efficiently and it favors regular triangulations over nonregular triangulations. Regular triangulations contain triangles of similar areas. Its drawback is that it does not necessarily yield the minimum-area triangulation.  There exists no single criterion for measuring the quality of a triangulation, and thus of the quality of the reconstructed surface. A good triangulation should not intersect itself, but it should also be smooth, for certain applications it should not contain long skinny triangles, it should avoid "waves", etc. We compare the above objective functions by using the following criteria.</p><p>1. Area. The sum of the areas of all the triangles. It measures the total surface area of the particular triangulation. Often, a minimum-surface triangulation is considered the "best" guess of an unknown surface spanned by an input three-dimensional polygon.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Number of inversions.</head><p>A triangle forms an inversion when two of its edges are internal to the triangulation and the dihedral angle of one of them is more than whereas that of the other edge is less than . It measures the degree to which the surface is rippled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Number of intersections.</head><p>The number of intersections of triangles in the triangulation. Self intersecting surfaces are unacceptable for most applications. Thus it measures the validity of the triangulation. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> summarizes our findings for a sample of six threedimensional polygons. It demonstrates the tradeoffs between the various objective functions. The chosen polygons were produced during the reconstruction of a pair of human lungs. They are typical to the kind of polygons produced in the course of this interpolation algorithm. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows three of these polygons; the axis-parallel bounding boxes were included in order to demonstrate the nonplanarity of the polygons.</p><p>To minimize the area, the natural objective function is minimum area. However, area 2 and area 2 +length produce small areas as well. In fact, area 2 +length works better (in the examples that we tested) than area 2 and almost as good as minimum area. This is a pleasant result since area 2 +length also avoids long skinny triangles.</p><p>The average dihedral angle indicates the "smoothness" of the surface. We expect a surface of small area to be as flat as possible. The objective function that appears to be the best in this regard is minimum area. The objective functions area 2 and area 2 +length also do well because they take into account the area of a triangle. In fact, in a couple of cases, area 2 +length is slightly better than minimum area. The function minimum angle lags behind the other functions. This is anticipated since the regularity of the triangulation seems to be unrelated to its smoothness.</p><p>The average ratio of edges and its maximum point to the existence of long skinny triangles. The objective function minimum angle is the best in this regard. This is not surprising since the goal of this function is to avoid these undesired triangles. The objective function area 2 +length also produces nice results due to its edgelength component. Both minimum area and area 2 may create (as observed in our experiments) undesired thin triangles both on average and in the worst case.</p><p>The number of inversions indicates the "rippleness" of the surface. We found no consistency in the results. For example, minimum angle is the best for the 14-gon and the worst for the 37-gon. One possible explanation for the inconsistency of the results is that natural data are typically wavy. The objective functions minimum area and area 2 +length perform reasonably well in all cases.</p><p>Finally, no self-intersecting triangulations were generated in any of the examples we experimented with. This may be so because our algorithm guarantees that the xy-projections of the 3D polygons are always simple, therefore triangulable. Note that theoretically it is not guaranteed that our algorithm always finds a non-selfintersecting triangulation.</p><p>Our conclusion is that area 2 +length is the objective function of choice. Although it does not optimize any of the criteria we checked, it exhibits a good behavior for all of them and in most cases it is almost optimal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">IMPLEMENTATION AND EXPERIMEN-TAL RESULTS</head><p>The algorithm was implemented in C on a Silicon Graphics workstation. To guide our search for good heuristics, and to visualize the results, we used the geometric animation system GASP <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and the visualization package Geomview <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. We reconstructed several human organs, among them a heart, lungs, and pelvis. <ref type="figure">Figures 6(a,b)</ref> show a human heart.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper has investigated a novel method for interpolating polygonal slices while considering the interpolation of adjacent layers. The algorithm consists of two major steps. First, similar contour portions of every consecutive pair of slices are matched and tiled. We are then left with three-dimensional polygons, so-called clefts. The clefts are triangulated "consistently" with the interpolations in the neighboring layers. We have demonstrated how different environments of the same cleft generate completely different triangulations, which match their neighborhoods.</p><p>We have also addressed in this paper the issue of optimization functions for cleft triangulations. We implemented several optimization functions: minimum area, minimum square of area, minimum square of area + the lengths of the edges, and minimum angle. We evaluated the "goodness" of each of the above heuristics by various criteria, and provided experimental results. We concluded that in most cases the minimum square of area + the lengths of the edges should be the method of choice.</p><p>Our algorithm has been implemented and used for the reconstruction of several human organs, among them a human heart, lungs, and pelvis. It works very well in practice, even for completely different slices with various branching situations, and produces relatively smooth boundaries.</p><p>It remains to be seen if more complex variants of optimization functions can produce significantly better interpolations. Also, an interesting question is whether there exists an optimization function that guarantees a non-self-intersecting cleft triangulation in case the cleft has a simple xy-projection.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Tiling similar portions of contours</figDesc></figure>
