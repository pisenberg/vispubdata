In this setup, a SGI RealityStation acts like a remote rendering system which is controlled by a user interface that was added to an existing clinical system. This paper describes some implementation aspects, including several system optimizations that were carried out in order to optimize rendering speed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Volume rendering is often used for the visualization of blood vessels from Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) data. Display of 3D MR angiograms poses a problem in that the volume data is often too noisy to calculate satisfactory 3D images using traditional 3D reconstructions based on extraction and shading of surfaces. Therefore, in a clinical setting, Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) is usually the method of choice; with this ray casting technique, the maximum greyvalue encountered along each ray is assigned to the corresponding pixel in the output image. Since MIP requires the evaluation of all sample points along each ray, it is computationally expensive; MIPs are therefore typically calculated in batch mode by the MR scanner (where each MIP typically requires one minute) and stored with the original MRA slices. MIPs are then usually statically viewed, which requires a considerable amount of anatomical expertise of the clinician since MIP presents an inconsistent spatial perspective to the user.</p><p>Algorithmic improvements can reduce image generation times to several seconds <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, but such an approach requires a lengthy preprocessing step and is still not fast enough for interactive visualization. Real-time exploration of MRA datasets is only possible using parallel systems or special purpose hardware. Because of the costs of these systems, they are not yet attractive for developers of medical workstations. As a result, no commercial (or even experimental) system currently allows for interactive exploration of MRA volume datasets in a routine clinical setting.</p><p>This case study describes work that was aimed at providing our clinical colleagues with state-of-the-art interactive visualization of MRA datasets using a Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) RealityStation system. The organization of the paper is as follows. We first briefly explain the texture mapping rendering algorithms used by such systems and describes various system optimizations that were carried out in order to optimize rendering speed. We then describe our current setup, which consists of a graphics workstation that is controlled by a clinical workstation; communication between the systems is done via Ethernet. We present three clinical cases that were diagnosed using our setup, after which we summarize the main findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Texture mapped volume rendering</head><p>Three-dimensional texture mapping hardware as found in SGI's Re-alityStation allows for interactive volume visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The basic approach is simple; instead of compositing individual samples along rays, entire planes of pixels are composited in parallel. The individual pixel planes, parallel to the screen, are reconstructed by trilinear interpolation of the original volume data using the texture mapping hardware. Each plane is then passed through a lookup table that maps the intensity value onto color and opacity values (RGBA mapping). Finally, the RGBA values that correspond to each pixel plane are composited into an output image in a back-tofront order fashion.</p><p>The primary performance factor with this approach is the number of trilinear interpolations (trips). In practice, the number of trips required for a high-quality stereo rendering of a scene is 4 to 16 times higher than the number of voxels in the dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>; clinical datasets, typically 2 to 50 Mvoxels, therefore require 32 to 200 Mtrips per rendering. Since our system has one raster manager that can only provide 40 Mtrips, we had to implement two speedup techniques in order to obtain adequate rendering speeds.</p><p>First, the clinician can use three pairs of clipping planes to interactively cut away uninteresting parts of the volume. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1a</ref> shows a rendering of a typical MRA dataset of 100 slices of 256256; the dimensions of the volume are indicated by a bounding box. A major part of the volume is not interesting; we therefore can use clipping planes to cut away uninteresting parts of the volume. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1b and 1c</ref> contain two examples of clipping planes.</p><p>In our implementation, the clinician uses pairs of clipping planes with orientations that coincide with the three major orientations in the human body's coordinate system (sagittal, coronal and transversal). The distance between the pair of clipping planes as well as their position is adjustable using sliders; radio buttons determine which pair of clipping planes is active.</p><p>With this setup, it only takes a few seconds to interactively cut away the uninteresting parts of the volume. Because rendering speed is linear with the number of voxels displayed, we usually obtain a two to five-fold improvement in rendering speed.</p><p>We also apply successive refinement; during the exploratory phase the volume is rendered at half the size (in each dimension) and then zoomed up to the full rendering window size. A high resolution image of the scene is generated as soon the user stops changing the viewing angle. Combination of the two techniques gives a four-to twenty-fold improvement in rendering speed during manipulation of the volume data, and provides high-resolution images for inspection at fixed viewing directions. 3 System description</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Introduction</head><p>Key requirements for clinical use of interactive volume visualization are</p><p>Adequate rendering speed (addressed in the previous section); A graphical user interface (GUI) aimed at clinical users; A short learning curve, so that clinicians can almost immediately use the new functionality. To satisfy these requirements, new systems have to be compatible with the clinical working environment of the department, which mainly uses Sun-based EasyVision systems of Philips Medical Systems (PMS). PMS provided us with an EasyScil development environment that allowed us to add our own software to a clinical system. We therefore decided to use two workstations for our setup: an EasyVision system that provides the GUI of the volume rendering software and an SGI RealityStation that performs the actual renderings (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2)</ref>.</p><p>Communication between the two systems is done via a TCP/IP connection via Ethernet; after downloading the volume data to the SGI system, all manipulations via the EasyVision GUI are translated to ASCII command strings that are immediately sent to the RealityStation. In the clinical setup, the RealityStation behaves like a remote rendering system that is only active during volume visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The EasyScil system</head><p>EasyScil is the integration of two programs: EasyVision CT/MR and ScilImage. EasyVision CT/MR provides features such as viewing, storing and printing of medical images and tools for database management, segmentation, registration and visualization as well as a good looking GUI. The integrated EasyScil environment provides a user interface editor, dynamic linking and various libraries for image processing.</p><p>The GUI for the volume rendering system was built using the GUI-builder which produces a GUI with the same look-and-feel as the standard EasyVision product, thus facilitating a seamless integration within the clinical system (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3)</ref>. Events that are generated by the individual controls of the GUI are handled by a straightforward piece of C code that generates a simple ASCII command, which is then forwarded to the rendering system.</p><p>The data to be rendered is selected using database facilities of the EasyVision system; this provides the clinician with a familiar tool. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">The RealityStation software</head><p>We based our software on SGI's proof-of-concept program volren that is available on the Internet in source code. Although this program was virtually undocumented, it was reasonably well structured. The extensive use of IrisGL/OpenGL and X libraries proved useful for understanding and modification of the program.</p><p>After analyzing the main structure of the package, we removed undesired parts from the program and added new functionality:</p><p>Since the EasyScil environment provides the GUI, all GUI related code was removed from the volren program. In the final system, only the rendering window is visible on the remote rendering system; Functions that were deemed less relevant for clinical use were also disabled (such as plane loop, generation of surfaces, and vector mode);</p><p>The I/O part of the program was replaced by code that obtains volume data and rendering commands from a Unix TCP/IP socket;</p><p>A "smart" buffering scheme was added to the TCP/IP input buffer to remove unprocessed rendering commands that are  overruled later (e.g., sliders on the EasyScil station will generate a series of rendering commands, but the majority of the commands will be discarded since only the most recent viewing direction is relevant);</p><p>The interface for control of the clipping planes was rewritten; To optimize rendering speed, a low-resolution monitor setting was enforced for both standard and stereo viewing. The 512512 output window fills the complete screen, which proves very convenient.</p><p>The resulting program is automatically started upon startup of the SGI system; it subsequently waits for a socket connection with the EasyScil system. After a connection is accomplished, it subsequently parses incoming instructions.</p><p>Note that in the present setup the communication between EasyScil and SGI Onyx is unidirectional. To allow for a fast introduction of our system in the clinic, we decided on a simple implementation and add two-way communication later. Since clinicians already asked for the ability of storing generated volume renderings together with the associated rendering parameters, we definitely have to write additional software that would provide these features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Examples of clinical applications</head><p>The system has been clinically used for approximately three months at the time of writing; initial clinical results are very encouraging. While we considered the system only suitable for MRA visualization, it also proved useful for Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>-6 contain three examples of clinical findings using the system. The first case <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4)</ref> is a 50 year old woman who underwent MRA imaging of the renal arteries to screen for renal artery stenosis, a constriction of the vessel that could be the cause of her hypertension. The right renal artery was well visualized on the MIPs that were routinely reconstructed and no stenosis could be detected. The left renal artery, however, was obscured by an overlapping vascular structure. Only after time consuming reconstruction of additional projections, the left renal artery could be visualized and did not show stenosis. The origin of the overlapping vasculature was still not clear. With interactive volume rendering and stereo viewing it was apparent that the vasculature was a very tortuous splenic artery representing a variant of normal anatomy. Finding the optimal view for diagnosis of the renal arteries proved to be very easy as well.</p><p>The second case ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>) is a 73 year old woman suffering from subarachnoideal (cerebral) bleeding who underwent angiography and MR-angiography examinations. Using standard viewing procedures, which presents 2D and 3D images on film, no abnormalities were diagnosed when reviewed by several experienced clinicians. The MRA study of this patient was loaded during the initial test phase of our system in order to demonstrate its features; a resident then diagnosed an aneurysm (dilation) of the left medial cerebral artery, not aware of the clinical background of this specific patient. Thanks to the interactive rendering speeds of the system, this very small aneurysm was located and diagnosed within a minute. With retrospective viewing of the angiography films, this aneurysm was indeed -but hardly-visible. This "accident" convinced our clinicians of the added value of interactive 3D viewing. For diagnosis of MR angiography, our system is therefore gradually becoming an addition to standard viewing procedures.</p><p>The last example concerns a 55 year old woman with a history of aortic valve surgery and replacement of the aortic arch. She was referred to our department for CTA to assess the present situation. On the conventional traverse slices an aneurysm of the aortic arch was diagnosed. The thoracic surgeons wanted to be informed about the three dimensional anatomy, which is extremely difficult to derive from a set of traverse slices in cases like this. Especially the relation with side branches, exact place and extent of the aneurysm was very important for surgical planning. For conventional 3D visualization, using shaded surface display, segmentation of the volume of interest is required. This segmentation is labour-intensive and highly operator dependent, which could result in loss of diagnostic information. In this case, the segmentation took 35 minutes and calcifications in the vessel wall were not shown. Our system provided volume renderings at interactive rates and provided the surgeons with the comprehensive three dimensional information they needed. Stereo viewing proved very helpful in providing a better insight in the complex anatomy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>Achievement of adequate rendering speed is essential for clinical use; we resorted to successive refinement and clipping planes to achieve acceptable frame rates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="00000">11111 11111</head><p>Aneurysm 000000000 000000000 111111111 111111111 While this clinical setup is essentially very simple, this is probably one of the first systems that is used for routine clinical use of interactive 3D manipulation of volume data. After some initial skepticism, the overall response of the clinical users has been surprisingly positive; the interactive speeds allows them to find optimum viewing angles for complex vascular structures and to choose rendering parameters in an interactive fashion. Moreover, the laborious segmentation step is usually not required for the display of vascular structures, thus reducing the time required for clinical diagnosis.</p><p>Clinicians often use stereo viewing (provided by StereoGraphics' CrystalEyes 3D LCD shutter glasses). While they liked the improved depth cues, they complained about the serious flicker from the GUI console (the CrystalEyes are synchronized to the SGI display, which has a different update frequency compared to the EasyVision console). In addition, the current GUI seems not very suited for direct 3D interaction. We therefore consider to move towards head-coupled perspective since real-time rotation also provides a more important depth cue than stereo <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Unfortunately, structured motion requires a minimum of ten frames per second, which is too computationally demanding for the present system. Present high-end systems as SGI's InfiniteReality can deliver up to 800 Mtrips, which should be sufficient to achieve such frame rates even with large datasets.</p><p>Our experimental setup really served as an "eye opener" for many clinicians at our hospital; they are now much more aware of the possibilities that modern hardware offers for interactive volume visualization. They consider our simple setup as a glimpse of their future: once systems like ours become common, they will have a major impact on medicine, especially in areas as radiology, treatment planning and image guided intervention.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Use of clipping planes to improve rendering speed.
