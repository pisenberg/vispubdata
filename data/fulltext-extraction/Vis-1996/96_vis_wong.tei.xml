				<p>Brushing is a data visualization technique that identifies and highlights data subsets. We introduce a form of brushing in which the brushed data is usually displayed at a different resolution than the non-brushed data. This paper presents the rationale behind the multiresolution support of multivariate data visualization and describes the construction of multiresolution brushing using wavelet approximations. The idea is implemented in an enhanced version of Xm-dvTool. Real scientific data is used for demonstration and practical applications are suggested.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Becker and Cleveland <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> introduced the notion of brushing as an interactive data exploration process in which a user visually highlights or deletes subsets of displayed data. This process provides the user an extra dimension of information as well as insight from an otherwise static display. A variety of two-dimensional brushing techniques are described by Cleveland <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Ward expanded the direct manipulation concept and created multidimensional brushing in XmdvTool <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15]</ref>. The system is a collection of four multivariate visualization techniques: scatterplot matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, star glyphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>, parallel coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">8]</ref>, and dimension stacking <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>. These tools, although powerful, suffer from the size limitation of a display. Loss of information during very large data visualization is seemingly unavoidable.</p><p>For decades, many multivariate visualization ideas have been proposed to browse large data sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>, we investigate the use of wavelets to support scientific visualization of very large univariate data. In this paper, we expand the wavelet applications to multivariate data and incorporate the concept of brushing into our visualization model. One of the distinctive features of wavelet brushing is that the brushed data is displayed at a different resolution, usually higher, than the non-brushed data. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows a simplified example of wavelet brushing on a bivariate scatterplot. As we can see, the coarse background outside the brush gives the overall structure of the context surrounding the brushed area while the fine brushed data provides the local structure inside the brushed area. The approach relies on the notion of visual inspection of the data approximation. We have also developed a quantitative measure to represent the data authenticity within an interactive data exploration environment in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>.</p><p>We implemented multiresolution brushing in an enhanced version of XmdvTool <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15]</ref>. The applications of scatterplot matrix and parallel coordinates are emphasized, although the concept is applicable to any multivariate visualization of very large data.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">General Approach and Problems</head><p>A significant characteristic of any data visualization technique is the relationship between the number of available display pixels, P, and the number of data values to be displayed, D. For a single static image the best we can expect to achieve is (D = P). 1 In fact, Keim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10]</ref> have developed such a visualization technique in the domain of database visualization.</p><p>For very large data visualization, however, D is much larger than P, so we cannot rely on any simple static image technique. Instead, we must develop mechanisms that allow us to present authentic abstractions of the data and use time as a presentation parameter to increase the effective number of pixels used to complete a visualization task. The goal of our research is to support scientific data visualization with (D P). The prevailing techniques which support large data visualization can generally be characterized as hierarchical visualization in which multivariate data is represented as a visualization hierarchy. A user needs to click the display and follow the hierarchical path to browse the data one projection view at a time. An example of this class of visualization techniques is worlds within worlds <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. These techniques require not only extra screen space to browse the data, but also the user's ability to mentally integrate dif-ferent views over time.</p><p>Problems with visualization of very large data are easily shown when considering the scatterplot matrix and the parallel coordinate representations of large multivariate datasets. multivariate plots of a nine-variate time series dataset using scatterplot matrix and parallel coordinates. Although the scatterplot matrix shows the overall structure of the data, it fails to show its local structure as neighboring data points (over 660K scatterdots) are packed together into display pixels. Problems with the parallel coordinate plot are even more severe: we cannot see anything in the lower half of the plot. The data size has to be reduced before we can apply these two techniques effectively. In the following discussion, we present results of wavelet approximations being applied to these techniques, and explain why it is desirable to have wavelet support in high dimensional brushing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Wavelets</head><p>Wavelets are based on translation (W(t) ! W(t 1)) and dilation (W(t) ! W(2t)). We discuss the characteristics and behavior of orthogonal wavelets as well as the authenticity issues of the wavelet approximations in visualization in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>. In general, wavelets can be considered as filter matrices that accept a data stream with n items, and generate n 2 items of approximations and n 2</p><p>items of details. The approximation is a coarse summary of the original data, and the details contain the data loss during the decomposition. The process of a wavelet decomposition is depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Each of the four neighboring points of the finer data (upper <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: A fine data curve is downsized to a coarse one using wavelet decomposition.</p><p>curve) are used to compute the corresponding approximation of the coarser data (lower curve). The calculation involves pre-computed matrices which are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The exact number of data points used in the downsizing process is related to the number of vanishing moments of an orthogonal wavelet. A hierarchy of coarse approximations is generated when this process is applied iteratively to the approximations to obtain increasingly coarse data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The Advantages of Wavelets</head><p>A bivariate time series data set with 8192 data points is used to demonstrate the advantages of wavelets in supporting scientific visualization. The dataset is fed into a random sampling function, a uniform sampling function, and a Haar wavelet to generate three data hierarchies with the size of each resolution equal to 2 n ; n2 Z + . In the random sampling function, data points are selected randomly for display according to the indices generated by the Unix function lrand48(). In pixel-based graphics, a common belief is that both the random and the uniform sampling functions are convenient but not very effective, particularly when the sampling rate is low <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>.</p><p>In this example, we pick the resolution with only 128 (&lt; 1:6%) data points to study. The results of the three functions are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>. The backgrounds of these graphs are scatterplots of the input data. Notice the data density is higher (as it is darker) on the left hand side of the graphs. The selected data is plotted on top of the scatterplots using polylines. Although all three functions show fairly good approximations at a very superficial level, there are a number of discrepancies among them (such as the magnitude and the spread of the data) that deserve further attention.</p><p>Each of the approximation points is required to represent well over 60 neighboring data points. We notice that the sampling rate of the random function ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4a</ref>) is very irregular. Some of the steps are much larger than the others, even among consecutive points. These are very undesirable effects as our goal is to clear up a dense data plot. Any uneven sampling area may imply that further approximations are needed.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M = 1 m m X i=1 n Y j=1</formula><p>xij ! :</p><p>Statistically, this represents the first moment of the scatter points.</p><p>The Euclidean distance between M and the corresponding approximation point is a measure of the quality of the approximation. problems of the random sampling and the uniform sampling ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 5a</ref> and b) show very clearly. Not only are the magnitudes of the differences very large, they also vary inconsistently. On the other hand, the error-bars of the wavelet approximation ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5c</ref>) show no difference at all. (This can be explained by the vanishing moments of the wavelets.) In other words, the low frequency data points generated by the wavelet are consistent and very accurate approximations to represent their neighboring data values. For operations with high frequency requirements such as outlier detection, wavelets also provide the wavelet details to filter out the high frequency outliers. We have also applied the same test to multivariate data. The results are, in effect, identical.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Multivariate Visualization Examples</head><p>In our data approximation hierarchy, the coarse resolutions highlight the overall structure of the original data while the fine resolutions provide the local structure. This works nicely with most, if not all, of the multivariate visualization techniques. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref> shows a series this resolution reduction process is very data dependent: the goal is to reach the lowest resolution that is still an authentic representation of the original data. A detailed discussion of the authenticity issue of wavelet approximations can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref> shows scatterplot matrices of a fine to coarse data hierarchy of the same five-variate dataset. Since each scatterplot displays 8192 data points, there are over 200K scatterdots displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7a</ref>. As we can see, the visual improvement of the lower resolution scatterplot matrix plots is not as dramatic as with parallel coordinates. This is largely due to the fact that each data point is represented by only a scatterdot compared to a polyline in parallel coordinates. The highly localized time-series data used in this example also plays an important role for this phenomenon. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref>, many neighboring points are quietly packed together into display pixels instead of creating chaotic patterns. A more dramatic result of using the scatterplot matrix to display multidimensional data is presented in Section 5.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">XmdvTool</head><p>Ward <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15]</ref> gives many compelling arguments for the use of high dimensional brushing in exploratory data analysis. The essence of Ward's design is the concept of providing a visual representation of multidimensional database queries as well as their results. With the addition of wavelet transforms, we argue that the operations of multidimensional brushing can be improved to support very large data visualization. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Wavelet Support</head><p>Our work follows from the system design of XmdvTool. The new functions are written in C using X/Athena Widgets. The system currently supports orthogonal wavelets with up to ten vanishing moments. (See <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref> for more details on the properties of vanishing moments of wavelet transforms.) When a data set is transformed, a fine to coarse hierarchy is generated according to the number of vanishing moments selected. Once the data brush is defined, the user is allowed to independently control the display resolutions of the brushed data and the non-brushed data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Brushing with Wavelets</head><p>The process of browsing multiresolution data suffers from the same problem as hierarchical visualization, both of them need multiple displays to browse the data. This requires not only extra screen swapping, but also the user's ability to mentally integrate different views during the process. We argue that if we allow users to control the data resolutions of the brushed and the non-brushed data, they can physically merge multiple views into one display for data exploration. Our notion of multidimensional brushing extends Ward's design to include multiresolution support.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Implementation Strategies</head><p>Two implementation strategies can be used to construct wavelet brushing. The first one contains multiple layers of approximations with the resolution decreasing (or increasing) according to its distance from the brush. Given a two-dimensional display with a square brush defined near the lower right corner of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8a</ref>, the system creates multiple layers of display data surrounding the brushed area using the wavelet approximations (as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8b</ref>.) This design gives users a smoother view of brushing. However, it also creates confusion for users to distinguish the brushed multivariate data points from the non-brushed ones. The problem is even worse for parallel coordinates as the polylines of brushed data almost always overlap with the non-brushed data. We have not yet found an effective way to clearly display data with multiple data resolutions in one display. The second implementation, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8c</ref>, contains only two layers of approximations. Once the brushing values are decided, both the brushed and the non-brushed data resolutions can be controlled independently. The user can increase or decrease the resolution of each area by clicking the corresponding button. Not only is this implementation simpler, it is easier to use and it responds faster compared to the previous implementation. In our experiments, we achieve real-time responses on a DECstation 5000 for data up to about 700K data items. The time to paint a scatterplot matrix is usually longer than for parallel coordinates. The current version of wavelet brushing supports operations of a single data brush at a time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Applications</head><p>Four applications of wavelet brushing stand out in our experiments. Three of them (resolution magnification, authenticity analysis, and outlying data identification) are multivariate visualizations while the fourth one involves high dimensional data. All of them take advantage of the multiresolution property, which may otherwise be very difficult to carry out because of the large amount of data that must be visualized. In the following discussion, the color plates which describe the applications are painted in three basic colors: red for the brushed data, blue for the non-brushed data, and light blue for the data brush. The non-brushed data (in blue) is always painted ahead of the brushed data (in red). Their resolutions are displayed in the wavelet toolbox window.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Resolution Magnification</head><p>The first application is to use the multiresolution brush as a magnifying glass to increase the resolution of a subset of the data. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref> and Color Plate 1 depict a series of parallel coordinate plots of the same time-series dataset at different resolutions. The first one is the original data. Obviously there is no visible pattern to be seen. So, the user reduces the overall display resolution gradually until the individual line patterns can barely be seen <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Figure 9b</ref> and Color Plate 1b.) From this resolution, the user finds out that the concentration of the potassium ion (the second axis on the left) drops sharply in recent times (the upper portion of the first axis on the left.) In order to study the local details of this time period, the user brushes all the data connected to this time period. The brushed data (in red), the non-brushed data (in blue), and the brush itself are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9c</ref> and Color Plate 1c. Since the interesting spots are identified, there is no need to study the details of the non-brushed data. The user can then increase the resolution of the brushed data gradually to study the local details, as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9d</ref> and Color Plate 1d. With only a few simple mouse movements, the user is able to establish evidence to show that the overall sea salt concentration (mainly potassium chloride and sodium chloride) of modern times is indeed lower than before. In addition, the last axis on the right hand side indicates a minor reduction of the overall ammonium concentration during the same time period. This can be explained by the diminishing of major volcanic eruptions recorded in modern history. This information, which is hidden behind a massive number of polylines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9a</ref>, can easily be revealed with our wavelet brushing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Authenticity Analysis</head><p>The second application involves the authenticity study of the wavelet approximation itself. When the data size of a very large dataset is reduced by a wavelet transform, there is always the question whether the approximation is a faithful representation of the original. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>, we propose the use of color to display the error information generated by wavelet transforms. With the use of multiresolution brushing, we present a short-cut to interactively verify the accuracy of the wavelet approximation during data analysis. During any course of analysis using wavelet brushing, the user can always lock the brushed data and bring back the high resolution non-brushed data to the same display. For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> and Color Plate 2, the user wants to compare the current display with the higher resolution data. This can be achieved by creating a brush which just encloses all the low resolution data as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10a</ref> and Color Plate 2a. The rest of the high resolution data is then brought back by increasing the resolution of the non-brushed data for comparison. In our example, only a few non-brushed data items (in blue) show up <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 10b</ref>  these two resolutions also indicate that further reduction may be permissible. The same process is then applied to lower resolution data with 256 items (as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10c</ref> and Color Plate 2c.) When the resolution of the non-brushed data is brought back to 2048, more blue lines appear in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10d</ref> and Color Plate 2d. By counting the number of the high resolution non-brushed data items (the blue lines) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 10b and d</ref>, we conclude that the approximation shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10a</ref> is a better representation than the one in <ref type="figure">Figure</ref> 10c.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Outlying Data Identification</head><p>It is often desirable for a scientist to identify outlying data, that is, data whose location in R n is outside that of the majority of the population. In a conventional parallel coordinate plot, locating this kind of data is not always possible. Our multiresolution brushing design, however, enables the user to display the differences between two data resolutions. These differences, in the context of orthogonal wavelet transforms, can be interpreted as the outlying data of the high resolution data. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10b</ref> and Color Plate 2b, the blue lines are the outlying data of the high resolution data which do not show up in the low resolution data (in red). When the resolution of the brushed data decreases, more blue lines show up in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10d</ref> and Color Plate 2d. Our multiresolution wavelet brushing offers another means of providing control over outlyingness <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref> for data analysis. A possible weakness of this approach is that some of the painted outlying data, which is part of the non-brushed data, can be overpainted by the brushed data. The impact of this problem, however, is much less with scatterplot matrix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">High Dimensional Data</head><p>In scientific visualization, multivariate visualization techniques are seldom applied to high dimensional data. With the support of wavelet brushing, we present such an example to study two-dimensional satellite images. The idea can be extended to three-dimensional volume data without any system modification.</p><p>For high dimensional data defined on Cartesian grids, even small dimension sizes can be multiplied into a large amount of data. For example remotely sensed satellite data usually comes with a set of measurement taken from the same location. Extracting small pieces of information from multiple variates becomes a very challenging task. A multivariate display with wavelet brushing provides a coarse overview of a series of data, and allows the user to brush slices of multivariate data for further investigation.</p><p>The XmdvTool distribution includes two sets of remotely sensed images in the file outmt.okc. This file contains four variates: x and y coordinates (in y-major order), the magnetics and the accumulated radiometrics channels of an area in Australia. The original data and its wavelet approximations are plotted by scatterplot matrix in scatterdots. Together with the x and y coordinates, the first image (i.e., the magnetics channel) occupies nine tiles in the upper left corner of the matrix. A three dimensional plot of the magnetics image is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>. Obviously, the display in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> gets simpler as the data resolution decreases. The hard part is to figure out the meaning of the approximations. To understand these approximations, we need to go back to the implementation of the approximation process. In this example, the wavelet transform is applied to the y-magnetics slices as shown in the (2;1) tiles of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>. Among them, the two which contain 1024 and 512 data points are enlarged in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>. If we carefully trace the scatterdots, there are exactly eight curves in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13a</ref> and four in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13b</ref>. These are the approximations of the y-magnetics slices of the same data depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref> displays these approximation lines with three-dimensional scatterplots of the original data with 16384 data points. The dark lines are the approximations of the surface with 1024 and 512 data points.</p><p>The scatterplot matrix provides a very efficient layout for the user to select data from multidimensional multivariate datasets. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref> and Color Plate 3, the data brush covers a subset of the x variate as shown in tile (0;0), the whole y variate in (1; 1), the whole magnetics variate in (2;2), and the whole radiometrics variate in <ref type="bibr">(3; 3)</ref>. At this resolution there are four scatterdots in (0;0).</p><p>A brush movement from one dot to the others implies horizontal brush movements in (1; 0), (2;0), and (3;0). These movements result in simultaneous selections of the y-magnetics view in (2;1), the y-radiometrics view in (3;1), and the magnetics-radiometrics view in (3;2). The combination of wavelet brushing and scatterplot matrix allows the user to study slices of the coarse approximations of the magnetics image in (2;1) and the radiometrics image in (3;1) and compare their relationships in <ref type="bibr">(3;2)</ref>. In our example, the brushed data in (3; 2) (in red) clearly indicates that the magnetics data value is not directly dependent on the accumulated radiometrics data value.</p><p>Bivariate comparison is the strength of the scatterplot matrix technique, and wavelet brushing makes it possible to apply this visualization technique to very large multidimensional data. It is easier, especially for novices, to understand the three dimensional plots in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 12 and 14</ref>, but each of these displays only shows one variate. For scientists who do exploratory data analysis with very large multidimensional multivariate data, the wavelet supported scatterplot matrix provides a unique and powerful mechanism to highlight the data from multiple variates and investigate the relationships among them.</p></div>
