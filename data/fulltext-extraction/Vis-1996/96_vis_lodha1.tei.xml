				<p>Integrated presentation of data with uncertainty is a worthy goal in scientific visualization. It allows researchers to make informed decisions based on imperfect data. It also allows users to visually compare and contrast different algorithms for performing the same task or different models for representing the same physical phenomenon. This work presents LISTEN-a data sonification system-that has been incorporated into two visualization systems: a system for visualizing geometric uncertainty of surface interpolants and a system for visualizing uncertainty in fluid flow. LISTEN is written in C++ for the SGI platform. It works with the SGI internal audio chip or a MIDI device or both. LISTEN is an object-oriented system that is modular, flexible, adaptable, portable, interactive and extensible. We demonstrate that sonification is very effective as an additional tool in visualizing geometric and fluid flow uncertainty.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The practice of presenting data together with uncertainty such as maximum-minimum range or standard deviation is quite common in traditional univariate data displays. Tukey's box plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> and Tufte's quartile plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> are two such examples. Unfortunately, most of the recent visualization work have ignored or isolated the presentation of uncertainty from the data. Nevertheless, integrated presentation of data with uncertainty is considered a worthy goal in scientific visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. This approach allows researchers to make informed decisions based on imperfect data. It also allows users to compare and contrast different algorithms for performing the same task or different models for representing the same physical phenomenon. Recently we have taken some steps in visualizing geometric and fluid flow uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. This paper focuses on adding sound capability to these uncertainty visualization systems.</p><p>The idea of using sound as an alternative or an adjunct to scientific visualization is not new <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. Although the actual experience in representing data with sound has been somewhat limited, the usefulness of integrating sound into visualization systems seems to be well recognized <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. However, to the best of our knowledge, a truly interactive and portable sonification system has not been devised as yet. We have designed and implemented LISTEN to fill this gap. We shall comment more on this in Sections 3.3 and 5.2.</p><p>LISTEN is an object-oriented system for sonifying scientific data. LISTEN is written in C++ for the SGI platform. The modular design of LISTEN makes the system very flexible, extensible and portable. LISTEN can work with the SGI internal audio chip or a MIDI device or both. One of the key features of LISTEN is its http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/slvg/listen.html adaptability, that is, it can be easily plugged into your existing visualization system. The Xforms interface provides interactive capability to the user to map data to sound parameters very conveniently. Thus, LISTEN combines the very desirable goals of interactivity, portability, adaptability, flexibility, modularity and extensibility.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes what is uncertainty, various sources of uncertainty and defines geometric and fluid flow uncertainty. Section 3 presents why the use of sound is important and describes sonification systems. Section 4 presents existing methods for visualizing and sounding uncertainty. Section 5 describes the approach and objectives of LISTEN followed by its architecture and interface. Section 6 presents applications of LISTEN to sounding geometric and fluid flow uncertainty. Finally, Section 7 concludes with final remarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">UNCERTAINTY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">What is Uncertainty?</head><p>The NIST standards report on uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> and the NCGIA initiative on Visualization of Spatial Data Quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> define data uncertainty very broadly to include concepts such as error or inaccuracy, confidence level and quality of data. Error or inaccuracy can be defined as the discrepancy between a given value and its true or modeled value. Confidence level is the level of confidence that can be associated with data and can be computed based on statistical methods or evaluation by scientific judgement. Data quality is a very broad term that encompasses many concepts including data validity and data lineage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Sources of Uncertainty</head><p>Errors or uncertainty in visualization can be introduced at different stages of visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. These stages can be broadly classified into three main categories: data acquisition, data transformation and data visualization. In the data acquisition stage, nearly all data sets, whether from instrument measurements, numerical models, or data entry have a statistical variation. In the data transformation stage, numerical calculations introduce errors due to integration algorithms and the limited precision of the computing machinery. Uncertainty is also introduced in this stage due to interpolation of data. Finally, in the data visualization stage, errors are associated with rendering models and algorithms. In this work, we focus on errors arising due to use of different integration algorithms in computing particle traces and different interpolation techniques in computing surface interpolants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Geometric Uncertainty</head><p>The geometric features of interest typically include several pieces of geometric information that are based on positional, first, second and sometimes even third derivative information. The first derivative information of interest at a point on the surface includes tangent plane information, normals and isophotes. Most of the geometric measures that capture second derivative information are based on minimum and maximum principal curvatures 1 and 2 and the associated principal directions. We refer the reader to any standard textbook on differential geometry for definitions of these geometric terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Important geometric measures for surfaces are Gaussian curvature K = 12 and mean curvature H = 1 2 1 + 2.</p><p>Both Gaussian and mean curvatures are geometric invariants that capture the local geometry of the surface. These geometric features are affected by different sources of uncertainty described in Section 2.2. They can be represented as a scalar or a vector-valued function that captures error or inaccuracy, quality or confidence level of the geometry of a surface. In this work, we shall incorporate LISTEN into a system for visualizing geometric uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. This system quantifies geometric uncertainty of a surface interpolant as the difference between geometric attributes of two different surface interpolants constructed from the same data set. As an example, the distance between two surface interpolants is a measure of distance uncertainty. Similarly the differences between the mean curvatures and Gaussian curvatures of two surface interpolants represent uncertainty in curvature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Fluid Flow Uncertainty</head><p>Features of interest in fluid flow study include position, speed, velocity, acceleration, topology, and critical points <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. These quantities are affected by different sources of uncertainties defined in Section 2.2. Many different techniques such as hedgehogs, particle tracing, surface particles, stream polygons, stream ribbons, and streamballs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> have been used for fluid flow visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. All these techniques are also subject to the different sources of uncertainties. These uncertainties can however be represented as a scalar or vector-valued function that captures error, inaccuracy or confidence level of the flow feature of interest.</p><p>In this work, we incorporate LISTEN into UFLOW -a system for visualizing uncertainty in fluid flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. ULFOW generates these fluid flow uncertainty values by varying integration methods and parameters used in generating streamlines. The degrees of freedom include (a) selecting between an Euler or 4th order Runge-Kutta integration method, b) varying the integration time steps of each method, and (c) changing the direction of the integration between forward and backward. For example, two slightly different streamlines can be generated by simply changing the size of integration time steps. Another example is when a particle is traced forward in time, then backward in time from where it ended.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">SOUND</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Why use Sound?</head><p>Sound has been used extensively in the human-computer interface to provide information about the status of processes, and as an alarm, or warning device <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we use sound in conjunction with visualization. Sonification can often provide information about data that cannot be seen using visualization. Sound can enhance a graphical presentation by providing information about features of the data that may be hidden or occluded. Sound can also help the user to distinguish the size relationships between objects that may be difficult to determine visually because of projection distortion. In multivariate mappings, where visual clutter can destroy the usefulness of the display, the addition of sound can provide relief for the overloaded visual channel by allowing some variables to be presented aurally. Also, sound can provide redundancy of representation and allow data validation. An excellent discussion of additional benefits of auditory display in conjunction with other displays can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Background</head><p>In 1982, Sara Bly demonstrated that, using multivariate mappings of data to sound parameters, it was possible to distinguish between several data sets using sound alone, and that when combined with visualization, subjects were able to distinguish between data sets with greater accuracy than with visualization alone. This work demonstrated that sonification could be useful in analyzing data <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Since then the usefulness of sonification has been repeatedly established in various applications including chemical data analysis, economic data analysis, and analysis of algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. The importance of using sound and visualization together has also been studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>.</p><p>More recently, Blattner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> used sonification to represent fluid characteristics, motion, vortex characterization and energy dissipation. For example, laminar and injection flow are represented by steady sounds. Moreover, event earcons are inserted to reflect state changes or to signal exceptional events. McCabe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> also describe mappings of computational fluid dynamics data to sound and apply these to the functioning of a heart pump.</p><p>One of the primary difficulties with sonification has been the lack of understanding of what constitutes a good mapping of data to sound, partly because human auditory perception and processing is little understood. The Exvis system by Smith et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> explored perceptually-based tools for data presentation using both visual and auditory domains. Recently, <ref type="bibr">Barrass and Robertson [4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref> have proposed a sound model similar to the HSL color model and designed Personify -a toolkit for perceptually meaningful sonification. This work suggests certain rules that can prove useful in data sonification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Sonification Systems</head><p>Most of the systems mentioned in Section 3.2 were meant to be used with a specific application. In this section, we describe general purpose sonification systems that seem to be useful in more than one application.</p><p>In the late 1980's, Astheimer <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> integrated a sonification system into the apE visualization environment. Although Astheimer provides an excellent conceptual framework for a sonification environment, the actual implementation of sonification in apE seems to be limited. Moreover, it is not clear whether this sonification system can be plugged into other visualization systems. Without this adaptability, there is a great overhead and therefore reluctance in trying this sonification system by those who do not have access to apE or who prefer to work with their own customized visualization systems.</p><p>In 1992, Madhyastha <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> presented the sonification system Porsonify that was eventually incorporated into the Pablo visualization environment -a system for exploring parallel processing. The system was implemented on the Sun SparcStation without any audio or MIDI library. Therefore, to communicate with the sound devices, daemons and device drivers had to be written to handle the interaction with the hardware. Porting the program to another platform without sound libraries would require new daemons and drivers to be written -a daunting task. It is unclear whether the high-level functionality of Porsonify is sufficiently divorced from the hardware interactions to allow for easier porting to a platform such as SGI that has sound library support. In addition, possibly because of the constraints of the platform, interaction with Porsonify is difficult. The user must work with multiple files, such as widget control files, sound hardware configuration files and sound control files to create a sonification. Because of this complexity, Porsonify has a steep learning curve.</p><p>In 1995, Minghim and Forrest presented a sonification system for visualizing volumetric data and surface properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. This system was implemented on a Macintosh Quadra as extensions to NCSA Image. It is not clear whether this system is portable. The mapping of data to sound parameters also seem to be specific to the application at hand. Therefore, the interactivity provided by the system for general mappings appears to be limited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">PREVIOUS WORK ON VISUALIZING AND SOUNDING UNCERTAINTY</head><p>Many researchers are fully aware of the uncertainty in their data. In flow and geometry visualization, they are usually displayed using one of the two methods: side-by-side comparison or superimposition (sandwich layers). For example, Buning <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and Kenwright <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> use both of these techniques in order to bring out the integration errors. Franke <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and Hagen <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> use these techniques to compare wireframe drawing of surface interpolants and contour plots of isophotes.</p><p>Other methods for displaying uncertainty include differencing <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, pseudo-coloring, and animations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Yet other techniques for visualizing uncertainty include transparency <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and its variations such as haziness <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and defocussing or Monte Carlo blurring <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Glyphs and textures, which have often been used in scientific visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>, are also being used in displaying uncertainty information <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>.</p><p>In spite of these techniques for visualizing uncertainty, sonification often provides added advantages as described in Section 3.1. However, in contrast to visualizing uncertainty, there is very little work that has been done for sounding uncertainty. In fact, we could find only two references that discuss use of sound in uncertainty. Fisher <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> maps error in soil maps to pitch, volume and rhythm. Ballas <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> uses 41 different sounds such as the telephone ring, water drip etc. to identify the causal uncertainty in identifying the source of sound in a highly overloaded sound sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">LISTEN</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Approach and Objectives</head><p>The primary objective in designing the LISTEN toolkit was to create an adaptable sonification tool, that is, a system that can be easily plugged into existing visualization systems on different platforms. This requirement is more stringent than portability.</p><p>A recurring theme among sonification researchers is that little is understood about how data should be mapped to sound, what constitutes a good mapping, the types of data and the attributes of data that can be meaningfully sonified, and how sonification can be combined with visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In order to address these issues, we wanted to create a system that allows the user maximal flexibility in exploring data using sonification.</p><p>A primary concern was achieving a high degree of interactivity, in order to support and encourage experimentation. Data mappings should be easily set up and tested, and even changed as the sonification is playing. Moreover, this interactivity should be immediate so that it should really be easy to use the system.</p><p>Another recurring theme is that there are no standards in sonification. This is particularly true for those researchers who want the full capability of sound synthesis algorithms. In such cases, they have to assemble special equipments and write their own software <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. An inexpensive alternative for real-time synthesis is to use a MIDI device. Due to the evolving MIDI standard, particularly the voice standardization of General MIDI, the core set of MIDI messages is now sufficiently standardized. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Architecture and Interfaces</head><p>Listen is written in C++ for the SGI platform. Listen works with the SGI audio chip or a MIDI device or both. Most of the newer SGI machines contain an audio chip, so that sonification can be done without adding an additional device. For greater flexibility, a MIDI device can be added. The current work uses a Yamaha PSR-320 synthesizer.</p><p>To achieve the functionality required, it was clear that the program should be highly modular. Since it was intended that the user be encouraged to modify and extend the Listen toolkit, the program had to be designed in such a way that its structure was easily understandable, and that the operations of its modules were independent of each other so that unforeseen interactions could not take place. LISTEN is an object-oriented system that incorporates all the following features -modularity, adaptability, flexibility, portability, extensibility and interactivity. In addition, LISTEN is an easy to use intuitive system. LISTEN has five modules: interface module, control module, data manager module, sound mapping module and sound device module.</p><p>Interface Module: The main function of the interface module is to handle user input and to provide feedback to the user about the state of the program. The interface has been created using the public domain Xforms package. Like Motif, it runs in the X-windows environment. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> presents the interface of LISTEN that contains menus, sliders and buttons. Thus, a user can easily specify several different sound parameters used in creating a sonification interactively.</p><p>Control Module: The control module is the intermediary between the user interface and the basic modules. Although its presence adds a level of complexity, it creates a clear separation between the functionality of the program and the interface. When the sonification is to be played, the data manager feeds the data, line by line, to the controller, to be passed to the mapping module and the sonifier. In order to integrate LISTEN into an existing visualization system, the parent visualization program needs to provide a set of well-defined data parameters to LISTEN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sound Mapping Module:</head><p>The sound mapping module keeps track of how data is to be mapped to the sound parameters as well as the minimum, maximum, and default values of the sound parameters. The sound parameters that we have implemented are pitch, duration, volume, and location. Different timbres or instrument voices can also be chosen by the user. The synthesizer we have does not support implementation of attack/decay rate without device-specific commands. It is easy to extend the system to add attack/decay rate using MIDI messages if the synthesizer supports these commands.</p><p>We have also provided the user with the facility of designing their own audio transfer functions for mapping data to sound parameters. The default mapping is linear. However the user can easily select a high-pass transfer function to sonify only high data values or a low-pass transfer function to sonify only low data values or a boolean filter to sonify data within a certain range. More generally, by moving points on the default transfer function, the user can interactively design his/her own customized possibly nonlinear transfer function to map data to sound parameters.</p><p>Sound Device Module: The device module is responsible for initializing the sound equipment and causing it to create a sound. A call to the sound device module is required for each sound produced. In order to port LISTEN to other platforms, one will simply need to rewrite the sound device module. If the new platform offers a MIDI library, then rewriting the sound device module will be an extremely easy task.</p><p>Further details regarding specific implementation issues of LIS-TEN are available in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">APPLICATIONS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Sounding Geometric Uncertainty</head><p>In this application, LISTEN was plugged into a system for visualizing geometric uncertainty of surface interpolants described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Here we only present the highlights. The system computes several different interpolants including multiquadric, inverse multiquadric, thin plate spline, C 0 linear, bilinear and C 2 bicubic B-spline interpolants on a rectangular gridded data. The system also computes many different geometric properties of these interpolants including position, normals, isophotes, principal curvatures and directions, and mean and Gaussian curvatures. The geometric uncertainty at any point is then computed as the difference between the geometric quantities of two interpolants. The geometric uncertainty is then displayed using a variety of visualization techniques that combine traditional techniques such as pseudo-coloring, differencing, animation, and overlaying with glyph and texture-based techniques.</p><p>Data Sets: We have experimented with several data sets including the six data sets used by <ref type="bibr">Franke [21]</ref> that include a wide variety of shapes including hills, valleys, cliffs, saddle points and a part of the sphere. The equations for these functions can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Choice of some of the free parameters in constructing interpolants is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. In the accompanying video, all the visualizations pertain to the first Franke's function that consists of two hills, a valley and a saddle point. These functions were sampled on a 10 10 grid on the unit interval for constructing interpolants.</p><p>Moreover, we have restricted ourselves to presenting geometric uncertainty information related to multiquadric and thin plate spline interpolants. We chose to use these interpolants because both of them received a rating of`A' in the visual category by Franke <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Demos: In the accompanying video, we present three demonstrations of sounding geometric uncertainty. In the first demonstration, we visualize the distance uncertainty, that is the difference between the multiquadric and the thin plate spline interpolant. The difference is shown in grey pseudo-color in Color Plate 1. White regions indicate regions of high uncertainty and black regions indicate regions of low uncertainty. A glyph (shown in yellow) can be selected to move along a desired line or curve. The distance uncertainty is then mapped to pitch using oboe as the timbre. Interestingly the pitch variation shows finer details in uncertainty around the black region where the glyph is shown in Color Plate 1. This variation is not apparent in the graphic alone.</p><p>In the second demonstration, we use the technique of priority sequencing. In priority sequencing, a sequence of events is prioritized according to certain rules. In our case, the events are presentation of glyphs and the priority is regions of high uncertainty. Color Plate 3 shows the graphic with glyphs, where both the height and color of the glyphs are mapped to geometric uncertainty. The higher the glyph, the greater is the uncertainty. The whiter the glyph, the greater is the uncertainty. However, due to the projection of the graphic, it is hard to glean the information from a glyph. Therefore we mapped the uncertainty to pitch and presented the glyphs in the sequence from low to high uncertainty glyphs. We found that this process enhances the understanding of quantification of uncertainty considerably.</p><p>Finally, in the third demonstration we used priority sequencing again. However, this time we mapped mean curvature uncertainty to pitch using violin and Gaussian curvature uncertainty to pitch using drum. We chose these two timbres because these timbres are easy to discriminate. This multivariate sound mapping helps in correlating distance uncertainty with mean and Gaussian curvature uncertainty. If the correlation is perfect, one will expect an increasing pitch in both the instruments. However that does not turn out to be true. By adjusting the speed of the sequencing process, the user can get more time to absorb the information before moving on to the next glyph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Sounding Fluid Flow Uncertainty</head><p>In this application, LISTEN was plugged into UFLOW -a system for visualizing fluid flow uncertainty. UFLOW is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Here we only describe the highlights. The fluid flow uncertainty system computes several different particle traces using several different numerical integration algorithms as described in Section 2.4. The fluid flow uncertainty is then displayed using a variety of visualization techniques that include uncertainty glyphs, envelopes, animations, priority sequencing, trace viewpoints and rakes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Data Sets: We have experimented with several data sets that include helical, spiral, closed loop, sharp corner and stretch-twistfold fluid flow data sets. The exact equations for the velocity field of these data sets are presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Demos: In the accompanying video, we present three demonstrations. In the first demonstration, we visualize the distance uncertainty between two particle traces for the helical data flow. As the spherical glyph moves along the trace (see Color Plate 2), the uncertainty is mapped to pitch using bells. The sound here plays the role of further validation of data quality that is brought out by the visualization. We then used the stretch-twist-fold data set. The distance uncertainty for this data set is shown as a pseudo-color strip in Color Plate 4. By mapping the uncertainty to pitch using vibes, one discovers the subtle variation in uncertainty in the blue strip region not evident by the graphic alone.</p><p>In the second demonstration, we use multivariate sound mapping by mapping the distance uncertainty to pitch using vibes and the uncertainty in the z-component to pitch using violin for the spiral data flow. While it is not possible to display both uncertainty measures by pseudo-coloring simultaneously, it is possible to sound them simultaneously. This multivariate sound mapping helps in correlating distance uncertainty with the z-component uncertainty. By adjusting the speed of the sequencing process, the user can get more time to absorb the information before moving on to the next glyph. We then change the mapping of the first uncertainty parameter to duration and find that the glyph slows down considerably in regions of high uncertainty clearly emphasizing uncertainty.</p><p>Finally, in the third demonstration, we again use the technique of priority sequencing, described in Section 6.1. Due to the projection of the graphic, it is hard to glean the information from a glyph. We mapped the uncertainty to pitch using drum and presented the glyphs in the sequence from high to low glyphs for the helical data flow. We found that this process enhances the understanding of quantification of uncertainty considerably.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have presented LISTEN -a system for sonifying scientific data. The system runs on the SGI platform using the audio chip or a MIDI device or both. The system is modular, flexible, portable, adaptable, extensible and interactive. The system is also easy to use.</p><p>LISTEN was used to sound geometric and fluid flow uncertainty. Recently LISTEN has also been incorporated into MUSURF -a system for visualizing geometric uncertainty of multiple surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In all these cases, sound mappings revealed information that was either impossible or very difficult to detect using visualization alone. Sonification also provided data validation through overloading and relief for the visual channel by sonifying additional parameters. Duration seemed to stand out as a very significant sound parameter for identifying uncertain regions when used with glyphs. Glyphs stall or slow down considerably in regions of high uncertainty easily drawing the user's attention to areas of higher uncertainty. Other visual techniques such as priority sequencing also proved very valuable in identifying uncertainty when combined with sonification.</p><p>Presentation of data and uncertainty is integrated in the audiovisual display described in this work. We believe that these methods will prove very valuable to researchers who need to make informed decisions based on imperfect data. It would be very useful to devise a way of formally testing the efficacy of LISTEN, for example, by devising an uncertainty-detection task which can be aided by visualization and sonification, perhaps by both novice and experienced users or scientists.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>User Interface of LISTEN</figDesc></figure>
