				<p>Comparative visualization has successfully been applied to a variety of fluid dynamic problems. Most applications rely on image level comparison such as experimental flow visualization versus computational flow imagery (CFI) which tries to simulate optical image acquisition in flow testing. When differences become difficult to distinguish or once a quantitative result is required, data level comparison provides powerful means to visualize data from multiple sources. Data level comparison and visualization turns out to be an essential tool in modern aircraft design projects.It is already successfully applied in the geometric preprocessing stage and the CFD analysis and will serve for comparison with experimental data as well.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Aircraft design</head><p>An on-going project for the design of a high wing transport aircraft <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> attempts the integration of aircraft geometry design tools, CFD grid generation, CAD model design, windtunnel model machining, CFD analysis, windtunnel testing and data analysis and visualization. One of the goals of the project is a higher degree of similarity between CFD and flow experiments creating all necessary geometry data from a common design thus trying to minimize the loss of details and the sources of error in various conversion processes. Comparative visualization is one of the key techniques for this integration process. The aircraft design process starts off by the design of the aerodynamic shape of the aircraft body and wing as well as other components of the aircraft. For the aerodynamic design special geometry generation techniques are in use <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Today these algorithms exist in various design tools allowing to tailor the geometry towards the particular requirements of CFD analysis codes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1</ref>). In the example given below ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> and <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>) different algorithms to deal with geometry curvature and smoothness are compared in order to find the optimum input data for a CFD code. After a decision has been taken for the geometry generation algorithm the geometry data will be transferred into a sys-tem for CFD grid generation. What system to use depends on the CFD code selected for the flow analysis. One of the codes in use, the DLR-τ-Code, requires the use of unstructured grids. Comparative visualization is used to verify the consistency of the geometry data after conversion to unstructured grid data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 1</head><p>Comparative visualization in various steps of the aircraft design process</p><p>The geometry data from the geometry generation step mentioned above was also imported into the CAD system CATIA. Details of the windtunnel model, such as screws, instrumentation, supporting parts were added manually by a designer without changing those parts of the shape which have aerodynamic significance. The model was then manufactured using numerically controlled machine tools. After manufacturing is finished the final shape of the model will be measured using automated data acquisition. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Level Comparative Visualization in Aircraft Design</head><p>Jens Trapp Hans-Georg Pagendarm DLR German Aerospace Research Establishment D37073 Göttingen, Germany visualization will be used to verify the geometry of the windtunnel model against the design data. Presently the first preliminary CFD results were obtained for the high wing transport aircraft. Comparative visualization is used to compare flow simulations with shape variations or with varying flow parameter against each other. The ultimate goal is to numerically simulate the flow around the windtunnel model at windtunnel conditions and directly compare those simulations to the experimental data, once the windtunnel testing takes place.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Comparative visualization</head><p>A classification of approaches in comparative visualization is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. These early examples emphasize the image level comparison. Data from different sources is displayed side by side using similar visualization technique to support straight forward comparison. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref> shows a comparison of the structured grid as it is generated from the geometry generation step compared to the unstructured tetrahedral CFD grid of an aircraft seen from the top as it is used for the numerical flow simulation. Note the different clustering of grid points which illustrates the flexibility of the grid generation tools to increase numerical accuracy in regions of interest. A more elaborate image level comparison is obtained from performing pixel operations on the comparable images. For example, experimental Schlieren images may be superimposed on simulated Schlieren images of numerical flow solutions using a colour mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. This techniques allows to precisely visualize and quantify properties in the data such as the spatial displacement of features like a shock wave. The concept was extended to the use of skin-friction lines in comparative visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and simulation of oil-flow pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Image level comparison often requires dedicated algorithms to simulate optical image acquisition techniques used in experimental fluid dynamics. Recently this technology called Computational Flow Imagery CFI attracts increasing attention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Comparative visualization for surface attributes on a given surface was examined by Pang anf Freeman. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> There are cases, however when differences between images are difficult to distinguish or more quantitative information is called for. This gives rise to a second type of comparative visualization which requires the differences between data of various sources to be evaluated on the data level. These differences are then visualized. For example, various geometry definition codes employ dif-ferent algorithms to ensure curvature of surfaces. The smoothness of the surface needs to be well adjusted to the requirements of the flow simulation code in order to run the flow simulation efficiently. It is very difficult to identify the differences between geometries generated from different codes. The differences are usually hard to detect for the human eye. In order to perform data level comparison, the Euclidean distance between two geometries of choice is determined for each node-point on the surface. This data is then mapped onto the geometry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 3</head><p>Wing-body junction of a high wing aircraft. Colors denote the Euclidean distance of two aircraft shapes to be compared.</p><p>This data level comparison extracts regions of interest, in this case the leading edge and trailing edge part of the wingbody junction <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref>. After performing this step of extracting the regions of geometry change one may well examine the geometry by using traditional visualization. <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> presents the data level comparison in the top view compared to a side by side comparison of the two geometries of choice in a flat shaded display. By careful selection of the illumination the different curvature becomes visible near the left trailing edge. However, the data level comparison is obviously more useful and easier to interpret as may be seen in the upper image. In cases of comparison between interpolated geometries an analysis of spatial distances may be obscured by noise in the data. In such a case the comparison of the local curvature of the surface provides a better tool in particular when looking for the quality of surfaces to be used for CFD analysis. Comparative data may be obtained by performing algebraic operations to combine the two data sets to be compared. For example a quantity such as the density of the flow fields may be compared at every position in physical space by sub-stracting the density values of the two data sets and displaying their difference.</p></div>

Curvature is displayed in the top image in a side by side comparison and the curvature difference is projected onto the surface in the bottom image.</p><p>Another method of comparative visualization combines extracted features from different data sources into a single image. In aerodynamic aircraft design the position of supersonic regions on top of a wing plays a key role. This position depends on many parameters. It may be visualized by displaying the iso-surface of Mach number equal to 1. <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> shows the shape of the supersonic region as a result of varying flow parameters, in this case a change in angle of attack.</p></div>

The two colors identify the different flow cases.</p><p>The smaller angle of attack is shown by the red iso-surface while the larger angle results in the blue surface.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Future</head><p>The comparative visualization approach has been successfully applied to compare geometries and results of numerical flow simulations. The method was easily implemented into our modular visualization system HIGHEND <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Comparative visualization is expected to become an essential tool for the verification and evaluation of windtunnel results. The geometry comparison of the windtunnel model and the computational model will be the first step once the on-going manufacturing process of the windtunnel model is finished. During the windtunnel experiments data from the windtunnel data acquisition will be compared to numerical flow simulations which have already been performed or may be performed in parallel to the testing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Side by side comparison of the curvilinear grid from the geometry generation tool and the unstructured CFD grid.
