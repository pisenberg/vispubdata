			<abstract>
				<p>In this paper, we present a new visualization approach to support Design For Manufacturing (DFM). This involves the correlation of manufacturing problems with the causative geometric characteristics. We then discuss the use of distance transform and 3-D thinning to extract these characteristics from a voxelized object. In contrast t o current Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) tools, our system is very efficient and simple to use. It does not require the skill and experience to generate and control a numerical mesh and interpret the results. The specifically tailored visualization system makes the results selfevident. Though the current domain is die casting, it could potentially be applied to many net shape processes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>An essential element in concurrent engineering (CE) is to design a part so that its geometry is compatible with the selected manufacturing process.</p><p>Traditionally, manufacturing issues have not been considered during design.</p><p>Thus, many iterations between the product designer and manufacturing engineers are required t o finalize a design, resulting in long lead times. Due to the recent emphasis on CE, the best designers now meet with potential suppliers to review the designs early and use this feedback to improve them. Still, the majority consider only the functional requirements and pass manufacturing problems downstream. In either case, the product designers are reluctant to predict the optimum design and rely primarily on the feedback of process experts for improvements. The main reason for this is the lack of proper design evaluation tools that designers can understand and are comfortable using. Current CAE tools require much computation power and knowledge to use. Consequently, they are mostly used as post design verification tools and their impact on the design process is rather limited</p><p>In this paper, we present a new visualization approach that addresses the aforementioned problems, and thus can be used in preliminary design. The system is based on a binary voxel model because of its ability to uniformly and explicitly model the interior of objects. The system has been used by several companies as part of their design packages to realize the objectives of DFM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">MANUFACTURING CONCERNS</head><p>A practical design evaluation tool should be centered around specific manufacturing issues. The current focus i s on thermal-and flow-related problems in die casting. In this section, we discuss some common manufacturing problems from a geometric point of view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Wall Thickness-Related Problems</head><p>In die casting, there are two types of wall thickness evaluation that are of importance, namely the thickness of the part and the thickness of the die steel. From the perspective of the part, abrupt changes in wall thickness may result in isolated thermal masses and pre-mature solidification which can cause many casting defects <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Barton, 1981)</ref>. Thermal masses often occur in the thick sections of a part that contain a larger amount of heat and hence may take longer to solidify than their thinner neighbors. On the other hand, thin sections of a part often induces pre-mature solidification.</p><p>They contain a relatively small amount of heat and hence may solidify too early. The pre-mature freezing in those thin sections may block the metal being pushed into the rest of the casting to fill it completely or to compensate for shrinkage. The presence of non-uniformly thin sections can also cause a metal flow jam and thus increase the amount of turbulence and entrapped gas.</p><p>Thin regions in the die also cause many manufacturing problems. The relatively "confined" regions greatly restrict the heat flow, and often result in heat trap-related problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Herman, 1979)</ref>. These thin die regions usually subject to high temperatures, causing shrinkage depressions, stress cracking, heat checking and die maintenance-related problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Gate Design Support</head><p>Gate placement has a dominant effect on the filling pattern, which in turn significantly affects part quality. A good starting point with regard to gate design is to have the gates placed so that there are no extremely remote regions from the gates and the part filling is balanced i n terms of flow distance. Measuring the flow distance involves finding the distance traversed through the casting from any point in the casting to the gate. It is a tedious and error-prone task to say the least, and depends greatly on the experience of the die caster.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">GEOMETRIC REASONING</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Thick Section</head><p>In an earlier paper, we have presented an approach t o systematically extract the thick sections of a part by using a binary voxel model and its distance transform <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Lu et al. 1995)</ref>. In this approach, distance transformation is used to compute for each voxel of the voxelized part its shortest distance to the boundary. Heavy sections can then be identified by highlighting voxels with relatively large distance values because they are farther away from the part boundary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Thin Section and Thin Die Region</head><p>The aforementioned procedure can efficiently extract the heavy mass regions of a part. However, a similar strategy, i.e. highlighting all the voxels less than a specified value, cannot be used to explicitly extract the thin sections; otherwise all the voxels on the part boundary would be selected as thin. In fact, the wall thickness can be truthfully represented only by the distance transform values of the voxels that lie near the medial surface. To identify the thin regions, therefore, the voxel model needs to be enhanced by labeling the voxels of the medial surface. In addition, for the extraction of the geometric characteristics of the die, the distance transformation and the identification of the medial surface should be applied to the die. Based on this representation, thin regions of the part and of the die can be extracted b y identifying the medial surface voxels associated with smaller distance values.</p><p>Extension of the 2-pass distance transformation algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Borgefors, 1984)</ref> to cover the die is rather straightforward; however, the generation of an appropriate medial surface representation, the so called thinning skeleton, is not an easy task. Basically, thinning of an object is achieved by continuously deleting simple points from an object's boundary while retaining the end points until the final skeleton is left. The simple point criteria are used to preserve the connectivity and the end point criteria are used to preserve the geometric features. Over the past decade, many thinning algorithms have been proposed, though most of them concentrated on 2-D (refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Lam et al., 1992</ref> for a comprehensive survey). Recently, much attention has also been devoted to the generation of 3-D thinning skeleton (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Ma, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lee et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Kong and Rosenfeld, 1989)</ref>. In the application, we use the thinning approach proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lu et al. (1996)</ref> .</p><p>It should be noted that many of the simple point criteria, including our own, require the calculation of the number of n-connected black components (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lee et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Kong and Rosenfeld, 1989</ref>). An n-connected black component is a set of object (black) voxels where all the object voxels are n-connected. Most researchers address this problem by using modified flooding algorithms t o connect voxels, so it is very time-consuming <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Lee et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ranjan, 1991)</ref>. Here, we informally describe a new algorithm to expedite the process. The algorithm is applied to 26-connected objects only. It involves dividing the 26-neighborhood of a point into 8 overlapping 2x2x2 octants. If any voxel in an octant is black, that octant i s treated as occupied. In addition, if two occupied octants are joined by a common black voxel, then all the black voxels in the two octants are 26-connected. Therefore, the number of connected black components is equal to the number of distinct groups of connected black octants, and "flooding" can be performed on the 8 octants rather than on the 26 voxels, resulting in a significant decrease i n processing time. A formal proof of this algorithm can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lu et al. (1996)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Flow-Distance</head><p>The system provides the designer with an accurate and systematic means of finding the flow distance for userspecified potential gate locations. Based on the candidate gate locations, it computes the flow distance from every voxel in the part to these locations by using a 3-D distance transform. In this case, the distance transform computes for each voxel of the die casting, the shortest distance, through the part, to the region specified as the gate. Since only ordinal information is provided, the 6distance, i.e. the so called city block distance, is used. This facilitates comparison of the various regions of the part allowing the user to find regions of comparatively long flow distances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">RESULTS</head><p>To support the visualization of the analysis results, a new rendering method, called template-based leaping, was developed. The ideas are similar to the template-based ray casting approach proposed by <ref type="bibr">Yagel and Kaufman (l992)</ref>. Since the analysis has extended the distance transform t o the die, this information can be used to further expedite the ray casting <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Zuiderveld et al. ,1992)</ref>. Specifically, while traversing the volume, a ray can jump N steps at any nonobject voxel, based to its distance value N, without missing any object voxels. This is because the closest object voxel at this point is N steps away. Since the leaping is applied to a template, the rendering can be significantly expedited. It should be noted that 26connected rays are used for rendering in our application, because of the short computation times and uniformsampling. The evaluation, however, is based on 6distance. The incompatibility of the two metrics can cause the ray to overshoot the object. To avoid this, a conversion table is built based on the form of the ray. It basically translates the 6-distance into the steps that can be skipped by the 26-connected rays.</p><p>When displaying the results, different colors are used to highlight the different problems. In the case of the thick section and flow-distance analysis, all regions of the part that are thicker than the specified distance value or closer than the specified distance value will be highlighted as red. For the case of thin sections, all the skeletal voxels with a distance value less than the specified threshold will turn green. The user also has the option to perform thinning analysis for the die, in which case the thin die regions will be displayed in yellow.</p><p>In this research, animation is utilized in our visualization module to provide a better means of facilitating the identification of the problem regions. This not only provides another depth cue, resulting in better perception of the geometry, but the continuously varying distance threshold also helps designers better perceive the problems. For the heavy section results, the places where the red regions vanish and turn completely gray are the thin regions. If the 3-D thinning analysis is performed, once the shrinking core reaches the medial surface, the skeletal voxels stand out explicitly with a green color. This can help the user better comprehend the occurrence of those breaks, i.e. thin section problem. In this way, the regions where the core persists the longest are the thickest and the regions that are the first to turn green are the thinnest regions. For the flow distance, animation gives user a better perception of how the flow distance proceeds and whether the flow distance is balanced. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the shaded image (a) of the part that was developed in-house for die casting studies and the analysis results for that part (b). <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the wall thickness analysis results for another part <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>) sent to us for comment and consultation. This design of the part was associated die maintenance problems caused b y thermal fatigue of the dies between the cylindrical projections of the part, near its base. This region is clearly visible in the sectioned view of the part shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  1</ref>. It was determined that these problems were caused b y insufficient die steel to adequately conduct the heat away. As can be seen, our analysis was able to identify the region with insufficient die steel (the yellow region i n <ref type="figure">Figure 2(a)</ref>). The thinning analysis also identified the thin sections of the part (green regions in <ref type="figure">Figure 2(b)</ref>). Therefore, if this tool were available, the designers could have identified this problem early and could have redesigned the part appropriately, long before much effort was expended on detailing. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows the analysis results of the flow distance calculation. It can be seen from these pictures that a portion of the thinnest section is far from the gate and therefore may not fill completely. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>: 3-D Sectioned View of an Example Part (a): Thin die region (b) : Thinnest and heaviest regions of part Figure 2: The results of wall thickness evaluation (a): Shaded image of an example part (b): Thinnest region of the part Figure 3: Example to illustrate the visualization of thin sections (a): Short distance from the gate (b): Long flow distanceFigure 4: The results of flow distance calculations</figDesc></figure>
