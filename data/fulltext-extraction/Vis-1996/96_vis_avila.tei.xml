				<p>Volume visualization techniques typically provide support for visual exploration of data, however additional information can be conveyed by allowing a user to see as well as feel virtual objects. In this paper we present a haptic interaction method that is suitable for both volume visualization and modeling applications. Point contact forces are computed directly from the volume data and are consistent with the isosurface and volume rendering methods, providing a strong correspondence between visual and haptic feedback. Virtual tools are simulated by applying three-dimensional filters to some properties of the data within the extent of the tool, and interactive visual feedback rates are obtained by using an accelerated ray casting method. This haptic interaction method was implemented using a PHANToM haptic interface.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Traditional methods for visualizing volumetric data rely almost entirely on our powerful sense of vision to convey information. While this has proven quite effective for most visualization tasks, it remains worthwhile to investigate the benefit of augmenting these visualization methods with information obtained through other sensory channels. In particular, our sense of touch, in combination with our kinesthetic sense, is capable of supplying a large amount of information about the structure, location, and material properties of objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The study of the many issues related to interaction with an environment through the sense of touch is known as haptics.</p><p>Haptic rendering is the name given to the process of feeling virtual objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This involves tactile feedback for sensing properties such as surface texture, and kinesthetic feedback for sensing the shape and size of objects. Traditional methods for producing convincing haptic renderings have mainly utilized scenes comprised of geometric primitives such as polygons, spheres, and surface patches. These investigations have generally focused on simulating realistic interactions with static and dynamic collections of geometric objects given the capabilities and limitations of haptic devices. Although the benefits of haptic rendering volume data have been recognized <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, this area of research has not yet been fully explored.</p><p>Haptic interaction has been successfully applied to simulate specific tasks in several application areas. In molecular docking studies, a robotic arm was used to supply molecular interaction forces <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In another application, a haptic device was used as a nanomanipulator for a scanning tunneling microscope <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, enabling scientists to manipulate individual atoms on a surface. A medical planning and training system <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> has also been developed which simulates knee palpation through the use of visual and haptic feedback.</p><p>One goal of the work presented in this paper is to develop a haptic interaction method for use in a volume visualization system. There are several reasons to pursue the addition of haptic cues to volume visualization. The use of a force feedback device during visualization is a natural output method for interactively conveying complex information to the user. This is particularly useful when the user attempts to precisely locate a feature within a volume, or to understand the spatial arrangement of complex three-dimensional structures.</p><p>A second goal of this haptic interaction method is to allow the haptic device to be used for input as well as output. The position and orientation of the haptic device could be used to simulate a virtual tool that could modify local properties of the volume dataset. For example, this modification ability can be employed during data exploration to alter visibility of one structure to allow visual access to another. Data modification can also be used for three-dimensional annotation of scientific data. In addition, the field of volume graphics <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> can benefit from a haptic data modification method that allows for interactive, virtual volume modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>This paper is organized into eight sections. An overview of the haptic interaction method is given in Section 2. The volume data representation used for visual and haptic interaction is covered in Section 3. We discuss our haptic rendering method in Section 4, while the corresponding volume rendering method is described in Section 5. Techniques and tools for data modification are covered in Section 6. Our implementation, and some results of this method are given in Section 7, while Section 8 concludes the paper with a discussion of future work.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">System Overview</head><p>We identified several major requirements that must be met by a haptic visualization method in order to provide meaningful force feedback and data modification capabilities.</p><p>• Constant haptic refresh rate: Large variations in the rate at which forces are updated can produce distracting tactile artifacts. • Fast force calculations: Complex force computations would reduce the haptic refresh rate and would therefore decrease the amount of processing time available for rendering and data modification. • Fast, incremental rendering: Interactive render rates are necessary for visual feedback of the haptic pointer location and data modification, and the time cost of rendering must be amortized over a number of force feedback iterations to maintain a consistent haptic refresh rate. • Fast data modification: Interactive data modification rates are required for both visual and force feedback.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Consistent haptic and volume rendering: Volume</head><p>rendering and haptic rendering should be consistent.</p><p>A structure which appears amorphous should also feel amorphous.</p><p>To satisfy these five major requirements, we made some assumptions about the force feedback, rendering, and data modification computations that could occur during haptic interaction. First, the force feedback and data modification calculations are restricted to using only a local area of data values. In addition, viewing, lighting, and global material properties are fixed during haptic interaction, and a local data modification operation must effect only a small region of the displayed image.</p><p>Based on the major requirements of the system, and the assumptions that were made, we developed the haptic visualization method illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The haptic interaction loop begins after an initial image of the scene has been computed. The first step in the interaction loop is to obtain the current position and orientation of the haptic pointer from the physical device. We will refer to the virtual counterpart of this physical pointer device as the "tool", since it will often be used, for example, as a virtual scalpel, chisel, or paintbrush. If we determine that a data modification operation is necessary at this time, the modification computation is performed, and the volume database is updated. In addition, the pixel status buffer is updated to indicate which pixels of the image have been affected by this modification operation. Once this optional modification step is complete, the current force is computed and supplied to the haptic device. During the rendering phase, some small number of the pixels that require updating are rendered using a ray casting method. Finally, if it is time to refresh the physical display device, the current image is copied to the screen and the graphics hard-ware is used to render a geometric object that indicates the size, position, and orientation of the current tool.</p><p>The data modification operation does not occur during every iteration of the haptic interaction loop. Instead, a timer indicating elapsed time since the previous modification is consulted during each iteration. If this elapsed time exceeds some threshold, the modification operation is performed. The main reason for limiting the rate at which data modification occurs is that we are maintaining a haptic refresh rate of 1 to 5 KHz. Therefore, there is only a small amount of computational time left over after the force calculation in each iteration. Increasing the rate of data modification would decrease the amount of time available to update the pixels of the image affected by the modification.</p><p>The rate at which the physical display device is refreshed is also limited by an elapsed time threshold. In this case, a 30Hz limit is imposed since a refresh rate much greater than this is unnecessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data Representation</head><p>A volume is represented as a 3D rectilinear array of volume elements, or voxels, each specifying a set of scalar properties at a discrete grid location. An interpolation function is used to produce a continuous scalar field for each property. This is critical for producing smooth volume and haptic rendering.</p><p>In order to meet the requirements of the system, the contents of each voxel must contain a large number of physical properties. This includes a scalar value for density, values for material classification and shading properties, as well as values for mechanical properties such as stiffness, and viscosity. In addition, it is often desirable to precompute and store values that do not often change such as density gradients and partial shading results for each voxel. Given unlimited memory resources, each voxel would contain high precision storage for each of these parameters.</p><p>One possibility that we considered was to store the volume in a space-efficient, hierarchical data structure such as an octree, thereby reducing storage requirements in empty areas of the volume. There are two problems with this approach. First, maintaining the requirement of a consistent haptic refresh rate is far easier when the time required to read and modify voxel values is constant. Second, in many cases data modification operations will lead to datasets that can no longer be stored efficiently in hierarchical data structures.</p><p>When defining the values stored in each voxel in the rectilinear grid, we considered interactive rendering rates to have highest priority, since that is a direct requirement of the system. The ability to render large datasets was given the next highest priority, and property modification flexibility was considered last. From these priorities, we obtained the definition of a voxel requiring 8 bytes as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. Three bytes are allocated for gradient magnitude and direction in order to save time during volume rendering. A 24 bit color, rather than a color LUT, is stored within each voxel to ensure compositing and painting operations on volumes include fine details. A collection of material properties is indexed through a look up table. An entry in the table specifies additional characteristics such as material classification and shading parameters. Haptic properties such as stiffness and viscosity may also be assigned to an index.</p><p>Material opacity is generally stored in a table indexed by the LUT index, the density value, or both the density and gradient magnitude values. Material classification, shading properties, and haptic properties are typically obtained through a segmentation process applied to the density values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Haptic Rendering</head><p>The system allows for the exploration and modification of both isosurface and translucent volumes. The forces generated can either be constructed to approximate a realistic feel of a virtual object or to convey meaningful structural information for data exploration purposes. In the case where the user wishes to explore internal structures of a rigid body, such as bone, it is desirable to produce contact forces and visual characteristics which are inconsistent with bone, but that allow the user to penetrate the bone to feel and see internal structure.</p><p>The force equations are based on two principal requirements. First, the interaction forces must be calculated fast enough to be used within an interactive system. Typically, force update rates of 1-5 KHz are generated for this system. Second, the forces imparted to the user should be consistent with the rendering of the volumetric object.</p><p>In order to meet the speed requirement and since the haptic device we used can only handle translation forces, the force calculation is simplified to a point contact. This has been shown to be a reasonable simplification for many tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The general equation we used for feeling an object using a point contact model is: and is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. The force supplied to the user located at position P and moving in direction is equal to the vector sum of an ambient force , a motion retarding force , and a stiffness force normal to the object . The ambient force is the sum of all forces acting on the tool that are independent of the volumetric data itself. Some forces such as gravitational or buoyant forces are independent of the tool position while other forces such as synthetic guide forces, which aid the user during interactive volume modification, are dependent on position. For example, a virtual plane perpendicular to a surface can be used as a guide when attempting to cut a straight line. The ambient force would be used to guide the tool back to the plane. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F A R V ( ) S N ( ) + + = F V A R V ( ) S N ( )</formula><p>The motion retarding force is proportional to velocity and can be used to represent a viscous force. The last term captures the stiffness of the object and is always in the direction of local gradient. When simulating interaction on rigid surfaces, which are generally governed by Hooke's law, this term can then be set to a linear force function in the direction of the surface normal and proportional to the penetration distance of point P.</p><p>This general equation for force feedback is the basis for calculating forces which are consistent with different types of rendering methods. The forces generated are not intended to be a realistic simulation of interacting with materials. Rather, the intent is to convey additional information to the user about the data being explored.</p><p>The display of volume data requires a segmentation step in order to determine the visual appearance of the projected volume. In a similar manner, we introduce a segmentation step which produces tactile properties to the volume. In order to ensure consistency between visual and haptic rendering, the transfer functions used for the assignment of visual and tactile properties are similar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Haptic Volume Rendering</head><p>When rendering a translucent volume we employ a gradient magnitude segmentation method <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> in order to assign opacities. The segmentation method specifies an opacity transfer function , where the opacity value at a sample location is defined by both the material density and the magnitude of the density gradient at that location. The function can be specified in a number of different ways. As was done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, we compute values by multiplying a density transfer function by a gradient magnitude transfer function. In order to keep volume and haptic rendering consistent, force transfer functions and are constructed which are similar to , but produce force magnitudes rather than opacities. The retarding and stiffness force functions for haptic volume rendering become:</p><p>The normal vector is computed using central differences. We found that a linear correspondence between the visual transfer function and the haptic transfer functions produced an intuitive force response, as in:</p><p>Essentially, the more opaque a material, the greater its stiffness and motion retarding properties. The stiffness function has an implied zero additive constant to ensure that the initial contact with an object starts from a zero force.</p><p>Other mappings of the opacity transfer function may be suitable depending on the type of forces required. For instance, an exponentially increasing opacity transfer function may be translated into a linear force response through the use of a logarithmic function.</p><p>If our intent was to simulate a realistic haptic and visual rendering of a volume, then the segmentation of the volume into all relevant material characteristics would be necessary. The properties in the new representation would replace the approximations found in the visual and haptic transfer functions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Haptic Isosurface Rendering</head><p>The fast and robust calculation of stiffness and motion retarding forces is essential when interacting with volumetric isosurfaces. Unfortunately, the stiffness computation requires that the penetration distance of the tool below the isosurface is available at every location in the volume. While it is possible to precompute the distance to an isosurface for every voxel in the volume, we decided to investigate techniques for approximating stiffness and retarding forces based only on the density field. There are two reasons for this. First, the system allows for the interactive modification of the volume. Creating a new distance map for the volume would be prohibitive. Second, for small penetration distances, the density field itself can give a reasonable approximation of the distance to an isosurface.</p><p>Similar to volume rendering, the retarding and stiffness force functions used to feel a surface are dependent on transfer functions: </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">V α t α d ∇d , ( ) = α t α α t r t s t α R V ( ) V tr d ∇d , ( ) - = S N ( ) N N -------t s d ∇d , ( ) = N t r d ∇d , ( ) C 1 t α d ∇d , ( ) C 2 + = t s d ∇d , ( ) C 3 t α d ∇d , ( ) = R V ( ) V f r d ( ) - = S N ( ) N N -------f s d ( ) =</formula><p>Here the density is used as an indicator of penetration distance in the thin shell between the isosurface density values and , where . The function maps density values into retarding force magnitudes while maps density value into stiffness force magnitudes.</p><p>We set these functions to:</p><p>The retarding force is set to a linear function proportional to the difference in density above . Similar to haptic volume rendering, the coefficients , , and specify a linear mapping from density values to force magnitudes. The stiffness force varies from zero to depending linearly on where the value lies between and . This can be viewed as a penetrable shell model with viscous internal properties. A nice property of this model is that it allows the user to feel subsurface structure when the density and normal vector change below the surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Rendering</head><p>In order to provide fast rendering of isosurfaces and translucent volumes, we use a volumetric ray tracing method <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> to generate images of the volumetric data. This method is flexible since it allows for the rendering of multiple independent, possibly overlapping volumetric objects. If the viewing position is fixed and global effects are ignored during the haptic interaction loop, then data modification operations correspond to local image updates within the image-space extent of the modified region of the volume.</p><p>When modeling a solid object, an isosurface representation is a natural choice for both force feedback and rendering. To produce high quality images, the ray tracer computes the analytical intersection of the ray with the isosurface as defined by the interpolation function, and a central differences technique is employed to estimate surface normals. When modeling amorphous objects such as smoke and clouds, a volumetric feedback equation and rendering method are required. Images are generated by sampling material properties along a ray, and compositing them to produce a final pixel intensity value.</p><p>Using a standard ray tracing method, the computation required to update even a small region of the image (typically 30 2 to 50 2 pixels for a 512 2 image) may be too slow for interactive object modification. Therefore an acceleration method must be employed to achieve interactive frame update rates. In this haptic interaction method, the Polygon Assisted Ray Casting (PARC) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> is employed to avoid casting rays through empty regions of the volume. This acceleration method relies on a projection of a geometric approximation of the volume to avoid segments of rays that pass through empty regions of the volume. We use the standard hardware projection method to render the full geometric approximation when the initial image is generated. The geometric approximation is updated whenever the scalar field of a volume is altered by a data modification operation. A software projection method is then used to update only the affected pixels with the new geometric approximation.</p><p>When data modification occurs, flags are set to indicate which pixels must be recomputed. During each iteration of the haptic interaction loop, some small number of pixels are updated (typically less than 10), and the flags for these pixels are cleared. When the display device is refreshed, the current image may contain some pixels which have not yet been updated, producing results similar to those obtained by frameless rendering techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Typically these effects are not noticed since the tool obscures the region of the volume being modified for a few frames. By the time this region becomes visible in the image, these pixels have been updated.</p><p>The current image is stored in the image buffer, with a color, opacity, and depth value stored for each pixel location. The depth value indicates the distance from the image plane at which the ray cast through that pixel accumulated an opacity value greater that . When the display device requires refreshing during the haptic interaction loop, this image is copied into the color and depth components of the framebuffer. Fast projection of the tool is then obtained through the use of graphics hardware. For opaque surfaces, opacity values stored in the pixels are binary, therefore is equivalent to , and this method correctly combines the ray traced image of the volume with the projection of the tool. When the tool is within a translucent volume, the combination provides only an approximate image since the opacity value stored in a pixel represents the final opacity of all accumulated samples, and the distance value represents the location along the ray at which the accumulated opacity reached . In our experience, adequate images are generally produced with . If more accurate combined images are required during the modification of internal features in a translucent volume, they can be generated at the cost of memory or computation time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Data Modification</head><p>The data modification component of our haptic visualization method is an optional component that can be used to modify any local property of the data stored in the volume database. A local property is one that affects only</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">d d i d j d i d j &lt; f r d ( ) f s d ( ) f r d ( ) d i d d j ≤ &lt; ( )C 4 d d i - ( ) C 5 + otherwise 0    = f s d ( ) d i d d j ≤ &lt; ( )C 6 d d i - ( ) d j d i - ( ) -------------------- otherwise 0      = d i C 4 C 5 C 6 C 6 d d i d j V α V α 0 ≠ V α 1 = V α V α 0.25 ≈</formula><p>a small region of the volume, and therefore will cause only a small region of the image to require updating. As described in Section 3, three modifiable values are stored for each data sample: material density, color, and an index value. Density and color are independent data properties. Stiffness, material classification, and material shading parameters such as opacity and ambient, diffuse, and specular reflectivity are dependent properties stored in look-up tables that are indexed by either the index value, or the density value. The values in the look-up tables cannot be modified since this would result in global changes in the appearance of the volume. Instead, the index value or density value used to index the look-up table is modified. Independent data properties can be modified by setting them to a constant value, or by applying a filter to the current values. The index value defining dependent data properties is generally only modified using the constant value method unless there is a linear relationship between this index value and all the properties represented by this value. For the independent color values, we could use the constant value method to "paint" an object red by setting the color property at the tool location, or some small region centered at the tool location, to red. In addition, we could define the material properties of the paint by also setting the index value, which would change all properties dependent on the index value simultaneously.</p><p>With the filter method, we could "melt" an object by updating density values in a small region around the tool location according to , where is the new density value, is the current density value, and is obtained by sampling a spherical filter with a Gaussian distribution centered at the tool location. In contrast to melting, we can "construct" an object using , where is the density of the material that we are adding to the volume. Note that melting is just a special case of constructing with . In fact, constructing will appear like melting whenever the opacity of is less than the opacity of the density that it is replacing. The two modification methods described above can lead to a wide variety of tools by varying the constant value or filter type, and the data properties that are modified. The most difficult part of defining a new tool is selecting a tool name, since there are many possible virtual tools that do not have physical counterparts. In our system, a modification operation is defined by providing the modification method, the extent of modification, the properties affected, and any necessary filter and constant values. A tool is composed of one or more modification operations, with the condition that no property is affected by more than one modification operation in a tool. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> illustrates the use of some common tools on a volumetric wall. These tools are described briefly in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, where the first</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">d i 1 α - ( )d i 1 - = d i d i 1 - α d i αD 1 α - ( )d i 1 - + = D D 0 = d i d i 1 -</formula><p>column indicates a tool name, the second column lists the modification method used for each operation, the third column defines the properties that are modified for each operation, and the last column describes the modification process. Specific constants for the instance of the tools shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> are given in parenthesis in the last column.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Implementation and Results</head><p>The methods discussed in this paper were implemented on a Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 Extreme workstation with a 200 MHz R4400 processor and 96 MB of RAM. A 1.5x PHANToM haptic interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> was used to provide force-feedback. The PHANToM connected directly to the workstation through an EISA bus.</p><p>The haptic interaction loop described in Section 2 was implemented as a single process, and was responsible for computing forces, modifying the volume, and rendering. We typically visualized volumetric objects using a image, with data modification rates of 10Hz, image update rates of 20Hz, and force update rates of 5KHz. Faster data modification rates are possible, but are not practical due to the precision limitations imposed by representing density and the components of color as 8 bit values. The force update rate is higher than the minimum required rate of 1KHz, and could potentially be reduced to 3KHz to provide more processing power for rendering in a larger image.</p><p>Special care was taken to ensure that the system would not produce unsafe forces. At the start of a haptic session, the system computes forces but does not apply them until a force within an acceptable range is calculated. This prevents a user from starting haptic feedback in an area of high force magnitude. In addition, all forces are checked against a maximum force threshold. If this value is exceeded, the system shuts down haptic interaction.</p><p>Another concern that we faced was the ergonomics of the system. During haptic interaction, the tight link between visual and tactile feedback can often trick a user into believing that she is holding a real tool, and interacting with a physical object. This illusion is shattered as soon as the user attempts to rest her hand against the object for greater control of small movements. We have found that providing places for the user to rest her elbow and wrist can help to maintain this illusion of physical reality. These resting places are also necessary to help reduce fatigue and muscle strain that could be caused by prolonged use of a haptic device. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> illustrates the use of the system in understanding a complex set of dendrites emanating from a lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) cell. This voxel LGN cell was scanned with a confocal microscope, and volume and haptic rendered as discussed in Section 4.1. The ability to feel as well as see the dendrites provides a large amount of additional information when visualizing this data. It proved useful to determine the path of intertwined dendrites using haptic feedback. However, a problem was encountered when feeling the path of dendrites since it was easy to slip off the dendrite and have to feel your way back to resume exploration. One solution to this problem was to invert the mapping of opacities to force magnitudes such that the high opacities attracted the tool. This made following winding dendrites a far easier task.</p><p>Another example of where haptic interaction can be used to explore scientific data is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5</ref>. A CT data set of the Visible Human's foot was segmented and visualized as a skin surface and a bone surface. Initially, the bone surface is completely contained within the skin, and is therefore not visible in the image. An "invisibility" tool is used to set the LUT indices on a portion of the skin surface to a value that represents an invisible material, revealing the inner bone structure for visual inspection. Since the density values have not been modified, force feedback is still provided for the transparent skin regions. With a strong input force, the user can "poke" through the skin surface to explore internal features.</p><p>The ability to feel and modify a volume rendered object was used to annotate and cut a voxel CT head shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figures 6 and 7</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 6</ref> shows the tool cutting into the surface of the skull, revealing interior regions of bone. Prior to cutting, a black circle was traced on the surface as a cutting guide. The forces assigned to the skull were selected to be rigid, providing a sensation similar to bone. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref> shows the skull after the removal of the cut out section. Additional punctures and annotations were also placed on the surface. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref> shows a volumetric scene created from an empty volume with a resolution of voxels. Several construction and painting tools were used, and the image was generated using a volume rendering technique. This haptic interaction method can form the basis of a volume modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> or painting <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> system that would allow for the creation, modification, and rendering of both solid and amorphous objects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Future Work</head><p>We have found that the integration of haptic interaction into a scientific visualization process can lead to a better understanding of complex, three-dimensional data, and can result in more natural, intuitive methods for modifying this data. One limitation that we encountered during our work was the lack of rotational forces, since the PHAN-ToM device provides only three degrees of translational force feedback. An area of future research that we would like to explore is the extension of our force feedback equations and data modification operations for haptic devices that provide six degrees of freedom in both input and output.</p><p>We found it difficult to work with high frequency data using the force equations presented in this paper. When the density field changes from empty space to dense object within one or two voxels, it is difficult to provide force feedback without producing unwanted vibrations. We would like to investigate methods for reducing these vibrations on high frequency data. This may include limit- ing the speed at which the user can move through these regions, providing spherical rather than point contact, or maintaining auxiliary buffers that indicate the distance to a surface.</p><p>Physically realistic haptic interaction is another area that requires further investigation. This includes the ability to obtain, store, and modify material properties that define how an object reacts to an applied force. We would also like to investigate methods for quickly computing forces for more realistic tools. For example, an artist could feel the bristles of the brush interact with the object as he paints.      </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>An overview of the haptic visualization method.
