				<p>We describe a graphical system developed for researchers in materials science for extracting information from data obtained by atomic force microscopy. In particular, we consider the problem of computing surface orientations from data obtained from ceramic materials. The visualization problems we consider in designing this system include finding useful mechanisms for the researcher to interact with the data, presenting results in forms familiar to the scientist, and enhancing traditional display techniques.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Over the past ten years, there has been growing and widespread use of scanning probe microscopes for studying nanometer scale structures of materials. These microscopes produce digital data in a quantity that requires visualization tools in order that the materials scientist can extract meaningful information. Grey scale images of the output are routinely recorded to video tape to allow scientists to view "time-lapse" presentations of surface phenomena (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). Two-dimensional image processing techniques are used to identify and measure features. A virtual reality system with stereo display and haptic feedback has been designed to examine the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. There is still a need however to provide improved methods to visualize and extract information from scanning probe microscope data.</p><p>In the project described here, we consider extracting surface orientation information from data obtained using an AFM (atomic force microscope). The result is a visualization and analysis tool that allows the scientist to extract information in a familiar form using processing that is interactively controlled with simple parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>The materials science issue addressed by this work falls under the heading of energy minimization, specifically the minimization of the total energy of a fixed volume of a crystalline solid in equilibrium with a vapor or liquid phase at constant temperature, pressure and composition. Thus, we are concerned with minimization of the total surface energy of the system and how changes in surface area and orientation can reduce the energy of the system. We refer to this energy-minimizing surface as the equilibrium shape. For crystalline solids the energy of a surface is a function of the surface orientation. If the energy as a function of orientation, , is a constant then the equilibrium shape is a sphere. If varies with orientation then other shapes will be lower energy even though the total surface area is larger. For highly anisotropic , the equilibrium shape will consist only of flat facets, as seen on natural crystals.</p><p>The visualization techniques described here aid the researcher in accurately characterizing crystal surface morphologies and understanding the geometry of faceted crystals. We are concerned with surfaces that are constrained to have a specific average surface normal, rather than the case of an isolated crystal. Such cases occur on the surface of a polycrystalline material. An initially planar surface can lower its energy by facetting into a combination of two or three facets while maintaining the same average orientation.</p><p>Recent work has focused on samples of alumina, Al2O3. From other experiments, we know that the equilibrium shape of alumina is faceted, but we do not know all the facets that occur nor the energy of the facet planes. By collecting facet orientation information and crystallographic normals for many cases, we can specify facet geometry and put limits on the equilibrium shape. This information is useful in understanding the development of dense ceramics from powders by heat treatment, and can lead to improved properties.</p><p>The data are acquired with an AFM from Digital Instruments 1 (http://www.di.com). Detailed discussions of the technology can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The AFM uses a probe in contact with a surface to measure heights at regularly spaced discrete points to produce a height map of the surface. These data contain random and systematic errors, such as errors due to bouncing of the AFM tip assembly and the concealment or distortion of small features due to the size and shape of the tip, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>. The probe is rounded, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1b</ref>. As long as it is following a large flat surface, it can faithfully record the surface variations. However, the tip cannot fit into sharp valleys, and rounds out sharp peaks (as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1c)</ref>.</p><p>Before the development of this system, the available visualization tool was software that was provided by the manufacturer of the AFM. While it was able to show pictures of the surface, user interaction was cumbersome. Furthermore, the orientation of small regions of the image could not be easily extracted and there was no ability to handle random errors.</p><p>The goals of this visualization effort are to aid the researcher in the following tasks: identification of surface facets from AFM height data calculation of facet normal vectors and angles between facets recognition and filtering of problematic data. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Approach and Implementation</head><p>Because existing tools lacked satisfactory user interfaces, we decided to develop a more interactive system with some direct manipulation of the data representations. It was also important to integrate significant data analysis into the system. Given the resources available to us, we decided to base the implementation on the AVS visualization software package (http://www.avs.com), writing custom modules as needed. An image showing the output from the system is shown in Color Plate 1. We briefly consider now aspects of the system design.</p><p>Identifying the Region of Interest AFM data sets are typically 512x512 samples, but the area of interest is usually much smaller. The researcher is looking for well-defined facets or grain boundaries. (A grain is a portion of a polycrystalline solid composed of a single crystal.) The system presents the user with a 2D grey-level representation of the data set, with the grey-level proportional to the height. The user can zoom and pan over this image and visually identify regions of interest.</p><p>Initially, the system enabled the user to sketch freely an arbitrarily shaped region of interest. We found that this much freedom actually made results difficult to interpret. After experimentation we found two useful methods for selecting an area: selection by rubberband box, and selection by outlining an arbitrary polygon. These are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>. In each method, a region is extracted and a 3D height field representation is presented. This representation is, in some sense, a reconstruction of the geometry of the surface and enables the researcher to qualitatively assess the shape of the surface. This 3D model can be easily viewed from any position and the user can interactively control the scale of the height.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2a</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2b</ref>, selecting a rectangular region is shown. The top images show the boxes defining the areas, while the lower two images show the corresponding height field representations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2c</ref> shows the selection of a region with an arbitrary polygon aligned with a surface feature.</p><p>Computing Surface Normals Surface normal vectors at each sample are derived and a visualization of the distribution of these vectors is displayed. As in the development of region selection techniques, the algorithm used for deriving normal vectors also evolved. At first a simple gradient calculation over nearest neighbor points was used, but it did not yield satisfactory results. There were no clear clusters of normals, which were expected for these crystals. The problem is that a gradient calculation produces an orientation regardless of the quality of the input data, which may suffer from the random or systematic errors mentioned earlier.</p><p>This problem was resolved by determining surface orientation by fitting a plane to an NxN set of samples, where N is a variable set interactively. A normal is accepted by the system only if the RMS deviation from the best-fit plane of the points in this NxN area is below a certain threshold. This "roughness" threshold is also controlled by the user. These parameters are set interactively to obtain an adequate number of normals to establish clusters without admitting erroneous normals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Displaying Surface Normals</head><p>The display of the normal vectors is important because the presence of facets in the sample is expected to be evidenced by closely packed clusters of normals.</p><p>The first attempt to visualize the normals was a display in which all unit normal vectors were displayed in 3D space anchored at the origin <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3a)</ref>. Even with interactive manipulation of the view, this was difficult to understand. We turned instead to a stereographic projection <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3(b)</ref>), which is conventionally used to express the geometry of crystals. In this projection a line segment is drawn from the tip of a unit vector to the point 0; 0; 1. The projection of that vector is the intersection of this line segment with the plane z = 0 . This is well understood by the researchers and is well suited to the visual identification of clusters of normals. The 2D representation also facilitates picking groups of normals for subsequent calculations.</p><p>The display is essentially a scatter plot in which each normal vector is represented by a point on the stereographic projection. We enhanced this traditional representation by coloring the points according to one of two schemes. In the first scheme, each quadrant is assigned a single color. The second scheme assigns hue on the basis of the angular offset from the X axis, and saturation proportional to the angular offset of the normal from the unit Z vector. This can be thought of as a color wheel based scheme.</p><p>Using either scheme, a second 3D surface rendering is made, in which the surface is colored with the same colors that are used for the corresponding normals in the stereographic view. Thus the color of the surface allows the user to relate projected normals to the original surface. This view, shown in the upper right portion of Color Plate 1, is very useful to the researcher; the variation in colors enables the researcher to assess qualitatively the location and orientation of facets.</p><p>Using color to relate the surface to the projected normals is useful in day to day use of the system. It was also invaluable in debugging the module that computes normals. A program just to compute and cluster surface normals could easily be written without visualization. But the colors provide a quick check that the normal vectors are being computed correctly. By leaving points that fail the "roughness" test white, we also check that the curved peaks are indeed being eliminated.</p><p>Several important data structures were used in this implementation. In addition to the stereographic map of normal vectors (represented as a RGB image), the software generates a data array of the same dimensions. For each pixel of the stereographic view, this array stores the sums of the components of the normal vectors and the number of normal vectors mapped to that position. By preserving this original normal information, with weights, the system can accurately calculate an average normal vector for a given cluster on the stereographic view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computing Facet Orientation</head><p>The colored scatter plot reveals clusters of normals that indicate substantial areas with similar orientations. These, of course, are expected to be the facets that are of interest to the researcher. The user can select one of these clusters by interactively drawing a box or polygon on the stereographic view, using the same interaction mechanism used for selecting the area of interest in the original grey scale image. But, like the original view, the stereographic display is simply a static image, and this limits its utility. The user can zoom in on the image, but no additional detail is presented; the pixels are simply enlarged.</p><p>When this normal selection is made, the colored 3D surface is recolored so that areas of the surface whose normals have been selected are colored brighter. This highlights the portions of the surface with the selected orientation and serves as an important verification that the desired facet has been identified and isolated from other parts of the surface. Color Plate 2 shows a selected region in the projected normal image, and the corresponding colored surface.</p><p>Once facets have been selected to the satisfaction of the researcher, the average normal of that facet is calculated and stored in a file. When several facets of the same grain have been stored, the relative angles between the facets can be calculated and reported to the user. These relative angles are critical in understanding the structure of the crystal. This information is used as input to other analysis tools.</p><p>Unsolved Problems Certain problematic aspects of the data have emerged during this visualization effort. Among these are seemingly random noise in the data, scanning artifacts, and distortions due to the AFM tip shape. The "roughness" test eliminates only the grossest distortions caused by tip shape. Other gross scanning artifacts, such as sudden jumps in height between two scan lines, are typically apparent when the data are visualized and areas containing such artifacts can be avoided. However more randomly distributed errors are more difficult to avoid. These errors generate bad normal vectors that can at times still obscure and distort the appearance of the features of interest in the stereographic view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>This system is being used by researchers to interactively view surfaces in a variety of ways and to explore the geometry of the facets. The stated goals have been met:</p><p>identification of surface facets from AFM height data The user can isolate small surface areas in the image and view these areas as height fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>calculation of facet normal vectors and angles between facets</head><p>The system computes facet normals and shows the results in The system is used for qualitative assessment of data and has become useful in understanding the physics of the surfaces. Additionally, the calculated angles between facets are being used in conjunction with other techniques to derive the equilibrium shape of alumina.</p><p>Future enhancements to the system may go in several directions. Additional analysis techniques for understanding the facet geometry may be integrated within this interactive framework. In an effort to correct (rather than simply discard) distortions resulting from the AFM tip shape, an erosion algorithm may be included in the system. Additionally we plan to experiment with implementing the system in another visualization software system to see if the user interface can be futher improved.</p><p>Certainly this software represents a leap in functionality over the previously available tools for analyzing AFM data. The visual depictions are more easily manipulated and the geometry of the surface is more easily understood. Visualizing and interacting with the data in this way leads to greater insight and new questions.</p><p>For related visualization applications, this project offers the following more general insights:</p><p>In performing analysis on an image, too much freedom in selecting a region can be detrimental; sometimes more precise control is needed than is provided by freehand drawing. In analyzing results a scientist often wants to define carefully a region to capture a feature, and/or would like to compare regions of exactly the same extent across the image.</p><p>Care needs to be taken in using "canned" modules for deriving information from data. Built-in operators can easily produce results, but do not take into account application specific information such as the variable reliability of input data. In this case, it is important to account for random and systematic errors by using a custom designed module for calculating normals.</p><p>In presenting data to the scientist, it is useful to start with a form the scientist is used to seeing. In this software, we used the stereographic projection rather than a naive three dimensional representation of the surface normals. Graphics tools can then be used to build on and enhance these traditional presentations. For example, in our system color was used to facilitate user interaction with the projected normals and height field representation of the data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Holly Rushmeier's current affilliation is: IBM TJ Watson ResearchCenter, H0-D06, 30 Saw Mill River Road, Hawthorne, NY 10532</figDesc></figure>
