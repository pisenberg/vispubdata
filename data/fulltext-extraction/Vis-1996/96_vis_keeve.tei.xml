			<abstract>
				<p>Anatomy-based facial tissue modeling for surgical simulation is a field whose time has come. Real-time facial animation has been created in the last few years using models based on the anatomical structure of the human skin. Anatomy-based models are also under development in the field of medical visualization, with which facial surgery can be realistically simulated. In this article we present an anatomy-based 3D finite element tissue model. Integrated into a computer-aided surgical planning system this model allows the precise prediction of soft tissue changes resulting from the realignment of the underlying bone structure. The model has already been used in our Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and has improved craniofacial surgical planning procedures. The model is described in detail and surgical simulation results are shown and discussed.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Computer-aided surgery (CAS) is a relatively new field that has made a great impact in medicine in the last few years <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Specifically, craniofacial surgery has long been an extremely productive application area for the development of computerassisted surgical methods; much of the initial work for reconstruction and visualization of patient anatomy came from this field. However, the current craniofacial surgical simulators leave a number of deficiencies unresolved. The most notable of these are in automated osteotomy selection, considerations of growth and soft tissue prediction. Soft tissue changes which are the result of the displacement of the underlying bone structure during craniofacial surgery, are not taken into account in most existing surgical simulators. Prediction of tissue changes is still based on empirical studies of the relationship between bone and tissue movements. There is no model of facial tissue that allows realistic simulation of tissue changes resulting from replacement of the underlying bone structure. This leads to only a limited prediction of the patient's postoperative appearance.</p><p>In 1993, David Altobelli and Ron Kikinis presented a new method to predict soft tissue changes considering displacements of the underlying bones <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. They estimated skin changes based on ratios between bone and tissue movements which can be found in the orthognathic literature. A Craniofacial Surgery Simulation Testbed was developed by Hervé Delingette in 1994, using deformable surfaces and volumes called Simplex Meshes to simulate surface changes such as those exerted on the facial skin under the action of muscles <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. This approach does not consider the exact anatomical structure of the tissue; instead the user specifies muscles which define the connection between the facial skin and the underlying bone. In 1996, Rolf Koch and Markus Gross presented a new approach to realistically predict soft tissue changes after facial surgery using finite element models <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Using advanced modeling and animation systems such as Alias and AVS, this new and innovative approach has currently not been applied to individual patient data, but instead uses the Visible Human Project dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Furthermore the tissue model is built with only a 2D finite element mesh describing the patient's skin -the underlying tissue is modeled using a mass spring approach, which cannot describe the exact nonlinear physical behaviour of human tissue.</p><p>In previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, we described a computer-aided surgical planning system which uses a mass spring tissue model to predict the patient's appearance after craniofacial surgery. This model has been used for a few case studies at our Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and we compared the simulation results with the postoperative situations. We found that the mass spring tissue model gives good and interactive first impressions of the patient's postoperative appearance. However, as mentioned before, such a mass spring tissue model cannot describe the exact physical behaviour of human tissue. Therefore, we have extended our computer-aided surgical planning system with a 3D finite element model to capture the exact elastomechanics of the patient's skin and tissue. In this paper we present this new 3D finite element tissue model which can be easily applied to individual anatomical structures. The new tissue model is integrated into our computer-aided surgical planning system and allows a precise preoperative three-dimensional visualization of the patient's appearance after craniofacial surgery. This model has also been used for a few case studies at our Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and will be verified comparing the simulation results with actual postoperative findings.</p><p>The organization of this paper is as follows: First, in section 2, we give a short overview of our computer-aided surgical planning system. Section 2.1 describes the data acquisition and visualization. In section 2.2 we elaborate the simulation of bone realignment. Section 3 reviews the 3D finite element tissue model we employ. In section 3.1 we describe a generic facial mesh which is used to map general anatomical attributes to the individual patient data. Section 3.2 illustrates the 3D finite element mesh generation in detail. Section 3.3 illuminates the finite element processing steps which are necessary to initialize the model, to solve the finite element formulation and to re-integrate the calculated tissue displacements into the model. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency and strength of this new approach with one of our case studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">SURGICAL PLANNING SYSTEM</head><p>As stated, the focus of this paper is the 3D finite element tissue model described in detail in section 3. Therefore, this section elucidates only briefly the general setup of our computeraided surgical planning system, the data acquisition and visualization and the simulation of bone realignment. For a detailed description of the system see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The surgical planning system is implemented in C++ on Silicon Graphics workstations, using the object-oriented graphics library Open Inventor. Each feature has its own Motif dialog window which gives the physicians the flexibility to easily tailor parameters to suit the needs of their application. The whole surgical planning process consists of one complex application -no additional other programs needed to be used. This makes the handling of the surgical planning procedure straightforward.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Data Acquisition and Visualization</head><p>The Marching Cubes method is used to reconstruct the skull from computer tomography. This 3D skull reconstruction provides the basis for the interactive simulation of the bone realignment, as described in Section 2.2. A Cyberware laser scanner obtains the geometry and color information of the patient's skin surface. After data acquisition, an improved version of William Schröder's adaptive reduction technique is used to decrease the size of both datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. This compression algorithm reduces the amount of triangles used to represent complex anatomical structures up to 80 % without sacrificing the visible detail of the objects. A semi-automatic method registers the skin and skull data, which are obtained in different coordinate systems. During the 3D cephalometric analysis the user provides corresponding anatomical points in both datasets. A matrix is calculated by least squares fitting, which transforms the data from one coordinate system to the other. A Snake-based approach is currently under investigation, which performs facial feature extraction and allows a fully automatic registration. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1a</ref> shows the Marching Cubes reconstruction of the patient's skull. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1b</ref>, a 3D Cephalometry tool allows the physician to easily measure the exact anatomical structure of the patient's skull and skin. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1c and 1d</ref> illustrate the Viewing Plane tool that can be used to generate a section at an arbitrary angle and visualize particular structures of interest -a volume-rendered image is used as a reference for a more detailed structure localization. The system also supports visualization of the scene in stereo. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1e</ref>, the Implant Carving tool can be used to model a custom prosthesis with a desired shape. To verify the tissue model, a Verification tool as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1f</ref>, is used to visualize the shape differences in the simulation with respect to the actual postoperative finding. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Realignment of Bone</head><p>In order to perform the surgical planning, the bone realignments are first simulated. Afterwards, the ensuing tissue changes are calculated with respect to these bone realignments by the 3D finite element tissue model described in section 3.</p><p>In contrast to other surgical simulation systems that allow only predetermined surgical procedures, our system provides the flexibility to apply any craniofacial operation on the bone structure and manipulate it at will. These changes are made with a Cutting Plane which splits the bone in half. After the split, each bone segment is defined as a unique object that can be further manipulated. The Cutting Plane can be changed in shape and orientation to enable the simulation of different procedures. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the simulation of a Dal-Pont osteotomy, which splits the ascending branches of the mandible. The interactive simulation is analogous to a real operation. To the lingual (inner) side of the ascending branch a horizontal cut is applied which divides the lower jaw as far as the middle. On the vestibular (outer) side a vertical cut is performed half-way through the bone. Then a sagittal cut splits the bone lengthwise in half. With an object manipulation tool, the now-separated frontal mandible is pushed backwards to correctly align it with the maxilla. These steps can be accomplished on a common graphics workstation, like a SGI High Impact, in approximately 10 minutes. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">3D FINITE ELEMENT MODEL</head><p>Anatomy-based models have been developed in different fields of medicine to simulate the physical behaviour of human soft tissue and skeleton. The goal of these efforts is the computer-based realistic simulation of the soft tissue or skeleton deformation, such as in minimally invasive, plastic or craniofacial surgery. The basis of these models is often the finite element method <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> which is a fundamental technique in engineering and is being increasingly applied in the field of computer graphics and animation. The idea of the finite element method is that a continuum is approximated by dividing it into a mesh of discrete elements. Different element types are appropriate for different applications and therefore many element types have been proposed. These elements are defined by the number of their nodes and their geometry. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows some examples. Several finite element techniques exist -in our application the displacement-based finite element approach is used. Given displacements are specified for certain nodes which cause strain. This strain is related to stress through a specified formulation -e.g. in a linearly elastic case through Hooke's law. The strain in turn creates internal forces. In order to bring these forces into equilibrium, a system of differential equations is solved delivering the displacements of the unconstrained nodes.  To create the 3D finite element tissue model, we first map a generic facial mesh to the individual patient data as described in section 3.1. Then we construct the 3D finite element mesh including tissue properties and boundary conditions, as shown in section 3.2. The finite element formulation used is described in detail in section 3.3. Section 3.4 deals with the implementation of this new model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Generic Facial Mesh</head><p>The first step of our approach to construct an anatomy-based finite element tissue model is to map a generic facial mesh containing anatomical attributes to the patient's data. The generic facial mesh is obtained once by a Cyberware laser scanner. The mesh is reduced using an adaptive reduction technique described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4c</ref>, a interactive 3D paint program is used to assign different anatomical attributes to different regions of the generic facial mesh. Special procedures allow the user to easily manipulate the geometry and topology of the mesh. For example, in the original dataset the upper and lower lips are not separated topologically; this can be specified by adding a lineset to the generic facial mesh <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 4d</ref>). The advantage of the generic facial mesh is that it has well-defined features and attributes which can be mapped to individual patient data. The mapping is done by indicating feature nodes in both datasets and using an adaptation technique described in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> -see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure  4e</ref>. As a result, the attributes given by the generic facial mesh can be used to create an anatomy-based individual patient tissue model. For example, one attribute describes how the patient's skin data are connected to the patient's skull data. The generation of the patient's 3D finite element tissue mesh is described in detail in section 3.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Mesh Generation</head><p>To build a regular 3D finite element mesh we use the six-node prism element shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5a</ref>. Depending on the Connection attribute defined by the generic mesh, we establish a connection for each skin vertex to the underlying skull. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5b</ref>, we project the skin vertex towards a userspecified point e.g. the center of gravity of the patient's data. The first intersection with the skull provides the corresponding point for the prism element. If no intersection is found, a point is automatically generated by interpolating the distances between the skin and the corresponding skull vertices of the adjacent elements. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figures 5c  and 5d</ref>, this technique creates non-degenerated prism elements with respect to the attributes given by the generic facial mesh. For some specified facial regions the prism elements are not fixed to the patient skull, so there are no boundary conditions for these elements. In order to apply the bone realignment to the finite element model we integrate the intersection points into the skull data.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Finite Element Formulation</head><p>Experimental results have shown that living biological tissue has a non-linear, viscoelastic stress-strain relationship as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The history of strain affects the stress, which means that the stress-strain relations in the loading and unloading processes are different. Each branch of a specific cyclic process can be described by a non-linear pseudo-elastic function. Since the differences are insignificant, we describe the tissue by one non-linear elastic function, which simplifies the computation. For experimental reasons we first implemented a linear elastic function to describe the tissue behaviour as shown in section 3.3.1. This simplification provides first impressions and gives us experience with the finite element model. In section 3.3.2 we then describe a non-linear elastic approach on which we are currently working and which will improve our model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Linear Formulation</head><p>Our linear elastic model is achieved by the general elasticity equilibrium equation as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. See Appendix A for a detailed mathematical description. We neglect the effect of body forces and get the linear system Kx = b <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where x is the displacement vector and b is the nodal load vector. The coefficient matrix K is a nd by nd nonsymmetric matrix -d is the number of space dimensions and n is the number of nodes per element (in our case d = 3 and n = 6). The boundary conditions of the system are given by the skull vertices which belong to the finite element mesh -see section 3.2. These vertices are partially displaced by the bone realignment procedure. Solving the linear system we receive the displacements for all skin and skull nodes of the finite element mesh. These displacements are re-integrated into our surgical planning system and the tissue changes are visualized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Non-Linear Formulation</head><p>In order to get a more realistic model of the elastomechanics we are currently working on a non-linear tissue model using the principal of Virtual Displacements described by the Total Lagrange Formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. See Appendix B for a detailed mathematical description. Using the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor and the Green-Lagrange strain tensor, a linear approximation of the Total Lagrange Formulation can be stated. With a modified Newton Iteration a solution of this approximation can be formed. The finite element formulation for this modified Newton Iteration is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">0 t K L + 0 t K NL ( )∆U ( i) = t +∆t R− 0 t +∆t F (i −1 )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where KL and KNL are the incremental stiffness matrices for linear and non-linear strain, while vector ∆U <ref type="bibr">(i)</ref> represents the incremental nodal displacements at iteration i. R denotes the exterior nodal loads and F (i-1) the nodal forces at iteration i-1 which correspond to the element stresses. Equation (2) can be solved using a Strain Energy Function W, which provides the following relationship between stress and strain</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">0 t S ij = ∂W ∂ 0 t ε ij<label>(3)</label></formula><p>with Sij as the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor and εij as the Green-Lagrange strain tensor. For two-dimensional tissue modeling, the Strain Energy Function W is given by Yuan-Cheng Fung <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. We have already implemented the nonlinear finite element model and are currently working on the three-dimensional Strain Energy Function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Implementation</head><p>The implementation of the model is based on the finite element library Diffpack <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. We have developed an interface between our computer-aided surgical planning system and this finite element library. The interface provides Diffpack with the 3D tissue model, which includes element coordinates, their boundary conditions and their given displacements due to bone realignment. In our first application, we assume the stress-strain relationship to be linearly elastic. As mentioned in section 3.3, human tissue is actually non-linearly elastic and we are currently working on a non-linear formulation to improve our model. With the 3D tissue mesh given by the interface and the finite element formulation Diffpack sets up a system of equations and solves it, providing the final displacements. These displacements are read back into the surgical planning system and the resulting tissue changes are visualized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">RESULTS</head><p>To demonstrate the efficiency of the 3D finite element model we use a case study where the mandible was split, moved backward and pushed to the right. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 7a</ref> for the preoperative bone structure and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 7b</ref> for the simulated bone realignment. We used the linear formulation and 2,583 six-node prism elements. It took 47 seconds to set up the initial configuration using a SGI High Impact workstation. The finite element calculations were done in 10.7 minutes. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure  7c</ref> shows the patient's skin before surgery and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 7d</ref> the finite element simulation. The actual postoperative finding is given for purposes of comparison in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 7e</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have presented an anatomy-based 3D finite element tissue model which allows the precise prediction of tissue changes according to the realignment of the underlying bone structure. Our model is based on CT volume data and laser scans. We use a generic facial mesh to map general anatomical structures to the individual patient data. Using this information, we create a 3D finite element model which is currently based on a linear formulation. To improve this approach a non-linear formulation is under development.
