<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Management of environmental quality requires analyses of complex processes which often defy direct insight. The field of "environmental modeling" has evolved to aid in the analysis of complex air and water pollution problems.</p><p>A numerical model should yield output that agrees with observations. Comparative visualization of observations and model output presents multiple challenges due to the fact that the observations, sparsely scattered in space and time, generally do not coincide with the locations and time steps for which model output is given. We do not re-sample model output and observations onto one grid; the necessary interpolation might lead to false impressions when comparing model results and observations.</p><p>An ongoing study of the Chesapeake Bay presents an ideal study for research in 3D visualization of model-data comparisons. The model <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> simulates 22 environmental parameters, e.g., salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. Computations are made on a 3D grid containing approximately 4,000 grid cells. Typical simulations encompass one year and produce approximately 17,000,000 computations of each variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Visualization Software</head><p>We have extended SCIRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for model-data comparisons. SCIRT assumed that data sets were given on structured, rectilinear grids, but it has been extended to support curvilinear coordinates. Visualization techniques include Cutting Planes, Minicubes, and Point Clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. SCIRT creates look-up tables for various color maps during initialization and function values are linearly interpolated. The histogram of the data is superimposed on the color map.</p><p>Whereas parameter values in the original SCIRT system are associated with grid points, the parameter values for the ChesapeakeBay</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Underlying Structure</head><p>The model output is given for curvilinear, hexahedral cells Cijk <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. A cell's data, associated with its centroid, is a vectorvalued parameter Fijkl associated with Cijk and time step tl (in Julian days). The coordinates are longitude, latitude, and depth. Only one of the constituents of Fijkl is shown at time step .</p><p>The observations are scattered throughout the Bay for specific times. Parameters are measured at various depth levels along a probe specified by a longitude-latitude pair and time value. A "probe file" specifies one of the constituents of a vector-valued parameter.</p><p>When a model output file for time step is read, the corresponding constituent's "probe file" is read in. Only probes lying in the userspecified time interval [ ; + ] are considered.</p><p>After the probe files are read, one determines the grid cells containing probe data based on the cell's Jacobian <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. When a cell is found, its index is stored with the probe datum and the datum's associated u; v; w parameter tuple is used to compute a weight based on spatial distance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Rendering Techniques</head><p>There are three principal techniques for rendering the probes: displaying probe outlines, displaying points along a probe, and displaying cells containing at least one probe datum and their observed, weighted data. One can combine these techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Probe Outlines</head><p>The probe outlines are squares swept in the depth "direction" for a particular longitude/latitude location. The square is swept from the probe's minimum to maximum depth with a cross section at each datum's depth.</p><p>Since the time steps used in the numerical simulation do not agree with the times associated with observations, we use a color scheme to indicate "time distance" when rendering model output and observations simultaneously. Probes with time values coinciding with a model's time step are white. Observations collected before have a higher blue component; those collected after have a higher red component. The colors range from white to blue (or red) using a banded color map.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Probe Points</head><p>The probe points are rendered as cubes with color representing parameter values. A white line is drawn through the cubes to indicate connectivity.</p><p>Some probes have a longitude/latitude measurement that does not lie inside any cell data grid approximating the Bay's shape. Furthermore, some probe points have a depth value greater than that of the numerical model. In order to show this inconsistency, we have implemented a scheme that displays only those points lying within a cell <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 2)</ref>.</p><p>Another method shows the probe points as well as the outlines. This method aids the user in determining which probe corresponds to which time step <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 3)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Cell Probes</head><p>Whereas the previous techniques focus on displaying the probes, this technique is better suited to allow comparison between probe data and model output. A cell containing at least one probe datum is rendered as a wireframe, colored with respect to its simulated data value and the colormap. The probe data in a cell are weighted and a weighted average is displayed at the centroid of the cell; its size and shape is determined by the number of points within the cell and its color is determined by the weighted average <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 4)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Probe Data Shape and Size</head><p>There may be many points that lie within a single cell. Since it is important to know how many probe data are used to compute the average over a cell, this number is indicated. We use icons <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to do so since the color is dedicated to the function value. For cells containing less than six points, we use flat-shaded hexahedra, scaled with   respect to the number of points. For cells containing between six and ten points, we use scaled octahedra. For cells containing more than ten points, we use scaled, hollow cylinders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">Function values as weighted averages</head><p>Since there can be multiple probe data in a single cell, function averaging schemes have been developed. We use three weighting schemes: averaging, temporal weighting, and spatial weighting. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5a</ref> and 5b illustrate the first two schemes. The first scheme simply averages the data, i.e., The second scheme weights the data with respect to its distance from the time step, i.e., The third scheme is a 3D analog of the second scheme, where a datum at the centroid of a cube has weight one and data at the cube's vertices have weight zero (using a trilinear weight variation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.3">The Difference Method</head><p>Rather than letting the icon's color represent the function value, we let it represent the (absolute) difference. We compute the difference between the cell-averaged observational data and the model output, divided by the maximum difference. The great advantage of this rendering method is that the user can clearly see the regions where model output and observations strongly agree or disagree <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6)</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>All of the described methods can be used concurrently with Cutting Planes and Volume Rendering techniques. Cutting Planes works well with any method. Volume rendering techniques (Minicubes and Point Clouds) tend to obscure the probes; this can be rectified by using transparency <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 7)</ref> or by reducing the size of the volume primitives. Generally, only a few files are read in at a time so the resulting picture is not too crowded and the probes are close (with respect to time) to the time step.</p><p>This program, developed on an SGI Indigo 2 Extreme workstation with a 150 MHz processor and 64 Mbytes of main memory, renders the data in real time, considering all rendering methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Future Work</head><p>Observed data might actually deviate a lot from a few, isolated simulated values. Nevertheless, due to the nature of averaging, this might not be evident in a rendering, thus giving a false impression of agreement. Therefore, we plan to add more comparitive methods, such as displaying the maximum absolute deviation of simulated values from known probe data, or the interval that the probe data in a single cell range over.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Scaled Point Clouds visualized with clipped probe points.</figDesc></figure>
