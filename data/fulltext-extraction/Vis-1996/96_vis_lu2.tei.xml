				<p>In many mechanical design-related activities, a visualization tool needs to convey not only the shape of the objects, but also their interior problem regions. Due t o the binary nature of these models, existing shading models often fall short of supporting a realistic display. In this case study, we present several new contextual shading methods that we originally developed for our design visualization tools. The results are then compared with gray-scale shading applied to a gray-level version of the binary object. The comparison shows that our method can be applied to any binary object and yields promising results.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Over the past decade, volume-based representations have been very popular in the areas of graphics and imaging because of the proliferation of multi-dimensional data sets and advances in related technologies. Recently, they have even been adopted in the fields of mechanical design and manufacturing for many of their applications (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lu et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Lee et al., 1994)</ref>. This is because voxel models have the unique advantage of being able to model not only the surface but also the interior of an object explicitly. The latter simplifies the extraction of volumerelated geometric characteristics.</p><p>In addition, the uniformity makes it especially beneficial for applications that involve complex geometries. These properties have facilitated the development of design tools hitherto not possible.</p><p>In those design-related applications, the volume i s usually obtained through voxelization of synthesized objects. Due to the binary nature of those models (too expensive to generate fuzzy models), the commonly used shading methods developed for scanned data, e.g. graylevel shading <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Hohne, 1986)</ref>, cannot be directly applied. Especially for our application, i.e. manufacturability evaluation, not only must the outer surface of the object be displayed, but also the interior problem regions. Hence, for the designer to perceive the information correctly, it i s necessary to develop binary object shading methods that can support realistic display of these complex geometries as well as provide a 3-D perspective of their problem regions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">PRESENTATION OF THE ANALYSIS R E S U L T S</head><p>In an earlier paper, we presented a volume-based approach for manufacturability evaluation in die casting <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Lu et al. 1995)</ref>. This approach can systematically identify pertinent geometric characteristics that often cause manufacturing defects by using a binary voxel model and its distance transform. Specifically, the heavy sections can be identified by extracting voxels with relatively large distance values because they are farther away from the part boundary. The results are then presented through a specifically tailored visualization system that facilitates comprehension of the problems.</p><p>To better present the analysis results, as a part of this research we developed a three-layer-scheme in which the part voxels are divided into three different layers. The skin layer contains the voxels on the boundary of the part and i s usually one or two voxels thick. These voxels are assigned a gray color, and a see-through opacity to provide a 3-D perspective of the object. The second layer, i.e. the highlighted core layer, consists of the voxels with the characteristics of interest, i.e. the problem regions. These voxels are opaque and are assigned a red color. All the other voxels of the part constitute the intermediate layer, and are totally transparent. This scheme is analogous t o viewing a part design whose boundary is made of glass, and whose problem regions are embedded within.</p><p>During the scan conversion process, normal vectors for the voxels of the skin layer will be inherited from the polygon model. By explicitly rendering those outer surface voxels with the nearly-correct normal vectors, the shape of the object can be better perceived. However, in this scheme, the one missing ingredient is a method to estimate the normals for the problem regions. In addition, there may be cases where the normal vectors are not embedded in the voxel model itself. Thus, an efficient binary shading model is essential to conveying both the position and shape of the object and its problem regions to designers so that design decisions can be made based on them.</p><p>In the following, we discuss a few existing shading methods, and the problems using them for our application. We then present a new contextual shading method that can be efficiently used to address these problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PREVIOUS METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Depth-Gradient</head><p>Depth gradient is a shading method that is commonly used for binary models <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Gordon and Reynolds, 1985)</ref>. In this model, the normal vector at any visible surface voxel i s computed based on the gradients of the depth values of its four neighboring screen pixels. It is an image space shading model and thus the results are sometimes of poor quality due to the lack of a third dimension. In our application, template-based ray casting is used to expedite the rendering process <ref type="bibr">(Yagel and Kaufman l992)</ref>. Since the rays are shot from the base plane rather than the screen, depth information is not readily available. In this case, the processing overhead makes it difficult to justify its use i n our application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Normal-based Contextual Shading</head><p>The basic idea behind contextual shading is t o determine the surface inclination of a voxel based on the pattern of surface voxels in the neighborhood. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Chen et al. (1985)</ref> proposed a normal-based contextual shading model which is based on a cuberille volume representation. The normal vector at any voxel is estimated based on the voxel face and its four adjacent faces. Since only a fixed number of voxel face patterns can appear in a small neighborhood, the normal vectors can be pre-calculated and stored in a lookup table. This model results in only 25 distinct normals <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Kaufman, 1990)</ref> which, in general, is not sufficient t o adequately display complex geometries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Hohne (1986)</ref> proposed another object space shading model which uses gray-scale gradients as a measure of the normal vectors. This algorithm uses the central difference i n a voxel neighborhood to approximate the partial gradient and uses this as a measure of surface inclination. Gray-scale shading produces a large, dynamic range of normal vectors, and can also support voxel semi-transparency. However, the basic assumption of this algorithm is that the object being rendered exhibits a "partial volume effect". Hence, i n general, this algorithm is not applicable to binary voxel models. In our application, where the distance transform i s available for the voxels of the volume, this approach is still not fully applicable. For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows a 2-D cross section and part of their distance transform. If the core value is set to 5, it can be seen that the gray-scale method gives us two different normals for cases (A) and (B), even though they should have the same normals. In fact, when 6distance, i.e. city-block distance, is used for the distance transformation, the number of normal vectors resulting from this algorithm are rather limited. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Gray-Scale Gradient</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">NEW 3-D CONTEXTUAL SHADING M E T H O D</head><p>As stated above, existing shading methods are not suited to presentation of manufacturing defects internal t o the part such as heavy mass regions. The depth-based shading methods are too cumbersome to use with templatebased ray casting algorithms and are not accurate enough. The normal-based contextual shading proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Chen et al. (1985)</ref> can only support a very limited domain of normals. On the other hand, Hohne's gray-scale shading (1986) is very sensitive to the distribution of the distance values in the sub-surface layer.</p><p>Accordingly, we developed a new 3-D contextual shading method that overcomes these problems, and can be applied to the shading of binary voxel models.</p><p>An ideal contextual shading method for binary voxel models would involve hard coding a lookup table containing the normal vectors associated with all possible voxel configurations in a small neighborhood. In 3-D, if we restrict ourselves to 3x3x3, this table will contain 2 26 entries, which is not practical.</p><p>In our approach, we use a divide and conquer strategy to handle the unmanageably large number of configurations.</p><p>It involves representing the 3x3x3 neighborhood by three orthogonal planes, each with nine voxels. Since each plane will then have 3x3=9 entries, the 2-D normals of these 256 possible patterns can be computed and coded into a look-up table. At run time, the normals from the three orthogonal planes are then combined to form the final normal. When building a normal table i n the context of 2-D, there are many cases where the normal i s not obvious. In those cases multiple normals are encoded and the appropriate one chosen based on the quadrant of the viewing direction. Furthermore, to account for the influence of the vertex-adjacent voxels in the 3x3x3 neighborhood that have been neglected in the use of the 3 orthogonal planes, vectors diagonal to the 3x3x3 cube and originating from each occupied corner voxel are added together. The resultant is then normalized and added with the three normalized vectors obtained for the orthogonal planes. In this research, we also tried to improve the results by increasing the size of the neighborhood to 5x5x5. Like the 3x3x3 case, we model the 5x5x5 neighborhood by 3 orthogonal planes. However, since each plane contains 5x5=25 entries, creating a look-up table for all 2 24 patterns are still impractical. Our strategy, therefore, is to reduce the number of patterns by systematic elimination of the entries that have little effect on the normal. In particular, since the normal is affected solely by the surface voxels, we can neglect all interior points. For each open direction, the 5x5 plane is then divided into five 5x1 columns that are parallel to that open direction. Each column is then traversed from the open direction to find the first surface voxel encountered. If a surface voxel is encountered in a column, it has at most 5 possible locations, or the surface does not pass through the column. Since only the first surface voxel of each of the 5 columns is used, the number of possible patterns is reduced to 6 5 =7776.</p><p>Even though this is a large number, many cases can be neglected. For example, since the center voxel of the 5x5 neighborhood lies on the surface, the first surface voxel i n the center column cannot possibly be located beyond the center voxel. This effectively reduces in half the total number of possible patterns. In addition, if there are n o surface voxels in the second or fourth column, the surface must be practically parallel to the length of the columns s o any surface voxels in the first or fifth column respectively have no influence on the normal and can be neglected. Therefore, the effective number of combinations for the 5x5 plane is reduced to less than 1000. Based on this reduced set, a normal lookup table can be constructed with little effort.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">RESULTS</head><p>Figures 4,5, and 7 show the images rendered using the newly developed contextual shading methods. These results are compared with polygon model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3)</ref> and a gray-scale gradient shading applied to the gray-level version of the object <ref type="figure">(Figure 6</ref>). This fuzzy object i s generated by applying a 5x5x5 Gaussian filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Russ, 1995)</ref> to the original binary object so it is very time consuming. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 8-10</ref> show the difference between these images and the image generated with the polygon normals. The colors in order of increasing error, in these figures, are white (prediction is the same), bright green, dark green, yellow and red. The mean error and standard deviation are also shown in the figures in terms of angles. As can be seen from the figures, though all of the methods produce promising results, the 3x3x3 contextual shading with the corner effects is slightly better than the others, including the gray-level object. It is probably because the 3x3x3 contextual takes care of all the ambiguous cases. Since these new contextual methods can display an object practically in real time, they have a significant advantage over the filter-based approaches. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The Problems with Gray-Scale Shading of Voxel Model with Distance Transform</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The first task involves finding the voxels that have the most significant effect on the surface inclination.To accomplish this, the open direction(s) of a voxel are found based on whether it is a North, South, East, West, Front or Back border point, i.e. its North, South, East or West neighbors are unoccupied. A direction X of a voxel is open if it belongs to the class of X-border points but not to its converse. For example, if the central voxel is a South border point but not a North border point, then the South is an open direction as shown in figure 2. If, on the other hand, the central voxel is both a South border point and a North border point, then neither North nor South is an opendirection. If all of its 4-connected neighbors are occupied, then the 8-neighbors will be checked. However, if all 8neighbors are occupied, the contribution of that plane t o the voxel normal is neglected.</figDesc></figure>
