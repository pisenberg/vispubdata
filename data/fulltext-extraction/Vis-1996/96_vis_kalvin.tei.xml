			<abstract>
				<p>We describe an ongoing project that is using visualization as a indispensable tool for the restoration of the disintegrated ceiling of a ritual precinct that was recently discovered during archaeological excavations of a group of pre-Inca temples in Peru. This ceiling is unique-it is the only one ever found that has pictures painted on it, rather than being simply whitewashed. The restoration of the ceiling, and the recovery of these iconographic figures will provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the culture of the Moche people who build and used these temples.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">The Moche civilization and the excavations at El Brujo</head><p>At the archaeological site of El Brujo (The Sorcerer) on the coast of northern Peru, a major excavation of a temple building belonging to the Moche people of ancient Peru in currently under way. The Moche, who occupied this region of Northern Peru between the first and eighth centuries A.D. were highly advanced both technologically and artistically. They built sophisticated irrigation canal systems, pyramids, and palaces, are produced artisans highly skilled in ceramics, metallurgy, and weaving. In about A.D. 800, the Moche society suddenly disappeared, for reasons that are still unknown. Although the Moche civilization existed for a much longer period than that of the Incas (approx. 1450-1600 A.D.), we know far less about them. Firstly, the Moche had no writing system and thus left no written record. Second, because they had already disappeared by the arrival of the Spaniards the 16th century, there are no no first-hand European accounts of the Moche such as those that provide much of our current knowledge about the civilization of the Incas. Therefore the archaeological investigation of the artistic record of their activities, environment, and supernatural realm, plays a crucial role in our understanding of Moche civilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Huaca Cao Viejo</head><p>The temple under excavation, called Huaca Cao Viejo, is one of three stepped pyramids built out of sun-dried bricks at the El Brujo site. It has strong religious connotations within the development of the Moche culture. Depictions of many of the ritual activities that took place in such temples are frequently found in Moche ceramic designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Within the temple, archaeologists have uncovered the remains of a ritual enclosure (or precinct). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows an artist's rendering of a region inside the original temple, with the man on the left standing inside the ritual precinct. The walls of this precinct are beautifully decorated with small high-relief figures. These designs correspond to figures, actions and themes, with special importance given to scenes of navigation and fishing, human sacrifices, martial conflicts, human figures related to the cosmic world, mythical animals, shamans (medicine men), stellar figures and warriors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The precinct ceiling</head><p>The ceiling is the focus of great archaeological interest, since it is the only one of its kind know to have figures painted on it. Unfortunately, it has not fared as well over time as the precinct walls. At some point in the past it collapsed and broke apart. The remains that have been recovered consist of about 3,000 pieces. Some pieces are big (10 x 15 cm. -i.e. about 4 x 6 inches), some are as small as thumb-nail, but the majority of pieces are about the size of a fist. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows some relatively well-preserved pieces from the ceiling.</p><p>Based on the evidence recovered so far, we hypothesize that this precinct was used as a sacrificial altar, and that the figures on the two walls and ceiling represent part of a belief system, or religious speeches that were transmitted by a priest from the adjoining platform.</p><p>We believe that the figures on the walls and ceiling, form a unified iconographic narrative, depicting mythical scenes which represent particular aspects of the cosmogony and cosmology (i.e. the origin and structure) of the religious Mochica universe.</p><p>The restoration of the ceiling and its paintings is essential for a complete and a meaningful interpretation of this narrative. Decoding and understanding it will greatly increase current knowledge of the Moche culture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">A Visualization-based approach to restoring the ceiling</head><p>Our primary motivation for developing a computer-assisted visualization system for restoring the temple ceiling is that a physical restoration is virtually impossible. The large number of pieces, the extensive erosion of their edges, and their fragile condition (they crumble very easily when handled) rule out the idea of laying them out on the ground and putting them together like a giant jig-saw puzzle.</p><p>Further, manipulating digitized versions of the pieces on a computer monitor allows us to test potential matchings and arrangements of pieces rapidly and precisely.</p><p>We have designed this system to enhance the traditional way that archaeologists restore paintings. Our aim is to put a powerful tool in the hands of restoration experts, rather than to attempt automating the restoration process. Accordingly, we have been working very closely with the restorers from El Brujo.</p><p>Initially we began working with a sample of 218 pieces that appear to have come from a common region of the ceiling. Because of the delicate condition of the pieces, they were digitized on-site, using an HP ScanJet 4c document scanner attached to an IBM Aptiva.</p><p>The scanned images were shipped to Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru (PUCP) in Lima where they were preprocessed on a PC using Adobe PhotoShop and then moved to an IBM RS/6000 workstation for matching and manipulation using programs we have built with IBM Visualization Data Explorer visualization toolkit.</p><p>The restorers can rapidly experiment with candidate matches between pieces using a "what-if" spreadsheet type of approach. This matching and alignment of the pieces is based on a database of piece features that contains the following information.</p><p>Colors: The Moche used 9 basic colors in their paintings. Each ceiling piece can have any combination of these colors. Interpretations: These are the possible interpretations of the fragments of figures on a piece (e.g. fox, crown, king, face, crab, snake). Texture: Each piece is classified as rough, smooth or both. Repainted: Some pieces were repainted before the ceiling collapsed. This is indicated by multiple layers of paint. Cane markings: the back side of each piece contains several parallel grooves made by the cane poles used in the constructioj of the ceiling (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>).</p><p>To select a set of pieces for a candidate match the archaeologist uses a Data Explorer "Feature Selection" control panel <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4)</ref> to make a request such as: "Find all pieces that have the colors red, blue and black, have fragmentary details of a fox and a snake, have a rough texture, and were repainted". The user can then rapidly fine-tune the matching results by modifying the selection criteria. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> shows a Data Explorer Image window with a set of selected pieces. Once a set of pieces has been selected, they are aligned onscreen. The orientation and thickness of the cane markings are used to guide and confirm possible alignments. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> shows a set of selected pieces about to be aligned -the red lines depict the cane marks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Work in progress</head><p>We have now completed the first stage of this project, the digitization of the sample of 218 digitized pieces, and the design of the matching and alignment processes. We have also used our experience working with this set of 218 pieces to develop the protocol used for digitizing all 3,000 pieces. We are currently working on the second phase of this project, which consist of: Scanning of all 3,000 and scaling up of the selection and matching tools accordingly. Filling in missing regions of the ceilings. Unfortunately, the 3,000 pieces discovered make up just 30-50% of the original ceiling. Fortunately, since Moche iconography is highly stylized, this is not as bad as it sounds. It is often possible to make interpretations of figures based on partial details. Therefore we are reasonably confident that this fragmentary restoration will be adequate for a comprehensive interpretation of the narrative depicted on the ceiling and walls of the precinct. Nevertheless, we still would like to fill in the missing regions to recreate the ceiling imagery completely. To this end, we are digitizing figures from the precinct walls and from Moche ceramics, which we will use, either directly, or as flexible templates for restoring missing sections. Restoring the paintings on the pieces to their original colors. The paint on the ceiling pieces has faded with time and exposure to the elements. A highly contentious issue in archaeology is whether to restore archaeological artifacts to their original state, or to preserve them as they have been found. By working with electronic pieces we have the liberty of choosing both options.      </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>An artist's rendering of the region inside the original temple containing the ritual precinct.</figDesc></figure>
