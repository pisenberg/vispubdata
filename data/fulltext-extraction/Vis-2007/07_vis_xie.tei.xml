				<p>Conveying shape using feature lines is an important visualization tool in visual computing. The existing feature lines (e.g., ridges, valleys, silhouettes, suggestive contours, etc.) are solely determined by local geometry properties (e.g., normals and curvatures) as well as the view position. This paper is strongly inspired by the observation in human vision and perception that a sudden change in the luminance plays a critical role to faithfully represent and recover the 3D information. In particular, we adopt the edge detection techniques in image processing for 3D shape visualization and present Photic Extremum Lines (PELs) which emphasize significant variations of illumination over 3D surfaces. Comparing with the existing feature lines, PELs are more flexible and offer users more freedom to achieve desirable visualization effects. In addition, the user can easily control the shape visualization by changing the light position, the number of light sources, and choosing various light models. We compare PELs with the existing approaches and demonstrate that PEL is a flexible and effective tool to illustrate 3D surface and volume for visual computing.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Throughout history and technological evolution, scientific illustration has been widely used to depict the most salient features for scientific data in an accurate and intuitive way. Knowledge of human cognition shows that, so frequently an artistic drawing or painting of a same scene is proved to be both more effective in communication and more pleasing in visual experience than a photograph <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> [33] <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. This is mainly because of the abstraction nature of various artistic styles. Among various techniques used in scientific illustration, line drawings have been proven to be an effective and commonly-used way to achieve this goal because they have the capability to display information more efficiently by ignoring less important details. By taking advantage of human visual acuity, line drawings can represent a large amount of information in a relatively succinct manner, which enables them to be more expressive than photographs <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>In graphics and visualization, extensive research has been carried out in computer-generated illustration with different types of feature lines. So far, the commonly-used feature lines on 3D shapes, e.g., contours (the external and internal silhouettes), ridge-valley lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, suggestive contours <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, are solely defined by local geometrical properties, such as surface normal and curvatures, and/or the view position. However, an important perceptual observation shows that human perception is highly sensitive to edge-like features, i.e., points of high luminance variation. It is well-known in psychology that the human perceptual system interprets natural scenes with a wealth of visual cues including luminance, color opponency, and orientation which are proven to play a vital role in human perception and a sudden spatial change in any of these factors gives rise to features <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. This has led to great success in the research of edge detection in image processing. In 2D images, edges, characterizing the sudden change in the intensity, are one of the most important properties of objects since they correspond to the changes in geometric or photometric properties of modeled scenes.</p><p>Strongly inspired by the edge detection techniques for 2D images, this paper presents the Photic Extremum Lines (PELs), a new type of feature lines which characterizes the sudden change of illumination on 3D shapes. Since the illumination depends on the view position, light models, material, texture, and geometric properties, PELs are more general than the existing feature lines. More importantly, PEL provides the user more freedom to control the desired illustration by manipulating the above parameters. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, PEL illustrations are visually pleasing and convey the 3D surface and volume effectively. Although originated from image processing, PEL is different from image space edge detection in that PEL is computed in object space. The pixel-based representation of feature lines in image space will suffer from low precision due to the loss of 3D scene information during rendering, and is not suitable for further processing, such as stylization. In contrast, PEL does not have these constraints since PEL is defined in object space, thus, the user can totally control the illumination by manipulating the light which in turn helps the user to achieve the desired illustration.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are: 1. We propose the PEL on 3D surfaces, a new type of feature lines which characterizes the sudden change of the luminance. We give the mathematical definition of PEL and develop an efficient algorithm to compute PEL on polygonal meshes. 2. We show that PEL is view and light dependent and develop the techniques to determine the optimal setting of light which can help the user to achieve the most desirable illustration. 3. We compare PEL with the existing feature lines thoroughly and demonstrate that PEL is a flexible and powerful tool to illustrate 3D shapes for better visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>NPR techniques for scientific illustration. Inspired by the effectiveness in communication and the beauty of perceptual experience of traditional line drawings, researchers of scientific visualization are working towards improving the expressiveness of visualizations with computer generated line drawing techniques. Appel <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> proposed methods for silhouettes and sharp features extraction in object space and rendering in image space. Gooch et al. introduced an interactive technical illustration system in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Hertzmann and Zorin <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> proposed algorithm to extract silhouettes on smooth surfaces and generate line drawings automatically. To convey the structure and complexity of the interior of 3D shapes, Kalnins et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> proposed a method to draw creases in their WYSIWYG NPR drawing system, and Interrante et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> used ridge and valley lines to enhance transparent skin surfaces. DeCarlo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> introduced the suggestive contours, which extends the silhouettes and conveys the shape elegantly. Wilson and Ma <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> described a method of representing geometric complexity with line drawing in a pen-and-ink style. Ni et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> focused on multi-scale line drawings from 3D meshes and presented a method to view-dependently control the size of shape features depicted in computer-generated line drawings. Feature lines on surfaces. 3D shapes can be effectively illustrated with feature lines in both image space and object space. However, image space methods suffer from the low precision problem and the loss of 3D scene information during rendering. Saito and Takahashi <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> produced 3D images comprehensibly with 2D image processing operations. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, a classification of feature lines based on the surface derivative order and view dependency is given. It considers the surface normal as a first order differential quantity of surfaces. According to this classification, isophotes lines which connect points with constant brightness, are first order, view independent feature lines. They are widely used as the shading boundaries in toon shading <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Silhouettes are first order, view dependent feature lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. An excellent overview and classification of silhouettes generation algorithms for polygonal models are provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Suggestive contours <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> are second order, view dependent feature lines. Ridge-valley lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> are third order, view independent feature lines. In contrast to the aforementioned feature lines, the proposed PELs are third order, lighting and view dependent. Light dependency property provides the user more freedom to design the desirable illustration for better visualization.</p><p>Computing the differential properties of surfaces. The computation of differential properties of surfaces is very important to any feature line extraction algorithm. Volume illustration. Volumetric data are widely used in scientific and medical applications. Volume illustration can be viewed as nonphotorealistic rendering applied to volume visualization. The current approaches can be classified into two categories: the first approach enhances standard volume rendering algorithms with NPR techniques (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>), while the second approach applies illustrative drawing styles to volumes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Bruckner and Gröller <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> proposed VolumeShop, a dynamic volume illustration system which integrates many non-photorealistic rendering models to interactively alter and explore volume data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Definition</head><p>Edge detection is a well-studied problem in computer vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In 2D images, an edge point is defined as a point at which the gradient magnitude assumes a maximum in the gradient direction. The observation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> shows that for a grey-scale image of an illuminated 3D object under general illumination and reflection conditions, the zero-crossings of the second order directional derivative of the image intensity along the direction of the intensity gradient occur near the ridges and valleys of the 3D object. Inspired by the edge detection in image processing, we define Photic Extremum Lines which characterize the local variation of illumination directly on 3D surfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition:</head><p>The PEL is a set of points on the 3D surface where the variation of illumination in the direction of its gradient reaches the local maximum. Given a smooth surface patch S :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D ⊂ R 2 → R 3 , assume the illumi- nation function f : S → R is C 3 -continuous.</formula><p>The gradient of f is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∇ f = f u G − f v F EG − F 2 S u + f v E − f u F EG − F 2 S v<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where S u and S v are the tangent vectors, E, F, and G are the coefficients of the first fundamental form of S. Given arbitrary point p ∈ S, denote w the unit vector of the gradient of f , i.e., w =</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">∇f(p) ||∇f(p)|| .</formula><p>Then, the PEL is defined as the set of points satisfying:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">D w ||∇ f || = 0 and D w D w ||∇ f || &lt; 0 (2)</formula><p>The entire solutions of D w f = 0 form closed curves or curves that terminate at the surface boundaries. Thus, the surface can be divided into two regions, i.e., D w f &gt; 0 (colored in green in f &lt; 0, i.e., the variation of the illumination reaches its local maxima, which effectively convey useful information about the shape.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Lighting Dependency of PELs</head><p>Although originated from image processing, the key difference between PEL and edge detection is that the illumination on the 3D surface is totally user-controllable, i.e., the user can achieve the desired illustration by manipulating light freely. We will explain this in Sec. 3.3 in details. The illumination of 3D shapes depends on lighting conditions. Among various light models available in graphics, a commonly-used one is Phong specular-reflection model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">I = I amb + I di f f + I spec = k a I a + k d I d (n • l) + k s I s (v • r) n s , (3)</formula><p>where n, l, v, r are the surface normal, light vector, view vector, and reflection vector, respectively. Since Eq. 3 is a function of the light and view vectors, the corresponding PELs are view and light dependent.</p><p>PELs convey shapes by emphasizing significant variations of illumination over 3D surfaces. Aiming at 3D shapes illustration with concerns of human perceptual experiences, the light model should emphasize illumination variations strongly related to shape variations, but suppress those less related or orthogonal to shape variations. In Phong shading model, the ambient light is constant which does not contribute to the variation of illumination. The diffuse light is determined by both shape and light. The variation of the diffuse light is highly affected by the variation of the surface normal. The specular light is dominated by the viewing and lighting conditions, which can be considered an orthogonal factor of the 3D surface. Thus, it may introduce feature lines which are less related to the 3D shape and distracting for 3D shape illustration. At the same time, the power factor of the specular light is more computational expensive. So we ignore the ambient light and the specular light, and consider the diffuse light only,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">I = k d I d n • l.<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Note that the view vector is not involved in Eq. 4, thus, the corresponding PELs are independent of view position. However, the view dependent property is highly desirable in the real-world applications. More importantly, for real-world 3D shapes with complicated geometry and many details, the criteria to locate the feature lines are usually different in different parts and rather subjective. Thus, it is also highly desirable to provide users more freedom to control the desired illustration. To satisfy the view dependence as well as the user controllability and performance requirements, we propose the following light model for PEL:</p><p>• Main light: we set the main light source using a directional light whose light rays are parallel to the view vector. This setting is The main light #1 is a directional light whose direction coincides with the camera direction. By using the main light #1 alone, PELs convey the rough shape very well. However, some important lines on the eyes and feet are missing in (b). Then we use auxiliary spot lights #2 and #3 to increase the local contrast on eyes and feet to add more details (shown in (c)). Note that the Bunny body contains many short feature lines due to the small reliefs. These lines, however, are less favorable by the user. To remove these lines, we add another auxiliary spot light #4 to decrease the local contrast on the body. As a result shown in (d), most of the small feature lines are removed successfully.</p><p>based on our perceptual experience that setting the light direction coinciding with the view direction would result in the best lighting and visual effects. Therefore, the light moves when the view point changes. As a result, the illumination and the corresponding PELs are view dependent. • Auxiliary lights: we use optional spot lights to highlight the userspecified areas. The contribution of auxiliary lights to the illumination is local and independent of the view position.</p><p>The auxiliary spot lights are also defined with n • l, but applied locally to user interested regions, which provide the user freedom to control PEL in different areas. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> illustrates the proposed light model for PEL. Four lights ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3(a)</ref>) are used to illustrate the Stanford Bunny. Light #1 is the main light, whose direction coincides with the view direction. The purpose of the main light is to convey the rough geometry <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3(b)</ref>). However, some important lines, such as eyes and feet, are missing. Also, due to some small features, there exists many small PELs which cause distractions and are not helpful to convey the shape. Then, auxiliary lights are used to increase or decrease the local contrast of the specified regions, thus, PELs can be added or removed accordingly. For example, two auxiliary lights #2 and #3 are used to increase the contrast on the eye and foot <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3(c)</ref>). Another auxiliary light #4 is used to decrease the contrast on the body. As a result, we achieve better PELs shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3(d)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Optimal Lighting for PEL</head><p>For simple shapes, one can usually achieve the desired illustration using the main light alone. However, most of the real-world models have complicated geometry and many details, which can not be illustrated using a single light. Thus, we need to use auxiliary lights to improve the illustration. As mentioned above, the key advantage of PEL is that users can fully control the auxiliary lights, such as the number of lights, their positions, and directions. It is usually a tedious work to manipulate these parameters manually. To minimize the effort of user interaction, we develop a technique to compute the optimal setting of the auxiliary lights automatically.</p><p>We assume that the user specifies several regions of interest to be improved. Each region is small enough that we can use just one auxiliary light. Now, the problem can be stated as follows:</p><p>Given a user-specified patchS ⊂ S, c = S SdA S dA . We want to find a spot light l aux at position x with light direction d = x−c</p><p>x−c such that the contrast of illumination onS is either maximized if one wants to add details or minimized if one wants to remove lines, i.e., max S ||∇ f || 2 dA, to add details,</p><p>or min</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">S ||∇ f || 2 dA, to remove details,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">f = I aux , I aux (u, v) = k aux I aux k c + k l d + k q d 2 n(u, v) • l, l = x − S(u, v) x − S(u, v) , d = S(u, v) − x</formula><p>Note that the cut-off angle of the spot light gives rise to the discontinuity of the illumination which in turns would result in unnecessary feature lines. To avoid this, we require that the cut-off angle of the spot light is large enough to coverS. For each point inside the spot light region (which is larger thanS), two illumination functions f = I main and f = I aux are defined. To compute derivatives of illumination, f = I aux is used for any point p ∈S, while f = I main is used for any point p ∈ S \S. Therefore, though the overlap of the two functions results in discontinuities, we can guarantee local continuity everywhere by switching between the two functions. Since PELs are defined with local extremum and the illumination is locally continuous for all the points, the auxiliary light will improve the PEL illustration ofS without introducing unnecessary lines on the boundary.</p><p>We would point out that we set the illumination function to be f = I aux for the optimization of the auxiliary light and the extraction of PEL inS. The optimal auxiliary lights are located in object space. Thus, the optimal setting of the auxiliary lights are not affected by the change of the main light and various viewing conditions. Though the optimization process is not real time, once computed, the auxiliary lights are fixed in the object space. Therefore, additional computational overheads are avoided. More importantly, the auxiliary lights improve the PEL illustration without causing any incoherence in animation with changing viewing conditions, as demonstrated in the accompanying video sequences. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref> illustrates the optimal lighting for the Bunny model. Note that the discontinuity of the illumination occurs in the shaded images ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4 (b)</ref> and (c)). With the guarantee of local continuity for PEL extraction as mentioned above, user-desirable improved PEL illustration of the bunny eye is achieved without introducing meaningless feature lines on the boundaries ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4 (e)</ref> and (f)). It also demonstrates that PEL can NOT be extracted from image space. Using any edge detection algorithms, the aforementioned discontinuity of illuminance will definitely result in an edge, which is not acceptable. This also explains one important difference between PEL and the edge detection in image processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">PEL EXTRACTION ALGORITHM</head><p>This section presents the algorithm to extract PEL from 3D models. Since polygonal meshes are widely used in graphics, we develop our PEL extraction algorithm on surfaces approximated by triangle meshes. To improve this, we add a spot light which covers the eye and maximizes the contrast (see (b)). As a result, the features are enhanced and the corresponding PELs illustrate the eye very well (see (e)). (c) and (f) show the effect of using a spot light which minimizes the local contrast on the eye. As expected, the feature lines are removed accordingly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Algorithmic Overview</head><p>Given a triangle mesh S and the illumination f on each vertex, the extraction of PEL on S is as follows: 5. Trace the zero-crossings to get the PEL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Preprocessing</head><p>The purpose of preprocessing is to reduce the noise of illumination. In our proposed light model, both the main diffuse light and the auxiliary spot lights are functions of n • l. Thus, the noise of illumination is mainly caused by the noise of geometry, i.e., the surface normal. We apply the bilateral filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> to process the vector field n on S. For each vertex v, denote its neighborhood by N(v). The bilateral filter is defined as:n s , which penalizes large variation of the feature field. In practice, we find this step is usually helpful to improve the robustness of our algorithm for the scanned models. We follow Fleishman et al.'s method <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> to set the parameters σ c and σ s : the user selects a point on the mesh where the surface is expected to be smooth, and then a radius r of the neighborhood of the point is defined. Set σ c = r/2 and σ s to be the standard deviation of ρ(v, p) in the selected neighborhood.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(v) = ∑ p∈N(v) W c ( p − v )W s (ρ(v, p))n(p) ∑ p∈N(v) W c ( p − v )W s (ρ(v, p)) with ρ(v, p) = arccos( n(v) • n(p) ) p − v ,</formula><p>The advantage of smoothing surface normal is that it needs to be computed only once, which avoids computational overheads and guarantees achieving PEL illustration in real time for meshes of reasonable size. Another option is to smooth the illumination f on the surface, which has to be performed in each frame once the lighting or viewing condition is changed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Computing the Derivatives</head><p>The definition of PEL involves third order derivatives of the surface illumination, thus the key is to compute the derivatives efficiently and robustly. Similar to Rusinkiewicz's method to estimate curvatures and their derivatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, we compute the per-vertex derivatives by averaging adjacent per-face derivatives. Given an arbitrary scalar function g defined on the mesh M, i.e., g : M → R, we consider a triangle T ∈ M with vertices v i ∈ R 3 and the associated scalar value g i = g(v i ) ∈ R, i = 1, 2, 3. The per-face coordinate system is defined in the plane perpendicular to the face normal. Three vertices of T in the per-face coordinate system are denoted by</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">(x i , y i ) ∈ R 2 , i = 1, 2, 3.</formula><p>The per-face gradient ∇g is computed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">∇g = ∂g ∂x ∂g ∂y = 1 d T y 2 − y 3 y 3 − y 1 y 1 − y 2 x 3 − x 2 x 1 − x 3 x 2 − x 1 ⎛ ⎝ g 1 g 2 g 3 ⎞ ⎠</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">d T = (x 1 y 2 − y 1 x 2 ) + (x 2 y 3 − y 2 x 3 ) + (x 3 y 1 − y 3 x 1 )</formula><p>is twice the signed area of T . The gradient of each vertex is considered the weighted average of the gradient of its adjacent faces. The vertex coordinate system (u, v) is defined in the plane perpendicular to the vertex normal. Note that the vertex and face coordinate systems are usually different. Thus coordinate system transformation must be applied before computing the contribution of the per-face derivatives to the per-vertex derivatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. We first rotate the local vertex coordinate system to be coplanar with the local face coordinate system (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 5</ref>). Then, given a point (u i , v i ) = u i u i + v i v i in the vertex coordinate system, we compute the per-vertex gradient in the local face coordinate system with</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">∇g(u i , v i ) = u i • ∇g(x, y) v i • ∇g(x, y) .</formula><p>After the per-vertex gradients for all the adjacent faces of the vertex are computed, they will be accumulated with weighted averaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Following the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, we use the Voronoi area weight w i , which is set to be the portion of the area which lies closest to the vertex. Finally, the per-vertex derivative is computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">∇g(u, v) = ∑ i w i ∇g(u i , v i ).</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Tracing PEL</head><p>Once we compute the directional derivatives of variation of illumination at each mesh vertex v, we are ready to check whether the mesh edge</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">[v 1 , v 2 ] contains the zero-crossing.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">COMPARISONS OF PEL WITH OTHER FEATURE LINES</head><p>This section compares PEL with several commonly-used feature lines, contours, suggestive contours, and ridge-valley lines. These feature lines are solely determined by local geometry properties (e.g., normals and curvatures) as well as the view position. PEL, however, depends on view position and illumination (which in turns depends on local geometric properties). <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> summarizes the properties of contours, suggestive contours, ridges &amp; valleys, and PEL. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, a classification of feature lines based on differential properties is proposed, which considers surface normal as a first order differential quantity of surfaces. In this way, suggestive contours are defined with radial curvature which is a second order derivative. Ridge-valley lines are third order derivatives of surfaces. Similarly, in our proposed light model, PELs are defined as second order derivative of n • l, which turns out to be third order derivative of surfaces as well. PEL versus Contours. Contours, one of the widely used feature lines, are lines where a surface turns away from the viewer and becomes invisible. Contours are defined as the set of points with n • v = 0. Although contours show strongest cues with model-to-background distinction, contours alone are quite limited, since they can not capture the structure and complexity of the shape interior. An example is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 8</ref>, the contours (colored in blue) fail to show the interior geometry. PEL versus Suggestive Contours. Suggestive contours are considered as the extension of the actual contours of surfaces. Given an arbitrary point p on a smooth surface S, the view vector v is projected onto the tangent plane of p to obtain w. The normal curvature in the direction of w is called as radial curvature k r . Then the suggestive contour generator is the set of points satisfying <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">k r = 0, where D w k r &gt; 0.</formula><p>Suggestive contours extend the actual contours of surfaces in concave regions and convey the shape in a succinct and elegant way. However, they can not illustrate salient features in convex regions. Examples are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 6</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 8</ref>. To compensate for this, DeCarlo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> suggested to set different value of k r , i.e., given a user-specified value c, compute the points satisfying k r = c. By carefully choosing a positive value c, we can get suggestive contours in certain convex regions, while losing useful suggestive contours in other regions including concave regions as a tradeoff. So for a real-world complicated shape with many convex and concave regions, it is almost impossible to find a globally consistent value c for all regions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 7</ref> illustrates this phenomenon by showing the suggestive contours with three different value c &lt; 0 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 7(b)</ref>), c = 0 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Fig. 7(c)</ref>), and c &gt; 0 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 7(d)</ref>). In contrast, the proposed PEL method works well on both convex and concave regions (( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 7(e)</ref>)). Simultaneously, suggestive contours may also extend contour lines onto smooth surfaces which cause visual distraction, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 8</ref>.  PEL versus Ridges/Valleys. Ridge/valley lines (a.k.a. curves on a surface along which the surface bends sharply) are powerful shape descriptors. For a smooth surface S, we denote by k max and k min the maximum and minimum principal curvatures, and t max and t min the corresponding principal directions. By denoting the derivatives of the principal curvatures along their corresponding curvatures directions e max = ∂k max /∂t max and e min = ∂k min /∂t min , ridges and valleys are the extrema of the principal curvatures along their curvature directions: Ridge/valley lines convey shapes where surface bends sharply. However, visually salient features may also occur in smooth regions such as the vertical contours of the cylindrical part of the CSG model of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 8</ref> where ridge-valley lines fail. Comparing with ridge/valley lines, PEL alone can convey features in smooth regions. Another widely recognized limitation of ridge/valley lines is that they are view-independent curves. Thus, they are locked on the object without being able to slide on it when the viewing conditions change, which does not make a natural looking line drawing in animation sequences. Examples are shown in the accompanying video sequences to highlight this effect. It is also demonstrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 9</ref> that the illustration of ridge/valley lines appears more like surface marks rather than a natural line drawing. We also compare the feature lines with hand-drawn illustration done by artists in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 9</ref>. Clearly, PEL mimics the hand-drawn illustration better than all the other feature lines. We survey and discuss with 10 artists from a cartoon animation studio. We find out that our approach of defining PEL based on the significant variation of illumination is quite similar to the way of finding a line where an artist actually draws. As the result of our survey, 9 of the 10 artists agree that the PEL illustration appears better than the other feature lines shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 9</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">e max = 0</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>We conduct our experiments on a workstation with a 3.2GHz Xeon processor and 3GB of memory. With our un-optimized code, 0.170 to 1.684 seconds per frame can be achieved with test surfaces ranging from 44K to 320K triangles, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>.

And the optimal lighting is also computed once for each auxiliary light when it is introduced. We have also developed a user-friendly interface that allows the user to easily select the to-beimproved regions on 3D surfaces. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Fig. 10</ref> shows examples of PEL on surfaces.</p><p>Besides surfaces, we also apply PEL to volumes. For volumetric datasets, the user first extracts several isosurfaces which are of specific interest. Then our system draws PELs and/or contours on each surface. Usually, the extracted isosurfaces are not equally important. Therefore, we only draw the contours on the isosurfaces which are less important. The user can also use various NPR shadings (e.g., toon shading and Gooch shading) to highlight the important details. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 12</ref> shows examples of PEL from volumetric datasets. Two isosurfaces are extracted from each dataset. We illustrate the outer isosurface using contours and the inner isosurface using PEL. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Fig. 11</ref> demonstrates that one can achieve better illustration by combining PEL and contours than using contours alone.  . PEL together with contours illustrates the volumetric data much better than using contours alone.</p><p>In most of our test cases, PEL can convey the shapes similar to human perception. However, there exists several models (especially synthetic surfaces with very few or even no features) that PEL does not work well. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 13</ref> illustrates PEL on a torus. In general, torus can be nicely illustrated by contours. Without the aid of auxiliary lights, PEL is a closed, ellipse-like curve (colored in blue in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 13(b)</ref>) which locates very close to the silhouettes. Clearly, PEL is not helpful to convey the shape in this case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper, we have presented Photic Extremum Lines (PELs), a new type of feature lines for scientific illustration of 3D surfaces and volumes. In contrast to the existing feature lines which are solely defined by geometry and/or viewing positions, PEL characterizes the significant variations of illumination on 3D surfaces. PEL offers the user many degrees of freedom, such as light positions, the number of lights, and various light models, to achieve the desirable illustration. We also made comprehensive comparisons between PEL and the existing approaches. Through a wide array of experiments, we have shown that PEL enables a flexible and effective tool to illustrate 3D surfaces and volumes and reveal most important insights towards better visualization.</p><p>In our current system for volume illustration, PEL is computed on the extracted iso-surfaces of the underlying volume. Thus, it is difficult to achieve real-time interaction. Recently, Burns et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> proposed a method to reduce the dimensionality by directly extracting feature lines that lie on iso-surfaces within a volume. One of our ongoing <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 12</ref>. PEL for volumetric datasets. Two isosurfaces are extracted from the volumetric datasets. To emphasize the inner structure, the outer isosurface is illustrated with contours only (colored in blue).</p><p>(a) Shaded model (b) PEL and contours <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 13</ref>. PEL on torus has distracting lines (shown in blue) which are not helpful to convey the shape.</p><p>work is to compute PEL from volumetric datasets directly without the need of iso-surface extraction. We will also work on the hardware implementation to further speedup the PEL computation for surfaces and volumes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Published 14</head><label>14</label><figDesc>September 2007.</figDesc></figure>
