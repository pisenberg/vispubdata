			<abstract>
				<p>Physics-based flow visualization techniques seek to mimic laboratory flow visualization methods with virtual analogues. In this work we describe the rendering of a virtual rheoscopic fluid to produce images with results strikingly similar to laboratory experiments with real-world rheoscopic fluids using products such as Kalliroscope. These fluid additives consist of microscopic, anisotropic particles which, when suspended in the flow, align with both the flow velocity and the local shear to produce high-quality depictions of complex flow structures. Our virtual rheoscopic fluid is produced by defining a closed-form formula for the orientation of shear layers in the flow and using this orientation to volume render the flow as a material with anisotropic reflectance and transparency. Examples are presented for natural convection, thermocapillary convection, and Taylor-Couette flow simulations. The latter agree well with photographs of experimental results of Taylor-Couette flows from the literature.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>For flow visualization in two dimensions, many computational techniques exist for the generation of high-quality stream-, streak-, or pathlines which often give a complete picture of the state of the flow. Additionally, more modern techniques employing dense, texture-based methods have significantly improved what flow visualization tools are available to researchers for visualization of 2D velocity fields and 3D velocity fields constrained to surfaces (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> for a review of the literature). However, the state of the art in 3D, time-dependent flow visualization is still evolving.</p><p>In this work, we present a new computational visualization technique that creates a Virtual Rheoscopic Fluid (VRF) mimicking the behavior of popular commercial flow visualization products like Kalliroscope <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. This product is a liquid additive which consists of suspended microscopic reflective flakes that orient themselves with the flow so that they are strongly reflective in some areas and nearly transparent in others. Our technique compares very favorably with traditional computational visualization techniques, as demonstrated by <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>. In this work, we propose a new model of rheoscopic fluids which describes in closed form the state of idealized flakes suspended in the flow. Then, we demonstrate how volume rendering can be used to render images of the flow from this model. Our results employ data generated by a finite element simulation for three different flow problems. Finally, we compare our results to available photographs from the literature of similar experimental studies conducted using Kalliroscope.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RHEOSCOPIC FLUIDS</head><p>The term "rheoscope" was originally coined to describe a device which could detect the flow of an electric current <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and is derived from the Greek "rheo" meaning "flow" and "skopein" meaning "to look at." Therefore, a rheoscopic fluid is one that allows the viewer to see the features of the flow directly. The most well-known material for making rheoscopic fluids in the laboratory is a commercial product, Kalliroscope AQ1000. It consists of ∼ 25 × 6 × 0.07μm flakes which, when suspended in liquids, "align with the shear layers" in the flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. In ambient lighting conditions, those flakes that are oriented normal to the observer reflect the most light back to the observer, and those oriented parallel to his line of sight reflect little or no light. This property leads to the appearance of light and dark areas in the flow which highlight flow structures with striking clarity. Depending on the concentration of the suspension, the fluid can be made to appear anywhere from nearly clear to mostly opaque, and thereby the depth of the visualization can be controlled to some extent. Additionally, careful illumination of the flow, such as with laser sheets <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> or slit-illumination from incandescent sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, can be used to isolate particular cross sections of a flow for further study, and the use of multiple, differentlycolored lights directed at the flow from different directions can be used to highlight orientation information about the flow.</p><p>When it comes to the simulation of a rheoscopic fluid for use in the visualization of simulated fluid flow, there are a number of possible approaches. Based on Jeffery's work on the differential equations describing the motion of triaxial ellipsoidal particles immersed in a fluid <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Savaş developed a stochastic treatment of the equations and plotted orientation probability distributions for some simple flows <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Later, Gauthier et al. directly simulated Jeffery's transport equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> for a collection of virtual particles. However, they limited their study to a 2D, axisymmetric simulation (rather than a fully three-dimensional problem) and rendered the fluid for comparison to experiments employing laser sheet illumination. Also, as Savaş and Gauthier et al. both note, the simulated particles are prone to tumbling and chaotic motions which lessen the usefulness of their techniques for general visualization purposes. In this work, we examine two different but related approaches.</p><p>Given the possibly chaotic orientations determined by dynamical simulation of flakes seeded in a velocity field, we prefer to approach the problem through the oft-repeated description that the suspended flakes "align with the shear layers." There is no consistent definition for what constitutes a "shear layer" in a general, three-dimensional fluid flow outside of what can be determined for simple shear flows like the plane Couette flow case described below. Consequently, the goal and main contribution of this work is the development a mathematical description of the orientation of the local shear for general flow problems which is consistent with the orientation expected in simple flow regimes. We then use this orientation to render idealized flakes within the domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Computation of Shear Layer Orientation</head><p>To derive a surface normal for our computational flakes, we assume that our idealized particles are neutrally buoyant so that they may be passively convected along with the flow and that they first point their long axis parallel to the velocity vector. This is consistent with what is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> for long, thin particles. Given this, it is then necessary to define an orientation for the flake's normal vector. To that end, consider the force on an infinitesimal plane embedded in the flow with  its normal aligned with the velocity (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Rû = σû = −pû + 2μDuû = −pû + μ " ∇u + (∇u) T "û (1)</formula><p>where u is the fluid velocity,û is the unit vector pointing in the velocity direction, σ is the fluid stress tensor, Du is the strain-rate tensor, p is the pressure, and μ is the fluid viscosity. Subtracting the component of Rû in the velocity direction from Equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Rû − [(Rû ) •û]û = −pû + μ " ∇u + (∇u) T "û − n −p (û •û)û + h" μ " ∇u + (∇u) T "û"ûiûo = μ " ∇u + (∇u) T "û − nû T h μ " ∇u + (∇u) T "iûoû = 2μDuû − 2μ "û T Duû "û<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Since all of the normal stresses (both viscous and pressure) have canceled out, and μ is immaterial to the direction of this vector, we drop it in favor of a purely kinematic representation in terms of the strainrate tensor and the velocity direction. We propose that Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>represents the normal, n, to the shear layers present in the flow:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">n = 2Duû − 2 "û T Duû "û<label>(3)</label></formula><p>A schematic diagram of the derivation of n is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>Note that this direction is everywhere perpendicular to the velocity (by definition) and therefore is parallel to the normal of a family of local streamsurfaces embedded in the flow. This is in keeping with the other oft-repeated statement about the motion of microscopic platelets seeded throughout a fluid-that they align with streamsurfaces. A physical interpretation of n is that it is the velocity of separation between two infinitesimally separated points on the same streamline due to shearing. In order to gain some intuition about the behavior of the orientation given in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>, we consider a few simple flow regimes.</p><p>Plane Couette Flow: Steady incompressible plane Couette flow is the flow between infinite parallel plates where one plate is held fixed and the other moves horizontally with constant velocity, α. With plates at y = 0 and y = 1, the flow between the plates has the velocity field: Computing n as in Equation (3), gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">u =ˆαy 0 0˜(4)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">n =ˆ0 α 0˜(5)</formula><p>This orientation is as we would expect for a pure shear flow. Also, this flow is locally the same as that found in the linear sublayer of viscous boundary layers which indicates that the proposed shear layer orientation will be orthogonal to no-slip surfaces as we would expect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cylindrical Poiseuille Flow:</head><p>The steady, pressure-driven flow of an incompressible fluid with viscosity μ and a constant driving pressure drop ΔP/Δz in a cylindrical tube of radius 1 has velocity given by (see, e.g, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">u = − 1 4μ ΔP Δzˆ0 0 1 − (x 2 + y 2 )˜(6)</formula><p>Computing the shear layer orientation vector as before gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">n = − 2 4μ ΔP Δz 0 @ 2 4 0 0 −x 0 0 −y −x −y 0 3 5 2 4 0 0 1 3 5 − 2 4 0 0 1 3 5ˆ0 0 1˜2 4 0 0 −x 0 0 −y −x −y 0 3 5 2 4 0 0 1 3 5 1 A = − 1 2μ ΔP Δz 2 4 −x −y 0 3 5<label>(7)</label></formula><p>This agrees with the direction of the local shear in this flow and is also orthogonal to the cylinder's surface as we also would expect.</p><p>In addition to these simple flow cases, there are also three distinct cases where Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>is degenerate and n = 0. First, the n is zero everywhere the velocity is zero. In the interior, these points correspond to critical points in the flow field, and no unique shear layer orientation is definable at these points. Second, rigid-body motion of the fluid (the case where Du = 0) will give a zero vector for the shear layer orientation. In this case the fluid is locally moving with only translation or rigid-body rotation and no shearing within the local region. Finally, when the velocity is an eigenvector of strain-rate tensor (i.e., Duû = λû), then, since we have eliminated the component in the velocity direction, the shear layer orientation as computed by Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>is zero. This happens when the flow is purely extensional in the velocity direction. The next section describes how Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>is used for flow visualization and how these three cases where n = 0 are handled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">IMPLEMENTATION</head><p>Now that we have derived a closed-form equation defining the orientation of the shear layers in the fluid, we now describe two methods we have used with Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>to render images of the flow.</p><p>To summarize our preferred approach, we volume render the dataset using our shear layer orientation vector field as "surface" normals for shading and illumination purposes. Voxels are lit according to this normal field, and the transparency transfer function uses it as well. Our method is most similar to that of Schussman and Ma in which voxels with anisotropic properties are represented by spherical harmonics which have been constructed by subvoxel-scale renderings of a large number of streamtubes lit using a standard shading model and averaged over the voxel <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Our method differs in two important ways: First, for a given view direction, Schussman and Ma generate an intermediate set of standard voxels from their anisotropic representation which are subsequently rendered with standard volume rendering algorithms. We, as noted below, take account of the anisotropic material reflectance and light directions directly in the volume renderer. Second, by basing their method on fine streamtubes, Schussman and Ma's method generates the appearance of a very large number of streamlines in the domain with high-quality lighting. The method presented here, as noted in the previous section, generates normals to a family of particular streamsurfaces which are related to the local shear in the flow and are extended through the domain. Therefore, our method gives images that are similar to what could be achieved by rendering partially-transparent isosurfaces of the underlying streamfunction were it available.</p><p>Before we describe this volume-rendering approach, however, we begin with a description of our initial solution to the problem in order to motivate the design of our current method. It is instructive to examine its limitations as a guidance for future development and understanding our current solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Particle Rendering</head><p>Our first approach to this problem was to directly render small but macroscopic flakes in the domain. In this approach, the domain was filled with partially transparent quadrilaterals which were fixed at predefined locations and had their long axes parallel to the velocity and their normals given by Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. The size of the quadrilaterals was based on their density in the domain (higher density required smaller particles) up to the limits imposed by computational and graphics hardware resources. For a domain with a sufficient density of particles, the effect should have closely approximated laboratory results. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> shows a rendering using this technique for one of our test data sets (Taylor-Couette flow, described in Section 4.2). However, several rather severe artifacts can be observed.</p><p>With this method, when the particles are large enough that they overlap, the appearance is jumbled and the artifacts are difficult to ignore. To lessen these artifacts, the particles' transparency was texture mapped such that their edges faded out completely. A rendering using this method is what is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, but the results are still not satisfactory. Additionally, the gaps between particles are now a problem. This is particularly true if the dataset is regular in any way, as is the case in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>. Aliasing and moire effects become very distracting, particularly during animation. A small amount of jittering helps break up the regularity, but at the cost of fidelity to the data. In practice, any amount of jittering sufficient to break up the aliasing and moire fringing is enough to jumble the coherence of small scale flow structures and reintroduces the artifacts resulting from too many overlapping particles.</p><p>The observation we make at this point is that in a real fluid, the particles are small and numerous enough to give the impression of a continuous volume with reflective properties derived from the field in Equation (3). In a real fluid, the individual particles themselves are not generally visible; they merely impart their reflective properties to the fluid. An alternative solution then is to volume render the fluid, using these orientations as proxy surface normals to illuminate and shade the voxels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Volume Rendering</head><p>Three-dimensional datasets are typically volume rendered by assigning color and transparency values to a set of samples in the domain via some transfer function. These values are then projected to the screen in some manner (ray marching, Z-buffering, etc.). As an alternative to mapping color to the data, geometric properties such as reflectivity, surface normal, and anisotropy could be mapped instead. The process would then involve a shading step where the color is computed from the light sources in the scene and the geometric information accompanying the samples. This is the approach we have taken here.</p><p>Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>provides every point in the domain with a vector n. When the volume rendering algorithm shades a voxel, the illumination model interprets this vector as the "surface" normal and shades accordingly. Our implementation applies the standard diffuse and specular components of the OpenGL fixed function illumination equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>The transparency of a voxel is given by (n •v) 2 wherev is the unit vector in the direction of the viewer. This reflects the fact that the flakes are nearly invisible when viewed "edge-on" (i.e. when their surface normals are 90 • from the viewer). We square the term to avoid negative values, enhance the contrast, and better define the transitions.</p><p>Further experimentation with this transfer function is warranted, and the best form for it may depend on the dataset and choice of light sources. Whenever the orientation vector is zero, the vertex is treated as 100% transparent.</p><p>In our OpenGL implementation, we volume render our datasets by rendering a stack of object-aligned slices through the volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> in a process that produces images of equivalent quality to the CPU-based shear-warp factorization approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. These slices are generated directly from the computational mesh in the dataset using the vertices of the given finite elements to define quadrilaterals, and so no interpolation of the data is performed. As such we do not currently use 2D or 3D hardware texturing. We instead handle the data as pervertex attributes. In the case of the cylindrical Taylor-Couette dataset, our slices are built from the nested cylindrical surfaces of the hexahedral computational grid. In the natural convection and thermocapillary problems, the finite element mesh is axis-aligned, and, therefore, so are our slices. Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>is pre-computed by the CFD simulation code (see Section 4), and the transparency and lighting are computed in a vertex shader. This method of volume rendering is rather rudimentary since it is so closely tied to the input datasets, and because the image quality is highly dependent on the view direction. This leads to some inflexibility and restricts the camera to view directions mostly orthogonal to the slices. Improving this portion of our implementation is a priority and will allow for improved interactivity and improved image quality.</p><p>We would like to emphasize that the VRF technique is not limited to the particular volume rendering implementation just described. The above method was employed because it produces high-quality images, is simple to implement, and thereby greatly facilitates validation and refinement of the method. The VRF technique can be applied in any volume rendering algorithm once the shear layer orientation has been computed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RESULTS</head><p>In the following subsections, we present results for three problems: Taylor-Couette flow, natural convection in a differentially heated cubical enclosure, and thermocapillary convection in a thin layer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">CFD Simulation</head><p>The data used to drive the OpenGL application described above is derived from MGF-a 3D, parallel, finite element simulation code developed for the study of fluid flow and heat transfer problems and now extended to many other classes of partial differential equation systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Both the calculation of the fluid velocity, pressure, and temperature (in the natural convection and thermocapillary cases), as well as the shear layer orientation described by Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>above, are computed by MGF and supplied to the rendering application through data files. In MGF, the velocity is approximated by piecewise-continuous, triquadratic Lagrange finite elements on an unstructured hexahedral mesh. The orientation vectors are computed in a two-step process. First the strain-rate tensor is computed by L 2projection of the velocity gradient and its transpose onto piecewisecontinuous, trilinear Lagrange finite elements which are coincident with the velocity elements. Then, the values of the strain-rate tensor and velocity at each vertex are used to compute the values of the shear layer orientation vector in the triquadratic basis. Wherever the velocity is identically zero, the orientation vector is also set to zero in the output.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Taylor Couette Flow</head><p>Flow between concentric rotating cylinders is a classic problem in fluid mechanics (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> for review of the early literature). Much experimental work has been devoted to discovering and classifying the flow states and the instabilities that drive them (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> where Kalliroscope was used to visualize flow features and, thereby, classify the flow regimes). <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows a schematic drawing of a typical Taylor-Couette flow. Above certain critical parameter values, the purely azimuthal flow becomes unstable and a stack of toroidal Taylor vortices forms in the flow. As the controlling parameters are increased, other patterns form in flow like modulated wavy Taylor vortices as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.</p><p>It was the simulation of this problem, in fact, that lead to the development of the VRF technique described in this work. Faced with a number of difficulties visualizing the patterns formed in the flow simulations, and given the excellent experimental visualizations available in the literature, a computational analogue to the experimentalists' rheoscopic fluids was deliberately sought out. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 1(a)</ref>, 1(b), and 1(c) show typical vorticity isosurfaces, volume rendering of vorticity, and streamlines colored by velocity magnitude as generated using ParaView <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>The concentration of vorticity both in the Taylor vortices and also in the boundary layers makes it extremely difficult to use isosurfaces of vorticity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1(a)</ref>) to identify the structures in the flow, since vortex-related isosurfaces may be masked by intervening surfaces from the boundary layers. Generic volume rendering algorithms available in off-the-shelf rendering packages like ParaView are expensive for non-Cartesian meshes and result in unacceptable performance for reasonably large data sets even when they do generate acceptable results <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1(b)</ref>). Finally, streamlines <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1(c)</ref>) tend to become cluttered in data with complex flow features such as these. This is a particular issue in the Taylor-Couette problem as the flow around the Taylor vortices is weak in comparison to the bulk flow in the azimuthal direction. Additionally, time series animation of streamlines is plagued with additional clutter due to the fact that they are of finite length and regenerated independently for each frame.</p><p>Depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 1(d)</ref>, 5(a), 6 and 8 are screen shots from Taylor-Couette flow cases rendered using the VRF technique. A Taylor vortex flow case is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>(a), while wavy Taylor vortex flow is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>(b). The images in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> were rendered using a red point light source located above, to left, and in front of the cylinder and a green point light located above, to the right, and behind it. The other images were rendered using similar lighting configurations, with two colors designed to help distinguish the vortices. The datasets generated for these visualizations were simulated by MGF on a 120 × 60 × 8-element mesh with ∼1.5M degrees of freedom.</p><p>Comparison of the two images in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows good agreement between our technique and what is possible in physical experiments (photo adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). Further comparison between <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figures 6 and 7</ref> (as adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>) shows that the use of multiple colored lights distributed around the subject produces results consistent with what is found in the experimental literature.</p><p>Interpretation of the images proceeds as follows: Light areas correspond to places where the local shear flow is orthogonal to the viewing direction. Dark areas correspond to local shear flows that are parallel to the viewing direction. This means that dark areas tend to be between neighboring vortices, and that light areas represent the vortices themselves. In the multi-colored light source examples, areas where the color is the same as a single light source are those where the local shear flow is orthogonal to the vector between the point and the light and parallel to the other light. Areas where there is a blend of colors represent regions where the flow is oriented between the light directions. This allows one to distinguish vortices by the alternation in color. In these cases, the near-wall flow has an upward component in every other vortex leading to a mostly red color and a downward component in their neighbors leading to a mostly green color.</p><p>The real advantage of the technique described in this work is best seen in animations of images from timesteps in evolving flow prob- lems. These Taylor-Couette flow simulation cases are initialized with purely azimuthal cylindrical Couette flow but, due to parameter values above the critical instability condition, immediately begin to develop Taylor vortices and then, in the latter case, wavy Taylor vortices. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows a sequence of five timesteps in the evolution of the wavy Taylor vortex flow case. In the first frame, Taylor vortices can clearly be seen developing from the top and bottom ends of the cylinder and growing into the smooth, azimuthal flow regime that still exists in the central part of the domain. In subsequent frames, the transition from plain Taylor vortices to wavy Taylor vortices is readily apparent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Natural Convection</head><p>The flow of a differentially-heated incompressible buoyant fluid in square and cubical enclosures has long been a computational benchmarking problem for Navier-Stokes and heat transfer codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Recent experimental results for the three-dimensional problem have given CFD researchers high-quality experimental data that allows for the use of this problem for code validation as well as inter-code benchmarking <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. In the case used here, an air-filled cubical cavity is heated from below and cooled from above. The intervening sidewalls are held at the fixed, linear, conduction profile between the two temperature extremes. Above a critical value of the temperature difference, such a fluid is unstable since a much lighter fluid sits below a denser one. This instability drives convection in the problem. This simulation was conducted on a 32 3 -element mesh consisting of ∼1.1M degrees of freedom. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> illustrates, from many different viewing angles, application of the VRF technique to one timestep in the simulation of this problem. In <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>(a), instead of coloring the vertices using the colors of the light sources, value at the vertices is determined using Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>and the vector to the light source as before, but hue is mapped to the temperature data (with red mapped to hot and blue to cold). Therefore, we have the advantage of a traditional volume rendering of the temperature field coupled to the flow structure depiction made possible by the VRF technique developed here. This allows us to see through the fluid in certain areas and discover what is happening inside the flow. In <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>(b), two point light sources, one blue and one yellow, are used to render the same views of the flow domain.</p><p>Apparent in these images are a number of coherent structures within the flow. The upper left image in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>(a), on its right-hand faces, clearly shows a descending plume of cold (blue) fluid. The presence of a rising plume of warmer (green) fluid is also shown in this image between the two vertical faces, as is the descending recirculated fluid that has reached the cold upper surface and turned down the right-hand wall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Thermocapillary Convection</head><p>Like the natural convection problem in the previous section, surfacetension driven convection in an enclosure, where fluid is heated from below and has it's upper surface free, is a classic problem in fluid mechanics and nonlinear dynamics (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>). This simulation was conducted on a 48 × 48 × 18-element mesh consisting of ∼1.4M degrees of freedom. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref> illustrates the result of the VRF technique applied to the steady state condition reached at the end of a simulation of this problem. As with the natural convection dataset, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref>(a) is rendered with hue mapped to temperature with red being hot and blue being cold and with value determined by our VRF technique. Similarly, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref>(b) is rendered with one yellow and one blue light point light source.</p><p>In this problem, temperature differences on the upper surface lead to surface tension differences there which drive the formation of a pattern of cells when viewed from above. These cells consist of toroidal vortices with flow rising up through the center of the cell, out along the upper surface, down between adjacent cells, and back in along the lower boundary. The VRF technique clearly illustrates the structure of these cells. The boundaries between the four cells is clearly delineated by the vertical surfaces that form a cross through the center of the domain (note that this is most strongly apparent in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10(a)</ref>). The cores of the toroidal vortices are also readily apparent as shown by the four distinct, rounded-square rings in each of the four quadrants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Performance</head><p>The performance of our technique can range tremendously depending on the size of the dataset, the graphics hardware being used, and the underlying implementation of volume rendering employed. For our simple approach to volume rendering (using a fixed number of non-interpolated, object-aligned slices composited by Z-buffer hardware), we achieved real-time frame rates on both our datasets using an NVidia GeForce 8800 graphics card (&gt; 20fps) and sub-real-time but usable frame rates on older hardware (∼ 4fps on a ATI Mobility Radeon 9600). This does not include the time to load the data from disk or sort the geometry on the CPU, as is generally required for Z-buffer based volume rendering. Therefore, real-time animation of a time-series would require pre-loading the data and pre-computing and pre-sorting the geometry for all frames. However, rendering the frames offline is also an option. Our goal in this work was not to maximize performance, but to match the appearance of real-world rheoscopic fluids. We regard performance issues as a matter of implementation, which merits future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Interpretation</head><p>In some cases, like the Taylor-Couette flow and thermocapillary flow, the results of our the VRF technique give clear and constructive information about the state of the flow. For example, the number and direction of rotation of the Taylor vortices can be derived directly from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6(a)</ref>. In other cases, like the natural convection case, discerning the meaning of the results can take a little more effort. As is often the case, it helps tremendously to interact directly with the volume rendering application, as 2D snapshots of the results can obscure internal structures that a little interactive rotation or translation can clarify.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Future Work</head><p>As already mentioned, improvements to our volume renderer will significantly reduce the visual artifacts and improve the performance of our method. We would also like to experiment more with the transparency transfer function in order to provide for more definition of the flow features under certain conditions. We believe more sophisticated transfer functions, both for better extraction of interesting structures and for improved image quality, can be constructed using the geometry shader on the most recent GPU hardware <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. We would also like to explore more datasets to better understand what types of flow problems are most clearly presented with the VRF technique.</p><p>Experimental work using rheoscopic fluids sometimes employs sheet illumination with lasers or incandescent light passed through a slit. This allows the experimentalist to see just a slice through the domain and extract detailed information about its interior structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. This is an interesting experimental tool that should be explored as well. Such a tool could also easily be extended to illumination with other surfaces since we are not limited computationally to light sources that can be physically constructed.</p><p>We also plan to investigate possible uses of the magnitude of the orientation vector derived in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>. As large values of n represent areas of high shear, and small values represent areas of low shear, there is an opportunist to use this information to provide further details of the flow to the researcher.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>The three problems for which we have shown results indicate that our Virtual Rheoscopic Fluid technique succeeds in emulating the experimental results of rheoscopic fluid flows. The advantages of having a computational equivalent to real rheoscopic fluids are significant. It allows CFD researchers to validate their fluid models and codes against real-world experiments in a way that purely computational techniques like streamlines cannot. It also gives CFD researchers a flow investigation tool which was previously available only to experimentalists. Furthermore, it opens up a large number of problems to visualization with rheoscopic fluids that are impractical or impossible to achieve in physical experiments. These would include problems where the fluid is a a gas, problems with large shear forces under which the behavior of the real rheoscopic platelets would break down <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and problems involving situations that cannot be tackled in the laboratory (e.g. ocean and atmospheric flows). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Published 14</head><label>14</label><figDesc>September 2007.</figDesc></figure>
