			<abstract>
				<p>Perfusion data are dynamic medical image data which characterize the regional blood flow in human tissue. These data bear a great potential in medical diagnosis, since diseases can be better distinguished and detected at an earlier stage compared to static image data. The widespread use of perfusion data is hampered by the lack of efficient evaluation methods. For each voxel, a time-intensity curve characterizes the enhancement of a contrast agent. Parameters derived from these curves characterize the perfusion and have to be integrated for diagnosis. The diagnostic evaluation of this multi-field data is challenging and time-consuming due to its complexity. For the visual analysis of such datasets, feature-based approaches allow to reduce the amount of data and direct the user to suspicious areas. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of perfusion data. For this purpose, we integrate statistical methods and interactive feature specification. Correlation analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are applied for dimension reduction and to achieve a better understanding of the inter-parameter relations. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions. The specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context style of visualization in 3D. We discuss our approach with respect to clinical datasets from the three major application areas: ischemic stroke diagnosis, breast tumor diagnosis, as well as the diagnosis of the coronary heart disease (CHD). It turns out that the significance of perfusion parameters strongly depends on the individual patient, scanning parameters, and data pre-processing.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Compared to static image data, where the morphology of anatomic and pathological structures is represented with high spatial resolution, dynamic image data characterize functional processes, such as metabolism and blood flow, which is often essential to detect diseases at an early stage or to discriminate pathologies with very similar morphology. Important examples of these data are functional MRI, where activations of brain areas are measured, dynamic SPECT, where metabolic processes are imaged, and perfusion imaging, where the blood flow is represented. We focus on perfusion data which are acquired to support essential diagnostic tasks, e.g., cerebral perfusion for stroke diagnosis, the assessment of tumors, and perfusion of the myocardium (heart muscle) for CHD diagnosis.</p><p>In perfusion imaging, the distribution of contrast agents (CA) is registered to assess blood flow and tissue kinetics. For each voxel, a time-intensity curve (TIC) characterizes the CA enhancement. How long it takes until the maximum amount of CA is delivered, which maximum is achieved, as well as other parameters are derived from these curves for medical diagnosis. The derived parameters represent a special instance of multi-field data which is becoming more and more important in medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. They are substitutes for physiological parameters such as tumor perfusion and vessel permeability <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The integrated analysis of several parameters in a suspicious region is essential. For the diagnosis of ischemic stroke, e.g., if the blood flow is delayed in a particular region, it is crucial to evaluate if the overall blood flow is also reduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</p><p>To streamline the integrated analysis of perfusion parameters, we present a visual analysis approach incorporating pre-processing and statistical methods as well as feature specification steps. Motion cor- rection and noise reduction are fundamental pre-processing issues to achieve a reliable correspondence of voxels over time. Since the different parameters are derived from the same TIC, it is likely that some parameters correlate with each other. We apply a correlation analysis and a PCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> to achieve a better understanding of the interparameter relations and to simplify and to speed-up the diagnosis by reducing the complexity of the multi-field data. Besides its complexity, the non-standardized parameter domain, which depends on the scanning protocol, complicates the diagnostic evaluation. For the visual analysis of such data, feature-based approaches allow to direct the user to suspicious regions and to reduce the amount of data. Our approach integrates methods for an interactive feature specification of high-dimensional complex features in multi-field data. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features which can be complex and/or hierarchically described by brushing multiple dimensions. Non-binary brushes account for the uncertainty involved in the inspection of a non-standardized parameter domain. Furthermore, they represent a natural mapping of irreversibly damaged or malignant tissue, suspicious or reversibly damaged tissue and healthy tissue to focus, near-focus and context. The specification result from all views is linked to a 3D view, establishing a focus+context style of visualization. The 3D representation of the perfusion parameters within their anatomic context allows a localization of the specification result. Our visual analysis approach primarily addresses medical researchers seeking for a better understanding of which perfusion parameters are crucial for specific diagnostic tasks and how imaging parameters influence the expressiveness of perfusion parameters. This research is motivated by contradictory recommendations in medical research papers, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> for CHD diagnosis.</p><p>This paper is structured as follows: In Sec. 2, we give an overview on the medical background in perfusion diagnosis and on correlation analysis and PCA. Prior and related work on the application of Info-Vis techniques for the analysis of multi-field data as well as on the visual analysis of perfusion data are presented in Sec. 3. In Sec. 4, we describe our analysis approach. The application of the approach to clinical perfusion datasets from ischemic stroke diagnosis, breast tumor diagnosis, and CHD diagnosis, is discussed in Sec. 5. The last section will summarize and conclude the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">MEDICAL AND TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</head><p>This section gives a brief overview on perfusion diagnosis and acquaints the reader with the basics of correlation analysis and PCA. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Perfusion Diagnosis</head><p>In perfusion imaging, a CA is injected intravenously and its distribution is measured by a repeated acquisition of subsequent images covering the volume of interest. The CA provides signal changes in the acquired 4D data (3D+time). In case of a perfusion defect, the corresponding region exhibits an abnormal change in signal intensities. The spatial resolution and quality of perfusion data are worse than those of static data. High temporal resolution can only be achieved at the expense of lower spatial resolution and image quality.</p><p>Particularly CT, PET, SPECT and MRI data are employed for perfusion imaging. In the following, we only consider MR perfusion, since MRI is the most widespread perfusion imaging technique for breast tumor diagnosis. It outperforms CT in stroke diagnosis, since the entire brain can be scanned (instead of a single slice with CT) and it has shown to have at least a similar sensitivity and specificity in comparison to PET and SPECT in CHD diagnosis.</p><p>Perfusion Parameters. For the diagnosis, regions of interest in healthy and suspicious tissue are defined, and TICs-averaged over all voxels in the selected region-are analyzed. Depending on the application area, different sets of parameters, derived from the curves, are relevant. However, some parameters are of general interest (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>). Before we describe these parameters, we introduce three parameters necessary for a reliable evaluation.</p><p>The CA arrival represents the point in time when the signal enhancement actually starts, whereas Time End refers to the end of the first CA passage. The Baseline represents the average intensity before CA arrival (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>). These parameters are determined to focus the evaluation of the TIC to the relevant portion. Assessing perfusion considering the actual CA arrival, Time End and the Baseline is essential to compare analysis results from different scanning devices and patients. Major diagnostically relevant parameters are:</p><p>• Peak Enhancement (PE). The maximum value (between CA arrival and Time End ) normalized by subtracting the Baseline. The PE separates the time interval between CA arrival and Time End into a phase of CA wash-in followed by the CA wash-out.</p><p>• Time To Peak (TTP). The time until PE occurs, normalized by subtracting CA arrival time. This parameter allows to assess if the blood supply is delayed in a particular region.</p><p>• Integral. For the time interval between CA arrival and Time End , the area between the curve and the Baseline-the approximated integral-is computed. Together, PE and Integral may give a hint on reduced blood flow.</p><p>• Mean Transit Time (MTT). In the time interval used for the integral calculation, MT T specifies the first momentum of the curve. It is normalized by subtracting CA arrival time.</p><p>• The Slope characterizes the steepness of the curve during washin. Depending on the temporal resolution, different regression methods are used to characterize the curve progression. The term Up-Slope in cardiac diagnosis relates to the maximum slope between two or three subsequent time-steps during wash-in. In tumor perfusion studies, the related parameter MiTR (Maximum intensity to Time Ratio) is determined; it is computed as PE/T T P and it is thus an average slope.</p><p>• The DownSlope characterizes the steepness of the descending curve during wash-out and is computed similar to the Slope, however, with a negative sign.</p><p>The parameters are derived per voxel and stored in separate parameter volumes (3D). As a major pre-processing step, noise reduction is often solved by conventional filters, such as Gaussian. Lysaker et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> introduced a filter for 4D data that better preserves features based on the simulation of a diffusion process. Motion-correction is the second major pre-processing task, carried out to establish a valid inter-pixel correspondence. It is essential when breathing, heartbeat, patient movement, or muscle relaxation occur. The motion correction algorithm developed by Rueckert et al. is widely used <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Correlation and Principal Component Analysis</head><p>Correlation analysis reveals whether variables vary independently of each other or are (inversely) proportional. The amount of correlation is represented by the so-called correlation coefficient (r). In the following, we assume a matrix A m×n representing n variables (perfusion parameters) and m observations (voxels of the parameter volumes). The symmetric matrix R n×n of correlation coefficients is then computed based on the covariance matrix C of A. A value of r i j = −1 indicates a perfect inversely proportional relationship, whereas a value of r i j = 1 corresponds to a perfect proportional relationship. A value of r i j = 0 relates to non-correlated variables. Besides R, an equally-sized symmetric matrix P of p-values is computed for testing the hypothesis of no correlation. If a particular p-value is &lt; 0.05, the correlation is considered significant. Müller et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> suggest that the user may exclude variables from a PCA that strongly correlate with each other. Otherwise, these variables might misleadingly strengthen certain trends.</p><p>The PCA is a technique from multivariate statistics to detect variables from multi-dimensional data that may be redundant. For dimension reduction, these variables may be grouped together. Furthermore, PCA explains the structure of relationships between variables and thus provides additional insight into the data. The PCA results in new variables, the so-called principal components. Each principal component (pc) represents a single axis in a new orthogonal coordinate space (pcspace)-generated by a variance maximum rotation of the original data space. The first pc (pc1) explains most of the variance in the original data, the second pc (pc2) most of the remaining variance, etc.</p><p>Before applying a PCA, it is often reasonable to standardize the data. This is necessary, if the variables have not been measured in the same units or if their variance is substantial. For standardization, A is centered around its mean and then each column of A is divided by its standard deviation. This step is often referred to as Auto-scaling. One way to compute the pc's is to apply a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). As a result, the SVD returns matrices PCS n×n , scores m×n and a vector containing the eigenvalues λ 1×n of C. Each column of PCS consists of n loadings representing the weights for the linear combination of the n original variables. The scores are the coordinates of the original data transformed into pc-space. The vector λ represents the variances explained by the n pc's.</p><p>According to Müller et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, the PCA results may be exploited in several ways, e.g., to detect prominent trends in the data. These trends are represented by the pc's. The loadings indicate how individual variables correlate with these trends. The eigenvalues of C may be applied to neglect less significant trends (low values correspond to a low variance explained by the corresponding pc). A major problem involved in interpreting PCA results is the difficulty to relate trends to the original variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. Therefore, Müller et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> suggest to oppose the scores and the original variables in a scatterplot. Another approach they recommend is to present the scores in their spatial frame of reference (the original perfusion data). Furthermore, linking &amp; brushing should be applied to relate the scores to the original variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PRIOR AND RELATED WORK</head><p>This section describes prior and related work on the application of InfoVis techniques for the analysis of multi-field data as well as on the visual analysis of perfusion data.</p><p>Visual Exploration of Multi-field Data. Our visualization concepts extend ideas from general systems for analyzing and exploring multidimensional image data such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. Due to the absence of standardized intensity values and the high variability of image scanners and patient data, the analysis of perfusion is a typical exploratory analysis task where visual data mining techniques are essential.</p><p>Closely related concepts were presented by Gresh and Rogowitz in the WEAVE system <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. In particular, we employ their concept of tightly integrating a 3D visualization with multiple statistical representations, connected by brushing facilities applied to scatterplot representations. Similar to their exploratory scenarios, we also attempt to quickly compare and correlate variables. Inspired by their approach, Doleisch et al. developed the SimVis framework for interactive feature specification for CFD data in previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the concepts of Gresh and Rogowitz have been optimized for the interactive work with very large medical multi-field datasets and extended by the integration of analysis techniques from pattern classification.</p><p>Visual Exploration of Perfusion Data. Basic visualization techniques for exploring perfusion data were described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> (focus on tumor perfusion) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> (focus on cerebral perfusion). The cinematic depiction of gray scale images in a movie loop gives an impression of the enhancement pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Subtraction images depict the intensity difference between two selected points in time, thus, emphasizing regions where the CA is absorbed. However, they do not provide quantitative temporal and spatial information, which could make the diagnostic results more reproducible. Color-coded parameter maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> reveal the regional distribution of selected perfusion parameters. However, the analysis of parameter combinations in a tiled visualization requires a mental integration of suspicious regions.</p><p>Multiparameter visualizations, integrating several perfusion parameters in one image, were introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. Different kinds of multivariate color scales, color icons and colored height fields were discussed. Flexible lenses were used to integrate the visualization of a foreground parameter (in the lens region) with a background parameter. In particular for Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI Mammography (DCE-MRIM) data with its high spatial resolution, direct volume rendering techniques have been explored. A color-coded Closest Vessel Projection was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. Coto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> employ two-level volume rendering and importance driven volume rendering to focus volume rendered images to previously segmented breast lesions. This work is the closest to our work since also linking &amp; brushing was employed to select regions of interest. However, they did not consider the perfusion parameters described in Sec. 2.1. Instead, they only considered the intensity values and the enhancement in a subtraction image. The application profile flags presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> may be used to immediately integrate TICs into a visualization, thus supporting the mental integration of the curve parameters and the display of the original perfusion data. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> describe highly interactive 3D visualizations of DCE-MRIM data in a virtual reality environment.</p><p>Analysis of Perfusion Data. Another venue of analyzing perfusion data relates to a statistical analysis as well as mining and knowledge discovery techniques. In particular, the classification of DCE-MRIM data by means of artificial neural networks and clustering techniques is an active research area <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>. As an example, Twellmann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> applied an artificial neural network architecture which combines unsupervised and supervised techniques for voxel-by-voxel classification of temporal kinetic signals derived from DCE-MRIM data. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> developed a fuzzy c-means clustering-based technique to automatically identify characteristic kinetic curves from segmented breast lesions in DCE-MRIM data. Nattkemper and Wissmueller <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> described the application of self-organized maps to time curve features of DCE-MRIM data and discussed how the results may be visually represented as color-coded cross-sections. The automatic classification may be useful in a screening setting in order to replace the opinion of a second radiologist or to direct a radiologist to suspicious regions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">A PERFUSION DATA ANALYSIS APPROACH</head><p>This section describes our visual analysis approach independent of a specific application area. However, the included figures have been generated based on cerebral perfusion data to illustrate the approach by means of a real-world example (see also Sec. 5.1).</p><p>The approach consists of three major components (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>): a pre-processing component, a component for statistical analysis, and a component for interactive feature specification in multi-field data. For the work presented here, these components have each been implemented in MeVisLab 1 , a platform for medical image processing and visualization, MATLAB 2 , and the framework SimVis 3 . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Pre-processing</head><p>The original 4D perfusion data serves as input for the pre-processing component. Here, the data is noise reduced applying a Gaussian kernel and motion-corrected according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. The separate time points (3D data) are exported and may, e.g., serve as context information during the visual analysis. For some applications, such as ischemic stroke or CHD diagnosis, it is useful to restrict the computation of perfusion parameters to relevant structures (brain tissue or ventricles of the heart). A variety of segmentation algorithms has been integrated into MeVisLab. The perfusion parameters are derived voxel-wise for the segmented regions and exported separately as parameter volumes. These volumes serve as input for the feature specification as well as for the statistical component. The segmentation part may be skipped, if the entire dataset must be analyzed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Statistical Analysis</head><p>At the beginning of the statistical analysis, the user is presented a list containing the perfusion parameters which have been approved in his or her diagnostic field of interest (see Sec. 5.1-5.3). The user may refine this initial set resulting in a new set {P k } of k parameters. In a next step, the background voxels within the parameter volumes corresponding to {P k } are identified to restrict further computations to the anatomic structures. Based on the histogram of one of these parameter volumes, the background voxels are identified (the highest peak in the histogram) and excluded from further analysis (Background removal). The decision may be refined by defining a threshold. The indices of the remaining m voxels VOX relev are stored in a vector ID relev . Then, the perfusion parameter matrix A m×k is constructed considering only the voxels referred to by ID relev . As discussed in Sec. 2.2, the PCA may require a standardization of its input to deliver meaningful results. Since the perfusion parameters have not been measured in the same units, Auto-scaling is applied to A resulting in A m×k std . To evaluate the relationships between several parameters, a correlation analysis is carried out resulting in matrices R and P. In order to consider only significant correlations, P is examined for values &lt; 0.05. The correlation coefficients in R corresponding to the remaining values are set to 0 (no correlation). A visual representation of R now enables the user to identify parameters that are highly correlated (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>). A scatterplot matrix is generated by plotting all columns in A std against each other. The background color of each plot has been chosen according to the respective value in R. A color scale has been designed that visually separates negative and positive coefficients. Furthermore, it emphasizes strong correlations (coefficients &lt; −0.9 or &gt; 0.9). The diagonal of the scatterplot matrix shows a histogram for each parameter. All axes limits are set based on the respective inner quartile range such that outlier values are not displayed. The visualization of R in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> shows the following strong correlations: Integral ↔ PE, PE ↔ MiT R, PE ↔ Slope, Slope ↔ MiT R and Slope ↔ DownSlope (inversely proportional). Since parameters PE and Slope strongly correlate with three other parameters respectively, they may be excluded from further processing. This results in the Matrix A m×l corr , where l is the number of remaining parameters. In a next step, a PCA is carried out based on A corr resulting in the matrices PCS l×l , scores m×l and a vector λ 1×l (recall Sec. 2.2). To detect trends in the data, the loadings in PCS are visualized in a bar chart (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4, crosshatched bars)</ref>. However, the PCA does not only reveal the trends but it orders them by their significance-expressed by the variances in λ . To incorporate this significance in the visualization, the loadings in column i, i ∈ [1, l] of PCS are weighted with λ (1, i) according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref>, filled bars). The plot in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref> reveals a major trend represented by pc1. This trend is determined by the parameters Integral, DownSlope and MiT R. The positive loadings of Integral and MiT R indicate a direct proportional relationship, whereas the negative loading of DownSlope indicates an inversely proportional relationship. To relate the trends to the original perfusion parameters, their scores are exported for a later processing within the feature specification component.</p><p>The end of the statistical analysis constitutes a classification step which has not yet been implemented. However, related work indicates that in particular techniques to classify DCE-MRIM data are promising to detect suspicious regions (see Sec. 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Feature Specification</head><p>The interactive feature specification of data coming from the preprocessing as well as from the statistical analysis stage of our approach is carried out in a framework employing the SimVis technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. SimVis was previously developed for the analysis of 3D timedependent flow simulation data, but has recently been extended to cope also with multiple other data types, e.g., 3D weather radar data and 3D medical data. A data converter has been implemented to transform medical RAW data into the SimVis data-format.</p><p>In SimVis, multiple linked views are used to concurrently show, explore, and analyze different aspects of multi-field data. 3D views of the volume (also over time) can be used next to several types of attribute views, e.g., scatterplots or histograms. Interactive feature specification is usually performed in these attribute views. The user chooses to visually represent selected data attributes in such a view, thereby gaining insight into the selected relations within the data. Then, the interesting subsets of the data are interactively brushed directly on the screen (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5(b)</ref> for an example). The result of such a brushing operation is reintegrated into the data in form of a synthetic data attribute DOI j ∈ [0, 1] (degree of interest (DOI) attribution of the data, compare to Furnas <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>). This DOI attribution is used in the 3D views of the analysis setup to visually discriminate the interactively specified features from the rest of the data in a focus+context visualization style which is consistent in all (linked) views <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>.</p><p>In the SimVis system smooth brushing <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> (enabling fractional DOI values) as well as the logical combination of brushes for the specification of complex features <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> are supported. A smooth brush results in a trapezoidal DOI function around the main region of interest in the attribute views. To enable the integration of a flexible derived data concept, a data calculator module with a respective graphical user interface has been added. New attributes can be derived from existing ones and thereafter are available for investigation in all linked views.</p><p>There are several different purposes of the interactive feature specification process and the resulting exploration and analysis steps, of which the most important are: As a result, the infarction core is revealed in (a) applying T T P for color-coding. In (d), a near-focus region (arrows point at its borders) is defined by means of smooth brushing. The updated visualization in (c) gives a hint on the location of "tissue at risk" (greenish area). In (e), the brain is rotated to gain a better impression of the over-all extension of the infarction in 3D. Furthermore, the shape of the brain is indicated by a smooth brushing applied on the gradient magnitude computed from a single time point of the perfusion data (f). Interestingly, a smooth brushing of the scores of pc1 and pc2 (h) yields a very similar result (g) compared to (c). The brown lines in (h) represent the zero-axes.</p><p>• Feature localization: to search for places in the 3D domain of the data where certain feature characteristics are present. In the SimVis approach, the user can brush features in attribute views and concurrently localize the respective feature in the 4D (3D+time) volume domain.</p><p>• Multi-variate analysis: to investigate multi-variate data properties by specifying a feature in one attribute view and at the same time analyzing the DOI distribution with respect to other data attributes in other attribute views (through view linking).</p><p>• Local investigation: to inspect the values of selected data attributes with respect to certain spatiotemporal subsets of the 3D volume domain. In the SimVis system, the user can also load spatial as well as temporal data references into attribute viewsbrushing these kinds of data attributes then yields features which are specified according to their spatiotemporal extents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">APPLICATION</head><p>Our perfusion data analysis approach has been applied to 5 datasets so far (1 from ischemic stroke diagnosis, 2 from breast tumor diagnosis and 2 from CHD diagnosis).

In cerebral perfusion, the first-pass of the CA (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>) is observed. The volume of blood in each voxel is diagnostically relevant. It is approximated by the parameter Integral. Other approved parameters are PE, TTP, MTT and Slope <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Case Study. The patient suffered from an infarction in the right hemisphere (which appears left in each view of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref>). The dataset matrix is: 128 × 128, slice distance: 7 mm, number of slices: 12, temporal resolution: 40 measurements in 40 sec.</p><p>Statistical analysis. The results of the statistical analysis are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figs. 3-4</ref>. First, we added DownSlope and MiT R to the default parameter set. The correlation coefficients then indicated strong correlations (recall Sec. 4.2): between parameters describing the amount of the enhancement (Integral ↔ PE), between parameters describing the velocity of the enhancement (Slope ↔ MiT R, Slope ↔ DownSlope), and in between these types (PE ↔ MiT R, PE ↔ Slope). The correlation between Slope and DownSlope is inversely proportional. Since the DownSlope is measured in negative values, this indicates that a fast wash-in (high Slope values) is likely to be followed by a fast wash-out (high negative DownSlope values). Since PE and Slope strongly correlate with three other parameters respectively, they have been excluded from further processing.</p><p>The PCA showed four major trends (pc1-pc4) which account for 52% + 29% + 11% + 7% = 99% of the variance in the data. A problem when interpreting PCA results is to assign a meaning to the newly generated coordinate axes. According to Müller et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, we label the axes with respect to the parameters that determine the trend in the respective pc. More meaningful labels could be "Amount and Velocity" for pc1 and "Time to Enhancement" for pc2. Interestingly, the trends represented by pc3 and pc4 characterize atypical enhancement behavior and conflict with pc2 and pc1, respectively (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref>). This observation has been further investigated and the results are presented on the website mentioned above. Visual analysis. A crucial task in stroke diagnosis is to localize the infarction core and especially the surrounding "tissue at risk". <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref> shows how visual analysis may guide this process. In a scatterplot, T T P and Integral are opposed and a region is brushed that indicates delayed and diminished perfusion <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 5 (b)</ref>). As a result of this feature localization, the infarction core appears as a bright region <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 5 (a)</ref>). High T T P values are mapped to colors from yellow to red. Smooth brushing now gives a hint on "tissue at risk" <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 5 (d)</ref>). A near-focus region is defined (arrows point at its borders) incorporating areas where the perfusion is delayed as well, however, enough blood arrives over time. Candidate areas for "tissue at risk" appear greenish (medium T T P values) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5 (c)</ref>. This observation could be successfully validated with <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> where the same dataset has been examined. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref> (e), the brain has been rotated to illustrate the over-all extension of the infarction. Furthermore, the shape of the brain is indicated as context information. Latter has been achieved by a smooth brushing of the gradient magnitude computed based on the intensity values from a single time point of the original perfusion data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 5 (f)</ref>). This technique will be used throughout the paper. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5 (h)</ref>, the scores of pc1 and pc2 have been opposed. As discussed above, meaningful axes labels could be "Amount and Velocity" and "Time to Enhancement". Hence, small values on the x-axis and high values on the y-axis are brushed. The near-focus region is selected accordingly. A comparison of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5 (g)</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5 (c)</ref> shows that the revealed areas match closely. Hence, the trends expressed by pc1 and pc2 together facilitate the detection of infarcted tissue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Breast Tumor Diagnosis</head><p>The major diagnostic task in breast tumor diagnosis is to assess the malignancy of a tumor. Evaluating the shape of the TICs has proven to be effective in the differentiation of enhancing lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. Parameters that describe the shape are MTT, MiTR, PE, Slope, DownSlope, TTP and Integral. Curves-which show a rapid wash-in followed by a rapid wash-out-are especially suspicious because they indicate strong perfusion and high permeability of vessels. Less suspicious are curves showing a plateau later on, or regions which continue to enhance.</p><p>Case Study. The data was acquired to examine a suspicious region in the right mamma which had been detected during conventional mammography. The dataset matrix is: 458×204, slice distance: 3 mm, number of slices: 26, temporal resolution: 6 measurements in 10 min.</p><p>Statistical analysis. Two extra parameters describing the steepness of the curve during wash-in and wash-out have been added to the default parameter set. Each of them was computed between two particular time points selected by the user. A strong correlation between Integral and PE as well as between PE and Slope was found. Since PE strongly correlates with two other parameters, it has been excluded from further processing. The PCA showed four major trends expressed by pc1-pc4. All together account for ≈ 91% of the variance in the data. In the following, the focus is on a streamlined localization and separation of suspicious structures for local investigation.</p><p>Visual analysis. Subtraction images emphasize regions where the CA is absorbed (see Sec. 3). Hence, additional parameters have been derived based on the original time points in the perfusion data. Each parameter describes the intensity difference between two subsequent time points t j and t i , where j &gt; i. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6 (b)</ref>, high differences in intensity between time points t 2 and t 0 have been selected (Selection1). The corresponding areas are emphasized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6 (a)</ref>. The structure S large had already been detected in conventional mammography. Furthermore, a smaller structure S small is revealed close to the thoracic wall. Besides these structures, major vessels and the acromastium are emphasized. To focus the analysis on a region around S large for local investigation, Euclidean distances between its center and the surrounding tissue are computed. Then, a range of distance values (Selection1 1 ) within Selection1 is brushed such that the local region LR around S large includes S small . The definition of a local region around S large is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6 (c,d)</ref>. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6 (f)</ref>, Selection1 1 (red bars) is transferred to a histogram of parameter DownSlope for multi-variate analysis. High negative values indicating a rapid washout are typical for malignant tumors. Hence, this range has been selected within Selection1 1 by excluding positive and small negative values with the help of a negative brush (purple box). The result is color-coded by means of parameter Slope in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6</ref> (e). S large and In this case, T T P is not a reliable parameter to detect the infarcted tissue since the selection is spread over its entire codomain (red dots). However, this may not be valid for another dataset as illustrated in (e-f) for Heart 2 . A selection of high T T P values and small Up-Slope values (f) reveals the infarcted tissue (green area in (e)). Brushing the scores of pc2 (h), which represents an atypical enhancement pattern, exhibits areas where the motion-correction and thus the segmentation of the myocardium have partially failed (g).</p><p>S small both exhibit regions with a rapid wash-in and wash-out and are thus likely to be malignant. S small partially shows small Slope values which should be further investigated. Another indication that confirms the suspicion of malignancy is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6 (g-h)</ref>. A smooth brushing of high and medium Slope values within LR shows subtle jags (so-called spikulae) along the border of S large . The observations in this section could be validated by means of a report from an experienced radiologist who supposed that S small forms a satellite lesion connected to S large by one of the spikulae.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">CHD Diagnosis</head><p>In CHD diagnosis, the detection and localization of a perfusion deficit as well as the assessment of the severity are relevant. Major diagnostic tasks to be performed are to evaluate whether the patient suffers from CHD, to evaluate the severity of the disease and to assess the vascular supply of less perfused tissue. At an early stage, CHD is characterized by a perfusion defect caused by a stenosis (an abnormal vessel narrowing). For CHD diagnosis, the parameters Up-Slope, PE, TTP and Integral have been approved <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Case Study. The two patients both suffered from a heart attack. The matrix of dataset Heart 1 is: 144 × 192, slice distance: 18 mm, number of slices: 4, temporal resolution: 40 measurements in 38 sec. The matrix of dataset Heart 2 is: 144 × 192, slice distance: 18 mm, number of slices: 3, temporal resolution: 40 measurements in 23 sec.</p><p>Statistical analysis. First, MiT R has been added to the default parameter set. The correlation coefficients for Heart 1 and Heart 2 indicated a strong correlation between Integral and PE. Due to the higher variance of the Integral values in both cases, PE was excluded from the PCA. The PCA of Heart 1 showed two major trends in pc1 and pc2, respectively <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 7 (a)</ref>). Both pc's together explain ≈ 91% of the variance in the data. However, pc1 describes an atypical enhancement pattern. In damaged tissue, the blood flow is delayed (high T T P values) and diminished (low Integral values). However, pc1 indicates a proportional relationship which will be examined below.</p><p>The PCA of Heart 2 showed three major trends expressed by pc1 to pc3. All together account for 51% + 25% + 17% = 93% of the vari-ance in the data. For the sake of brevity, only the first two pc's are examined here <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 7 (a)</ref>). A typical enhancement pattern is represented by pc1. However, pc2 shows an atypical pattern. As in pc1 of Heart 1 , T T P is proportional to Integral and Up-Slope. Furthermore, MiT R is inversely proportional to Up-Slope though both parameters describe the steepness of the curve during wash-in.</p><p>Visual analysis. To examine the atypical enhancement pattern represented by pc1 of Heart 1 , the scores of pc1 have been brushed in a histogram <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 7 (b)</ref>). A selection of high values reveals the infarcted tissue (green region in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7 (c)</ref>) within the ring-shaped myocardium. Since the circular shape of the myocardium hampers the orientation, context information has been added. Two arrows point at the right ventricle (left arrow) and the lumen of the left ventricle (right arrow). The selection from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7 (b)</ref> has been transferred for a multi-variate analysis to a scatterplot opposing T T P and Up-Slope (red dots in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7  (d)</ref>). Interestingly, the infarcted tissue is spread over all time points. Probing the TICs within the infarcted region showed that the acquisition time of the scan was too short to determine a reliable T T P. In the infarcted region, no CA arrived at all over time. However, PE and therefore T T P always exist-no matter if the TIC represents CA enhancement or noise. After all, it seems that in spite of the unreliable T T P values a brushing of the scores of pc1 still delivers meaningful results. This might be due to the low loading of T T P <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 7 (a)</ref>).</p><p>A major difficulty in analyzing perfusion data is that the reliability of a parameter may change from case to case. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7</ref> (a, e, f), T T P might be a reliable parameter for feature localization in Heart 2 . Brushing of high T T P and small Up-Slope values reveals the infarcted region (green). Here, pc1 describes a typical enhancement pattern. In contrast, pc2 describes an atypical pattern: T T P and Integral are proportional, and Up-Slope and MiT R are inversely proportional related. Brushing of extreme values of pc2 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 7 (h)</ref>) reveals areas at the transitions between myocardium and lumen and myocardium and pericardium ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7 (g)</ref>). Further examination showed that the propagation of the segmented myocardial contours did not match the myocardium at all time points (recall para. Pre-processing in Sec. 5). It turned out that the motion correction had partially failed.</p><p>We presented the integration of pre-processing techniques, statistical methods, and interactive feature specification for the analysis of the multi-dimensional space of perfusion parameters. The visual analysis strategy presented here allows to assess the reliability of specific perfusion parameters, the correlation of perfusion parameters in a particular case, and thus enables an efficient evaluation focused on a significant subset of perfusion parameters. The statistical analysis facilitates the detection of trends in the data. Trends, representing typical enhancement patterns, may be applied for the detection of suspicious structures while trends, representing atypical enhancement patterns, may indicate pre-processing failures. We discussed our approach with two experienced radiologists, both familiar with perfusion imaging in the clinical routine, though not in a research context. Both argued that the statistical analysis is only applicable in the clinical routine-in particular in emergency cases-if carried out in the background leading to an initial suggestion for suspicious regions. We will investigate this in our future work. Both assessed brushing as valuable for exploring a non-standardized parameter domain. They appreciated the visualization of perfusion data in 3D since it provides a good overview.</p><p>Compared to the prevailing visual and highly subjective evaluation methods, our approach enables a more reproducible evaluation supported by quantitative analysis results. Thus, it may be used to answer questions regarding the diagnostic value of certain parameter combinations and to investigate the effects of a new contrast agent or changes in other imaging parameters on this value. Such questions are debated in the medical research. The most important work to be done relates to a thorough evaluation for a larger number of specific cases in cerebral, tumor, and myocardial perfusion. Within such an evaluation, the perfusion data analysis and clinical parameters characterizing the progress of the respective disease have to be integrated to better understand the diagnostic value of perfusion parameters.</p><p>SimVis has been designed to work with data laid out on arbitrary grids. An overhead of neighborhood information is generated for medical data laid out on Cartesian grids. This overhead hampered an interactive analysis in case of DCE-MRIM data exhibiting a high spatial resolution. Techniques from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> will be investigated to resolve this limitation. With respect to the analysis strategy, the incorporation of clustering techniques which classify regions according to the similarity of TICs, deserves a systematic investigation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Published 14</head><label>14</label><figDesc>September 2007.</figDesc></figure>
