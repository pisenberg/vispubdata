				<p>Scientific visualization and illustration tools are designed to help people understand the structure and complexity of scientific data with images that are as informative and intuitive as possible. In this context the use of metaphors plays an important role since they make complex information easily accessible by using commonly known concepts. In this paper we propose a new metaphor, called &quot;Topological Landscapes,&quot; which facilitates understanding the topological structure of scalar functions. The basic idea is to construct a terrain with the same topology as a given dataset and to display the terrain as an easily understood representation of the actual input data. In this projection from an n-dimensional scalar function to a two-dimensional (2D) model we preserve function values of critical points, the persistence (function span) of topological features, and one possible additional metric property (in our examples volume). By displaying this topologically equivalent landscape together with the original data we harness the natural human proficiency in understanding terrain topography and make complex topological information easily accessible.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Scalar functions are an ubiquitous type of scientific data used to represent a wide variety of phenomena in application areas including chemistry, climate modeling, medicine, and physics. One of the fundamental tasks in scientific visualization is to provide users with a correct general understanding of data complexity and structure and to determine (i) if any major unexpected features may be present, and (ii) at which locations there may be a greater need for interactive exploration and detailed data analysis.</p><p>Classical approaches providing a quick overview of data include displaying multiple isosurfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> or the use of direct volume rendering with varying transfer functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However, such techniques only show a small sub-set of the data in any one image and depend heavily on parameter selection. This requires users to combine information from a potentially large number of images. Furthermore, it is usually impractical to interactively explore the complete parameter space.</p><p>To complement direct visualizations, histograms of various type and dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> have been proposed to reduce the time spent on trial and error data exploration. Such methods are most successful when used in conjunction with direct visualization. Direct visualization is very intuitive and familiar to users while histograms provide an overview of the data with respect to one or multiple parameters. However, the effectiveness of histograms is often limited as they only provide aggregate global information, are not localized spatially, and often machine learning techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> are necessary to utilize their full potential.</p><p>An alternate approach to understanding the structure of a function is to compute its topology, for example, by extracting its contour tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. This type of analysis provides a complete study of the variation of a function and describes all its features and their location in space either in terms of critical points <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> or in terms of entire regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Moreover, one can compute additional properties, such as area/volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> or genus <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, that further quantify the shape of isosurfaces in a particular region. Knowledge of this complete and accurate information can enhance and guide standard visualization techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</p><p>Topological information is very abstract and difficult to expose to a user. Direct visualization of a contour tree in a linked view system has been tried <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> and proven to be a powerful interface for data exploration. However, its usage is still hampered by presenting the topological information as a graph, which is difficult for a user to relate to the structure of a scalar field.</p><p>In this paper, we take a classical approach to facilitate the understanding of complex scientific information by developing metaphors that leverage human intuition <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In particular, we propose a terrain metaphor for presenting the topological information provided by contour trees together with additional metric information associated with its branches, e.g., the volume associated with each topological feature. Given a contour tree, possibly with metric information, we create a terrain that we call topological landscape with the same topology as the original data. This process can be thought of as the inverse operation of the classical construction of a contour tree from a scalar field. In this projection from the topology to a terrain we preserve function values, persistence and nesting of critical points, as well as an additional metric property attached to each arc that we map to the areas of the corresponding regions This new visual metaphor takes advantage of the fact that humans are naturally trained and very effective in understanding the structure of a terrain. Furthermore, one can combine topological information with additional properties at the level of individual components, something not easily achieved in a graph model. In fact, Carr et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> compute the metric information at the level of individual components, simplify the tree based on this individual information, yet still present it to the user clustered in a spectrum-like interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The structure of terrains, on the other hand, is easy to grasp and has long been used to illustrate topological concepts. In this paper we show how to harness this intuition to illustrate the behavior of general scalar functions.</p><p>Naturally, topological landscapes are not meant to replace the detailed representation of direct rendering methods, other histograms, or more advanced graph models. We believe, instead, that their ability to provide a complete and yet intuitive overview of the data fills an important gap in data exploration process and constitutes a valuable addition to an advanced used interface. In particular, the main contributions of this work include: (i) Introducing the concept of topological landscapes as a new metaphor for presenting the structure of a given scalar function f ; (ii) Providing a method to construct a terrain whose contour tree is identical to that of f ; (iii) Demonstrating how an adaptive refinement of the terrain based solely on 4-8 subdivision rules reproduces a correct topological approximation of f ; (iv) Re-balancing contour trees to reduce their height; (v) Providing a multi-scale method for optimizing the mesh such that the area of each feature in the topological landscape is approximately proportional to the desired metric property; and (vi) Presenting examples that demonstrate the expressive power of topological landscapes.</p><p>Published 14 September 2007.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Even though topological methods have been used by the graphics and visualization community for more than fifteen years <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> and were developed much earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> few techniques aim to improve the presentation of topological information. Some topological structures, such as the Morse-Smale complex and the topological segmentations of vector fields, have natural embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. However, they are difficult to compute and in three dimensions (3D) suffer from significant occlusion problems. In scalar field visualization the most widely used topological structure is the contour tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, which is an abstract graph without inherent embedding. Pascucci et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> proposed the toporrery to layout and render hierarchical contour trees. The toporrery improves rendering times and overall layout significantly, yet the contour tree remains an abstract graph that is difficult to comprehend. Mizuta et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> represent the nesting structure of a contour tree using a color image of nested rectangles. This method is effective at representing the nesting of features, yet gives no indication of the function values involved and/or the size and importance of the features.</p><p>A more common approach to using structural information in visualization is to enhance standard techniques such as isosurfaces and volume rendering <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> with, for example, topological information. Fujishiro et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> rendered translucent isosurfaces representing all possible isosurface topologies and used the result to automate transfer function design <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Similar approaches that use topological information to quickly find regions of interested have been proposed by Pascucci and Cole-McLaughlin <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and Weber at al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Takahashi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> proposed using topology based interval volumes to explore datasets.</p><p>Another set of methods expose structural information more directly to the user, either in form of histograms or as abstract graphs. Bajaj et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> introduced the contour spectrum, which aids users in the selection of appropriate isovalues by providing a histogram showing isosurface properties, such as area and enclosed volume as a function of the isovalue. Kettner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> extended this interface to higher dimensions and further considered properties, such as number of contours that are not decomposable. Carr et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref> computed similar properties, but do so on a per contour bases. The results are used to guide the simplification of the contour tree, which in turn is used to simplify isosurfaces and provide a more flexible, contour centric interface.</p><p>Topological landscapes can been seen as a more powerful version of such interfaces that map topological properties of higher-dimensional datasets to topological properties of two-dimensional terrains <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. Rather than showing the abstract contour tree (albeit simplified by geometric measures) as proposed by Carr et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> or showing only metric properties like Bajaj et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> topological landscapes combine this information into single intuitive interface.</p><p>To reflect a metric property, e.g., the enclosed volume, in the topological landscape we adapt the initial terrain, see Section 4.1, such that the areas of a feature become proportional to the enclosed volume of their corresponding isosurfaces, see Section 4.3. This is related to the construction of continuous cartograms <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref> where the goal is to adjust the layout of a given map according to a set of weights with minimal shape distortion. Depending on additional constraints, such as shape or neighborhood preservation, there exist different flavors of the problem and we refer the reader to the paper by Keim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> for complete definitions and a list of additional references. In general, solutions are based on formulating a non-linear energy function that incorporates the shape and weight error and optimizing this energy. House and Kocmoud <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> used a large spring system for optimization that produces good results but is computationally expensive. Keim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> divided their entire map into sections between a set of scanlines and scaled each section either along or perpendicular of each scanline. The restriction to small localized updates makes this algorithm comparatively fast. However, the quality is strongly dependent on the placement of the scanlines and the best results are achieved with manual placement. Finally, Heilmann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> reduced the dimensionality of the problem by restricting all regions to be rectangular. . The number of contours of an isosurface changes as the isovalue is swept thought the function range: After hitting a minimum, one contour is created (a). A new contour inside the existing contour is created around a second minimum. For a higher value, these two contours merge into a single contour (c). As the isovalues increases, this contour splits in two independent contours (d), which in turn both split (e), (f) until there are four contours. As the isovalue is further increased, these four contours are destroyed. We do not track genus changes that occur between split events, e.g., the hole forming in the upper component The resulting reduced problem is solved using genetic programming. While all these solutions are related, and in particular the RecMap approach seems applicable (since all our initial regions are squares), there exist important details that make them impractical in our case. To preserve contour tree topology, our neighborhood constraints are absolute. As shown in Section 4, the initial layout is carefully chosen to preserve topology and two regions changing neighborhood status (either becoming neighbors or no longer being neighbors) is likely to change topology. Second, our regions are defined hierarchically and therefore even more inter-dependent than in the standard cartography problem. Finally, we aim to preserve the initial triangulation (to ensure fast rendering) without fold-overs or T-junctions. This adds a large number of additional constraints to the interior of each region that do not exist in the case of traditional continuous cartographs.</p><p>Instead, we use a multi-scale approach similar to the graph drawing techniques developed by Harel and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. Their method creates a graph layout by first coarsening a graph, solving the layout for the simplified graph and then progressively re-refiniing and re-optimizing the layout at each resolution level. As discussed in Section 4.3, our problem is particularly suited for such a multi-scale approach since our constraints as well as the mesh are by construction organized hierarchically. Furthermore, for each atomic step one can calculate the optimal position of a vertex making complicated energy minimizations unnecessary.</p><p>To represent a topological landscape we are using an adaptive 4-8 mesh <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. In particular, we chose SOAR <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, because its simplification metrics are compatible with persistence, its recursive refinement scheme implies a recursive method for translating the branch decomposition into a terrain, and its simplicity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">BACKGROUND</head><p>In this section we define contour trees, show how they are simplified, and discuss branch decompositions as one method of representing contour trees. For a more detailed discussion of the underlying theory we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>Let M be a manifold with boundary and f : M â†’ R a scalar function on M. One of the fundamental techniques to understand the behavior of f is to extract its isosurfaces, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Given an isovalue v the isosurface of f at v is defined as the pre-image of v on M:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">f âˆ’1 (v).</formula><p>The connected components of an isosurface are called contours. The contour tree of f is the graph obtained by continuously contracting every contour of f into a point, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>(a). Contour trees encode The branch decomposition is a multi-resolution representation of that same contour tree. It is obtained by selecting a root branch connecting maximum-minimum pair of the contour tree that maximizes a metric (here persistence). Branches connecting an extremum (degree one nodes) to a saddle (degree three and higher nodes) are added in an order based on some importance measure (here persistence). The further down a branch is located in the parent-child hierarchy, the less important its contribution to the topological description of the dataset is deemed. the evolution of contours as the isovalue is swept through the range of f . Bottom leaf nodes of the contour tree correspond to minima of f (where contours are created), internal nodes to saddles (where contours merge or split), and top leaves correspond to maxima (where contours disappear). Because of this relation between the contour tree and the global structure of the isosurfaces of f , contour trees have been used extensively in visualization.</p><p>The contour tree of a complicated and/or noisy function can become too large to be studied (or even displayed) directly <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. A contour tree is simplified by successively removing leaves and their corresponding branches, which is equivalent to a cancellation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> of the two critical points corresponding to the end points of the deleted branch. Another view is that a cancellation represents removing the mountain top (or filling in the valley) that the leaf symbolizes. To rank cancellations, different metrics are suitable. We choose persistence <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>-the absolute difference in function value spanned by a branch-since it corresponds to topological simplification. This correspondence is crucial in creating a landscape whose topology reflects that of a given contour tree.</p><p>We also use the sequence of simplifications to build a branch decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> of the contour tree, see 2(b). Each time a branch B0 attached to a branch B1 is canceled we say that B1 is a parent of B0 and B0 is a child of B1. This process provides us with a hierarchical representation of a contour tree that can be directly translated into a SOAR mesh hierarchy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">ALGORITHM</head><p>Given a scalar function f , we first extract its contour tree using any of the standard techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> and construct its branch decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Following the hierarchy of the branch decomposition, we recursively create a terrain with the same topological structure as f .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Terrain construction</head><p>Starting with the root, each branch is mapped to a region of the terrain, which is subsequently refined to provide space for all children of the branch. This process is applied recursively to each child branch resulting in the final terrain. Each branch creates either a peak (for a maximum) or a valley (for a minimum) surrounded by a ring of vertices at the function value of the saddle. The ring ensures that the saddles of the terrain have the same value as their corresponding saddles of f .</p><p>Initially, the root branch is modeled as a single peak, see <ref type="figure">Figure</ref> 3(a). The vertex at the center (marked red) represents the maximum and the ring of vertices comprising the boundary (marked blue) represents the minimum of the root branch. While one level of the SOAR hierarchy could be used to represent this peak, we use two levels to simplify the recursive construction. If the root branch has no children the terrain is complete. Otherwise, we refine the mesh to create sufficient space to fit the same 3-by-3 vertex configuration for each child. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3(b)</ref>, three additional refinement steps create sufficient space to place four children. However, regions share vertices (marked yellow) which interferes with assigning appropriate function values (see below). Therefore, we refine one more level, see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>(c) creating space for four isolated child branches. If more than four children must be placed, we further subdivide the mesh two levels at a time, quadrupling the number of available spots each time, see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>(d).</p><p>Assignment of child branches to the available spots depends on the function values of their nodes. Each branch (except for the root) connects an extremum to a saddle. We assign the function value of the extremum to the center vertex of the corresponding region and the function value of the saddle to the eight remaining vertices. This scheme automatically creates peaks for maxima and valleys for minima. Children are sorted according to the function value of their saddles and placed in decreasing order in a spiral layout, see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>(e). Finally, all vertices between children except the center and boundary of the parent are assigned the average function value of their neighbors. We apply this scheme recursively until all branches of the contour tree have been placed.</p><p>As children are refined, vertices may need to be added to their parent region to avoid T-junctions. We determine these additional vertices by temporarily considering a mesh uniformly subdivided to its highest resolution (as required to place recursively all branches of the hierarchy) and using the SOAR algorithm to determine the fewest number of vertices that must be added to create a consistent mesh. Note that for two neighboring child branches with the same saddle value special care must be taken to avoid under-refining the mesh. Conceptually, all new vertices are the result of an edge bi-section and we use linear interpolation along this edge to assign their function values.</p><p>This hierarchical construction scheme ensures that the isolines at the level of the parent-saddle enclose all isolines of its children. Therefore, the nesting structure of all isolines in the terrain is identical to that of f 's isosurfaces. Furthermore, the layout guarantees that there are no extraneous extrema since all vertices not specifically designed as critical points have at least one higher and one lower neighbor. It follows that there exist no extraneous saddles and the contour tree of the terrain is identical to that of f . The topological landscape not only preserves the topological structure of f but the function values are carefully chosen to also preserve the persistence of the features. Finally, by mapping the hierarchical branch decomposition directly to the SOAR hierarchy one can perform a correct topological simplification of the landscape by simply rendering a coarser mesh. As the center vertex of each branch is removed, the branch is rendered as a flat region at the height of the saddle. This corresponds to removing a mountain top or filling in a valley canceling the feature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Contour tree re-balancing for better space utilization</head><p>Using a recursive terrain construction scheme exposes a problem of the branch decomposition that is less obvious in graph-based representations, such as the toporrery. A branch decomposition often results in a very "deep" tree with many hierarchy levels. While some of these levels are a result of contour nesting properties, the use of symbolic perturbation and subsequent simplification based on persistence can contribute significantly to the depth of the hierarchy. To alleviate this problem we employ a recursive branch re-balancing step. Starting with one hierarchy level above the leaves we check if the saddle value of a child node is close to the saddle value of its parent branch. All  <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. Constructing a terrain from the branch decomposition compatible with the SOAR hierarchy. (a) The root branch is mapped to a SOAR hierarchy consisting of two levels with the maximum at the center and the minimum at the boundary of the terrain. The resulting mesh is refined further to create space for placing the children of the current branch. Adding three levels of refinement (b) adds sufficient space to place the extrema. However, locations for the saddles of a branch are ambiguous, as indicated by the yellow vertices shared between two children. Adding four levels of extra refinement (c) creates sufficient space for placing four child branches (highlighted gray in the image) and leaving a "buffer" zone between them. Furthermore, regions for placing the child branches are identical to the set-up for the initial branch. The vertex corresponding to the extremum (marked red/blue) is surrounded by eight vertices linked to the saddle (marked green). (d) Every two levels of extra refinement quadruple the number of available spots for children. (e) Children are placed in order of deceasing saddle value in a spiral layout.</p><p>(a) (b) <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. To achieve better space utilization in the recursive terrain generation scheme, we re-balance the branch decomposition. Child branches whose saddles are close (in function value) to that of its parent become its siblings. This reduces the depth of the hierarchy and in particular removes artifacts due to symbolic perturbation. The image shows the branch decomposition of the nucleon dataset in toporrery layout (a) and the re-balanced branch decomposition, where all branches with zero persistence are moved to their parent branch (b).</p><p>children whose saddle value is within a user-specified threshold become siblings of their parent (i.e., are moved up one hierarchy level). Subsequently, this process is continued for the next higher hierarchy levels until the root branch is reached. Potentially, a child branch can move up several levels in the hierarchy, if saddle values are very close. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> illustrates the effect of removing artifacts due to symbolic perturbation. All children with identical saddle values as their parent branch are moved up in the hierarchy. Clearly, the topological structure becomes much more obvious. While this approach is particularly useful for removing symbolic perturbation artifacts, higher re-balancing thresholds can be appropriate for some datasets. However, the resulting branch decomposition no longer reflects the exact nesting properties of contours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Metric-based distortion</head><p>The previous sections describe how to create a terrain whose topology reflects that of a given contour tree. Furthermore, the persistence metric is preserved by choosing appropriate height values. Nevertheless, there exists a perceptual problem, namely that the area (in the xy-plane) corresponding to a branch only depends on its level in the hierarchy. This can result in small patches with high persistence creating thin spikes in the terrain. Not only can such features be difficult to see, but they are traditionally associated with being noise or outliers. In this context, however, this association might be misleading as the hierarchy level, in general, is not necessarily related to the significance of a topological feature (especially when considering relative  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> and distributing volumes associated with the branches (c). Given a root branch (gray) the volume of its children is assigned to their respective patches (see Section4.1) and its own volume to the surrounding region. This scheme is followed recursively within each sub-tree. (c) Final terrain after adjusting areas according to the given volumes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>significance between branches on the same level).</head><p>To alleviate this problem and to further increase the expressive power of topological landscapes we treat the area assigned to a branch as an additional variable to be optimized. This allows us to preserve not only topology and persistence, but also another metric property chosen by the user. In our examples, we use the volume associated with a branch, as this is another well studied metric to decide the significance of a contour <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. As discussed above, each branch of a contour tree corresponds to a single contour being swept through the volume. Integrating the area of the contour through its life time results in the volume we associate with the corresponding contour tree branch. We approximate this volume by the number of vertices passed over by the contour. The volume is distributed to the terrain as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5(b)</ref>.</p><p>Each branch is assigned a square patch. Wihtin this patch, the volume of its children is assigned to their respective sub-patches and the volume of the root branch of this (sub-)tree to the triangles covering the remaining area. There are two important details for practical application: First, within a given patch the volume is distributed according to the initial area of each triangle. The original triangle area is tied into the valences of surrounding vertices and observing the local area ratios prevents problems in the later optimization. Second, instead of the original volume V we distribute V 2/n , where n is the dimension of the function domain. This compensates for the well known perceptual difference in judging relative areas compared to relative (hyper-)volumes.</p><p>Once the volume has been distributed, we create a standard quadmesh hierarchy in which leaf nodes correspond to triangles (or triangle-halves) and are assigned the corresponding volume. Internal nodes are assigned the sum of the volume of all their children, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6(a)</ref>. Subsequently, we iteratively adapt vertex positions (but not Let T L = (V, T ) be a topological landscape lvl = 1; stepSize = 0.25; epsilon = convergence threshold; while lvl &lt; MAXLEVEL(T L) delta = 2*epsilon; the connectivity) in a coarse-to-fine manner aiming to achieve area ratios corresponding to the given volumes. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref> shows the complete algorithm as pseudo-code using the nomenclature of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6(a)</ref>. In particular, we assume all vertices of the terrain to be assigned levels according to the SOAR hierarchy.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">while delta &gt; epsilon forall i in {0, 1} forall v in VERTICESONLEVELS(T L, {lvl + i}) optimal[v] = GETOPTIMALPOSITION(v); forall v in VERTICESONLEVELS(T L, {lvl + i}) v = STEPTOWARDS(optimal[v],stepSize); delta = MAXSTEPLENGTH(optimal); endwhile forall v in VERTICESONLEVELS(T L, {lvl + 2, lvl + 3}) v = AFFINEPROJECTION(v); lvl = lvl + 2; endwhile</formula><p>We adapt the mesh two hierarchy levels at a time considering only vertices of the current level or coarser. Each vertex independently computes its optimal position (see below), and then all vertices on a given level take a step towards their optimal position. Steps are constrained to maintain the current triangulation considering only vertices on their own level or above. Once optimization has converged for a given level, we lift the vertices of the next two finer levels to their appropriate affine position, placing them at the midpoints of the appropriate edges (given by the SOAR hierarchy). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6(a)-(d)</ref> show an example of an adaptive mesh being optimized by our algorithm. While we have no formal proof of convergence, the algorithm quickly converged in all our tests using a step size of 0.25.</p><p>To compute the optimal position of a vertex, we consider it as the center of four quad-tree cells, each with its target volume attached. There exist two cases: moving vertices on even or on odd levels as their connectivity differs, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>(e). In the following we derive the formula for odd levels following the nomenclature of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>(e). First, we re-scale the volumes corresponding to the four quadrants A0 âˆ’ A3 by the sum of their current areas to obtain the target areas t 0 âˆ’ t 3 we aim for. The area of, for example, the left upper quadrant can be calculated as.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">2 * area 0 = (p 1x âˆ’ x) * (p 0y âˆ’ y) âˆ’ (p 1y âˆ’ y) * (p 0x âˆ’ x) +(p 0x âˆ’ x) * (p 3y âˆ’ y) âˆ’ (p 0x âˆ’ x) * (p 3y âˆ’ y) = 2a 0 x + 2b 0 y + 2c 0 .</formula><p>With the corresponding calculations for the other three quadrants the squared area defect with respect to p 4 = (x, y) is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">areaDefect(x, y) 2 = 3 âˆ‘ i=0 (a i x + b i y + c i âˆ’ t i ) 2 .</formula><p>Finally, we solve for âˆ‡areaDefect(x, y) 2 = (0, 0) to find the optimal position of the center vertex. We found stepping toward the optimal solution to perform significantly better than the more traditional step in gradient direction. Two special cases exist: boundary vertices, and vertices for which p 1 , p 3 , p 5 , and/or p 7 do not exist. In the former case, optimization only considers those quadrants that are part of the mesh. In the later case, missing vertices are assumed to lie at the midpoint of their respective edges. Note that the optimal position of a boundary vertex always lies on the boundary as well. Therefore, optimization preserves the quadratic foot-print of the terrain. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5(c)</ref> shows the resulting terrain for the example dataset of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>Since we do not change connectivity, the optimized mesh can still be rendered using the SOAR algorithm. Nevertheless, for high quality rendering one must also guarantee that locally coarsening the mesh does not create inverted normals: Assume that an adaptively refined mesh contains a triangle with an inverted normal. Within this triangle consider the vertex on the highest SOAR level. The connectivity of this vertex is identical to that seen during its optimization. Since at the optimization stage triangles were explicitly maintained to preserve their orientation, this is a contradiction. If adaptive rendering is unimportant, we add an additional smoothing stage, aiming to improve triangle quality within each patch while maintaining patch boundaries.</p><p>We measure our error per branch as the difference in percent between final area and target area. The maximal error of a single branch in all examples is 8.8% for the engine dataset and the largest average error (error weighted by size of the area) is 1.4% for the hydrogen atom dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Discussion</head><p>The algorithm described above constructs a topological landscape for any given contour tree. We can illustrate any scalar function defined on a simply connected domain using this new metaphor. In particular, contour trees can be computed from n-dimensional functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, allowing us to illustrate topology of functions of arbitrary dimension. However, the main source of datasets with dimension larger than three are time-dependent fields, which require special treatment. While it is possible to treat a three-dimensional time-dependent function as being four-dimensional, current experience suggests that results are difficult to understand and that constructing a time series of three-dimensional fields is more advisable. Constructing animated landscapes to handle these cases will be one focus of future research. A limitation of our approach is that the topological landscape of a two-dimensional function (i.e. a terrain), in general, will look very different from the original. However, since terrain topology is readily apparent in standard renderings we find this to be a small limitation.</p><p>As with many non-linear and iterative optimization schemes the run time complexity is data and parameter dependent. Therefore, we cannot provide a formal bound on the overall complexity and using unfa- vorable parameters (e.g., an overly large step-size) the algorithm might not converge. Memory requirements depend hierarchy depth and corresponding SOAR mesh resolution. Currently, our implementation is not optimized and requires a temporary mesh of uniform resolution. We are working on an optimized implementation that eliminates this constraint.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">RESULTS</head><p>We have tested our technique on a set of classical datasets widely used by the visualization community. In general, we believe that the metaphor proposed here constitutes a good complement to classical techniques such as volume rendering or isocontouring. The topological landscape provides an overview of the structures present in the data showing their relationships in terms of function value, topological nesting, persistence, and amount of space occupied.</p><p>We stress that this concept is meant to be a complement to existing approaches since important properties, such as the distance between features, are obviously lost in the projection from the 3D volume to the terrain.</p><p>Below, we show a series of examples and comment on our perceptual experience with them. Naturally, this is just anecdotal evidence and by no means a substitute for a rigorous user study. For example, during development we arrived several times at the conclusion that a topological landscape was incorrect, probably due to an implementation error. Only after further exploration of the data we realized that our intuition regarding the overall structure of the dataset was inaccurate. The topological landscape was in fact correcting our misconception about the data. Overall, our initial practical experience has reinforced our belief that this new metaphor can be an effective addition to the general toolbox of scientific visualization components.</p><p>In all the examples below we have re-balanced the contour tree as described in the previous section to avoid nesting artifacts in the presentation and filtered low persistence topological noise. In all images we assign a different color to each hill and valley to visually separate features. The main mountain, not necessarily ranging from global minimum to global maximum, is presented in a semi-transparent gray to facilitate the visualization of deep valleys and its center is marked by a flag. In general, this metaphor has a bias in favor of maxima since the minima may be hidden at the bottom of a valley. In cases where this may be a problem, we provide a secondary view using the same main mountain but with nested hills and valleys flipped for visual inspection, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>. We note that this not the same as providing a completely inverted contour tree, but having an identical main mountain makes it easier to correlate information between two landscapes. For each dataset we report the average error that we commit when projecting the volume of a region onto the corresponding area in the topological landscape.</p><p>Our first example is the hydrogen atom dataset (data downloaded from http://www.volvis.org/). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref> shows the topological landscape together with a volume rendered image of the  data, assigning different transfer functions to separate topological features <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Notice how the landscape helps appreciate the fact that the two lobes in the hydrogen orbital (red, green) have larger function range than the toroidal ring in the middle (blue), although the ring takes a larger volume. One can also clearly see a large region at nearly zero persistence (yellow), which is probably an artifact from the construction process. In the past we completely missed this region due to its low function value even though it occupies a large portion of the volume. This is one case where we initially thought the landscape to be incorrect, while instead our standard exploration had simply missed this feature. A more important insight has been the size of the toroidal ring. From the 3D images it is not easy to realize that the ring becomes larger than the two lobes before merging with the rest of the volume. The explanation is that it merges from its interior and it is therefore difficult to capture this event using a 3D view. In the topological landscape we clearly see that the ring becomes larger than the two lobes before the actual merge event occurs.</p><p>The next example is the methane dataset shown again as topological landscape together with a volume rendering using a similar color scheme (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 9</ref>). In this case it is interesting to see how the landscape immediately clarifies, which feature is built around a minimum/maximum, something not evident from the volume rendering. In particular, the main feature related to the carbon atom is associated with a large minimum, while each hydrogen atom is associated with two maxima. Clearly, the combination of these two images, even without interactive exploration, provides a better explanation than either of them independently. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 10 and 11</ref> show similar illustrations for the engine and nucleon datasets. In both cases considerations similar to those for the hydrogen atom and methane data sets apply. The topological landscape immediately relates which regions are associated with maxima and minima and their persistence. Moreover, one understands better, which features take a large portion of the volume even though the 3D rendering does not contain that information explicitly due to occlusion.</p><p>The last three examples are the silicium <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 12</ref>), neghip <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 13</ref>) and fuel ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14)</ref> datasets. In these cases, we show topological landscapes together with a more traditional volume rendering using a global transfer function. This leads to a reduced correlation between the two visualizations and therefore hampers the benefit of the  simultaneous presentation. Nevertheless, one can derive information that would not be obvious otherwise. In the case of the silicium data set, for example, one notices that the structures forming the lattice of the crystal are a set of maxima and minima all of similar persistence and all occupying similar volumes. This is easy to see in the topological landscape and its flipped counterpart. The volume rendering complements this information with a sense of the geometric shape of the actual crystal. For the neghip dataset the topological landscape reveals that many features that are small in terms of volume but span a large function range. Their geometric distribution is highlighted by the volume rendering.</p><p>In general, we find that this new metaphor has the potential to greatly improve the effectiveness of classical visualizations, such as volume rendering or isocontouring, since it conveys complementary information increasing the ability of users to fully understand the inner structure of the data with much less exploration. Furthermore, we believe that this would be very effective in static illustrations where any information about the global structure of the data becomes extremely valuable. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We have introduced topological landscapes as a new metaphor to present topological information. Starting from a scalar function f we show how to project f to a terrain preserving the topological structure, function values, and persistence, as well as the volume associated with each feature. Furthermore, the landscape is encoded as a hierarchical mesh which can be efficiently rendered and whose hierarchy corresponds to the persistence based simplification of f . Overall, topological landscapes, though currently limited to scalar functions that have an associated contour tree, i.e., which are defined on a simply connected domain, provide a powerful new interface to complement existing techniques.</p><p>Going forward, we are experimenting with metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> beside the enclosed volume to further increase the flexibility of topological landscapes. Furthermore, we are investigating different layouts to reduce the amount of "empty" space and are considering changing the volume assignment within each branch to reflect the volume above/below its highest/lowest saddle in separate regions.</p><p>We further plan to explore linking multiple representations of a dataset, such as contour tree display, a topological landscape and a volume rendered image and/or an isosurface display. This combination should be very effective when exploring the structure of a dataset. Adding the ability to extract contour/height lines on a topological landscape, along with linking this contour with the corresponding isosurface of the volumetric dataset will facilitate the ability to detect higher level topological features.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1. The number of contours of an isosurface changes as the isovalue is swept thought the function range: After hitting a minimum, one contour is created (a). A new contour inside the existing contour is created around a second minimum. For a higher value, these two contours merge into a single contour (c). As the isovalues increases, this contour splits in two independent contours (d), which in turn both split (e), (f) until there are four contours. As the isovalue is further increased, these four contours are destroyed. We do not track genus changes that occur between split events, e.g., the hole forming in the upper component (d), (e).
