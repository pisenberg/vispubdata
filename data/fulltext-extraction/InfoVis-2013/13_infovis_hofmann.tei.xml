<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Abstract-Visualizations are great tools of communications-they summarize findings and quickly convey main messages to our audience. As designers of charts we have to make sure that information is shown with a minimum of distortion. We have to also consider illusions and other perceptual limitations of our audience. In this paper we discuss the effect and strength of the line width illusion, a Müller-Lyer type illusion, on designs related to displaying associations between categorical variables. Parallel sets and hammock plots are both affected by line width illusions. We introduce the common-angle plot as an alternative method for displaying categorical data in a manner that minimizes the effect from perceptual illusions. Results from user studies both highlight the need for addressing line-width illusions in displays and provide evidence that common angle charts successfully resolve this issue.</p><p>Index Terms-Linewidth illusion, data visualization, high-dimensional displays, parallel sets, hammock plots, Müller-Lyer illusion</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>A well-designed graph is a powerful tool that transcends barriers of language to communicate complex concepts from author to audience. Problems arise when readers are unable to easily extract a chart's main message or are led to wrong conclusions due to distortions. Distortions endanger the trust between readers and creators of charts. This trust is based on the premise that graphics have to be true to the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. There is a lot of discussion on keeping true to the data in the framework of (ab)using three dimensional effects in graphics. Tufte <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> goes as far as defining the lie-factor -the ratio of the size of an effect in the data compared to the size of an effect shown in the chart. Any large deviation of this factor from 1.0 indicates a misuse of graphical techniques. Computational tools help us ensure technical trueness -but this brings up the additional question of how we deal with situations that involve innate inability or trigger learned misperceptions. One example of distortions of this kind is the Müller-Lyer family of illusions, which include contextual illusions, such as differently perceived lengths of line segments depending on the orientation of arrow heads or the sine illusion as defined by Day and Stecher <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Regardless of the cause of distortion, it is the responsibility of the author of a chart to create visualizations that allow readers to extract an accurate interpretation of the underlying data. In order to gauge the extent of distortion due to perceptual limitations, we can employ user studies to provide empirical evidence supporting underlying cognitive models or to reveal previously unknown or not anticipated illusions. Parallel sets (parsets) as introduced by Kosara et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> are a graphical method for visualizing multivariate categorical data. Since their initial publication, parallel sets have spread to mass media outlets <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, have been implemented in various languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> and spurred further academic work [23, has 70 citations according to Google scholar]. While retaining the ability of parallel coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> to visualize a large number of dimensions simultaneously, parallel sets incorporate a frequency scale that is a wellknown feature of other categorical displays such as barcharts or mosaic plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</p><p>Parsets also allow the visualization of hierarchies <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. They share this ability with mosaicplots and their more general relatives, the treemaps, as introduced by Shneiderman <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and treemap variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref>.</p><p>All of these properties make parsets a powerful visualization in our toolkit, but unfortunately, the parallel set plot is a victim of distortion due to a contextual illusion: consider the parset plot of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>This plot shows the relationship between class status and survival on board the HMS Titanic (data assembled by <ref type="bibr">Dawson [9]</ref> from insurance and boarding documents ). The top bar in figure 2 shows the variable Class, recorded as either crew member or passenger in first, second, or third class. The bottom bar shows survival as yes and no. Lines are drawn between top and bottom bar -the (horizontal) width is proportional to the number of survivors and non-survivors they represent. A reasonable task based on this chart is to ask the reader to order class levels according to their number of survivors. However, when study participants were asked to perform this task, only 6.2% of all respondents selected the correct order, see table <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref>. No less than 37.5% of all participants agreed on one specific, incorrect ordering.</p><p>This phenomenon can be explained by the line width illusion. The  line-width illusion is a contextual illusion that leads to perceptual distortion in evaluating parallel sets plots. In this paper, we first describe and then quantify this illusion. We also propose and test common angle plots as an alternative method for visualizing multivariate categorical data that helps the audience to avoid the distortional effects of the line width illusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">LINE WIDTH ILLUSIONS</head><p>The phenomenon of the line width illusion is known and widely discussed in statistical graphics literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. It is due to our tendency to assess distance between curves as the minimal (orthogonal) distance rather than the vertical distance -see sketch 5 for a visual representation of both. On of the earliest examples of the line width illusion is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3</ref>. This chart displays the balance of trade between England and the East Indies as demonstrated by William Playfair in his Commercial and Political Atlas, 1786 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. One purpose of this chart is to highlight the difference between imports and exports in a particular year and the pattern of these differences over time. The difference in exports and imports is encoded as the vertical difference between the lines. When observers are asked to sketch out the difference between exports and imports <ref type="bibr">(Cleveland and McGill [7]</ref>), they very often miss the steep rise in the difference between the lines in the years between showing the balance of trade between England and the East Indies. In which years was the difference between imports and exports the highest? <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. Difference between exports and imports from England to and from the East Indies in the 18th century -the steep rise in the difference around 1760 comes as a surprise to many viewers of the raw data in figure 3.</p><p>about 1755 and 1765. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows the actual difference between imports and exports.</p><p>In the perception literature, this phenomenon is known as part of a group of geometrical optical misperceptions of a context-sensitive nature classified as Müller-Lyer illusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. Interestingly, there seems to be a general agreement that this illusion exists, but a quantification of it is curiously absent from literature.</p><p>The type of chart as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3</ref> proposed by Playfair is a quite common occurrence, particularly in election years -where these kind of charts are used to enable comparisons of support for different candidates. The recommendation from literature is to avoid charts in which the audience is asked to do visual subtractions, and show these differences directly <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Strength of the line width illusion</head><p>When visually evaluating lines of thickness greater than one, the line width illusion applies. As above, there is a strong preference of evaluating the width of lines orthogonal to their slopes as opposed to horizontally (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 5</ref>), which would lead us to a correct evaluation of parallel sets-style displays.</p><p>Orthogonal w o and horizontal w h line widths are related -the orthogonal line width depends on the angle (or, equivalently, the slope) of the line:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">w o = w h sin θ ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where θ is the angle of the line with respect to the horizontal. The perceived slope of a line depends on the aspect ratio of the corresponding plot -changing the height to width ratio of a display will change our perception of the corresponding line widths, if they are not adjusted for the slope <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. This finding is not new, but its strength on our perception is surprising, as can be seen in the example of figure 6. Again, survival and class membership on the Titanic is shown; the same parallel sets plot is shown twice in this figure, but with very different aspect ratios: in the plot on the left the number of surviving 3rd class passengers seems to be about twice as big as the number of survivors among crew members, whereas in the plot on the right the lines have about equal (orthogonal) width. The numbers underlying the figures are identical. Any perceived change is purely due to the different aspect ratios. For parallel sets-style displays, the audience has the area of the line segment as an alternate visual cue when evaluating frequencies. Because height (or width for a rotated display) of line segments is constant across the display, the width of a particular segment is proportional to its area. We could therefore employ area comparisons as a proxy or to augment line width evaluations. However, existing literature suggests that this method of comparison is particularly prone to errors in two scenarios commonly seen in parallel sets: (1) for extreme aspect ratios of the rectangular shape (Heer et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>) and (2) when comparing rectangles rotated relative to each other (Kong et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>). This incorrect perception and comparison of areas distorts the message readers discern from the graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Hammock Plots</head><p>Hammock plots, introduced by Schonlau <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, provide an alternative to parallel sets that is adjusted for the line width illusion. This is done by adjusting the horizontal line width by a factor of sin θ , as discussed in equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. This adjustment makes the perceived orthogonal line width proportional to the number of observations it represents. <ref type="figure">Figure  7</ref> shows an example of a hammock plot of the Titanic data. From top to bottom Class, Gender, Survival, and, again, Class are shown, capturing all two-way relationships of these variables.</p><p>The structure of a hammock plot is the same as that of a parallel sets plot; bars are divided according to class membership numbers, and lines connect categories between neighboring variables. Now orthogonal line widths represent the number of individuals in each combination. Additionally, the lines start from the middle of the bin and connect to the middle of the other variable's bins. This convention is in part due to the fact that the sum of horizontal widths (w h ) after adjustment is greater than the width of marginal bars.</p><p>The graph of figure 7 shows that barely any women were in the crew, while male crew members make up the second largest contingent overall (only male non-survivors are more frequent). One problem that arises when dealing with hammock plots, is that the adjustment of lines depends on the knowledge of the angle θ under which each line is drawn. This depends on the aspect ratio of the plot. Any changes to the aspect ratio, such as a non-proportional resizing of a figure results in a change of the angle and results in a re-introduction of the linewidth illusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Reverse linewidth illusion</head><p>A problem that arises in evaluating hammock plots is that if an observer focuses on horizontal line width the plots suffer from a reverse of the line width illusion: judging the number of survivors by class in figures 7 and 8 based on horizontal line width results in an ordering of (largest to smallest) Crew, 3rd, 1st, and 2nd -which is not the correct ordering: there were actually more survivors in the 1st class than in the 3rd class. Unfortunately, the problem of the reverse linewidth illusion is exacerbated in hammock plots due to their construction: the centering of lines around the middle of each level introduces a contextual coordinate system that encourages comparisons of horizontal line widths, which are due to the adjustment no longer proportional to the number of records they represent. The amount of the perceived distortion can be quantified by rearranging equation 1 as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">w h = w o csc θ ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where w o is proportional to observations and θ is again the angle of the line with respect to the horizontal. The idea behind the common angle plot is to construct a plot that is safe from both the line width illusion and its reverse, while keeping the basic structure of parallel sets plots and hammock plots. The line width illusion is triggered by differences in angles under which lines are drawn, so the basic idea is to draw all lines in a plot under the same angle. As this is not generally possible, a solution is to give up on the idea of straight lines between variable bars and think of ribbons instead, that are constructed from connecting line segments. We can then ensure that all of these ribbons have at least one line segment that is drawn under the same angle. Assuming horizontal bars for the variables, connecting bands between categories are drawn as a combination of a vertical segment, a segment under a pre-specified angle θ , followed by another vertical segment as sketched out in figure 9</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">A A A A B B B B ! ! 15°! ! 45°! ! 55°!= 65°F</formula><p>ig. 9. Sketch of ribbons under three different angles (from left to right). All ribbons form a connection between points A and B. The pre-specified angle θ (between the line and the horizontal band) is given as -at most-the angle of the longest connecting line between two categories of neighboring variables. This makes the width of ribbons comparable without being affected by the distortion, as all ribbons are sharing at least one segment under the same angle. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows a common angle plot of the same data as the hammock plot. Now, tasks such as ordering levels according to the numbers they represent are not affected by either line width illusion and 13 out of 18 participants in the survey gave a correct assessment of the number of survivors by class (more details to follow in the next section). We also see that a few more men survived than women, but proportionally the situation is very different -a much higher percentage of women survived than men. While more first class passengers survived than not, the survival chances of second class passengers tilt towards doom. More members of the third class and the crew perished than survived.</p><p>Common angle plots, as well as all of the related methods of hammock plots and parallel sets are implemented in the package ggparallel based on the ggplot2 (Wickham <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>) plotting framework in the software R 2.15.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The ggparallel package is freely available from CRAN (http://www.r-project.org/). The colors for the plots have been chosen using color schemes suggested by the ColorBrewer project (Harrower et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>), as implemented in the R package RColorBrewer (Neuwirth <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">USABILITY TESTING 4.1 Study Design</head><p>To determine the effectiveness of the common angle plot, we conducted a user study in the form of a survey asking participants to provide responses regarding the structure in two data sets with predominantly categorical variables. The Titanic data includes class, sex, age, and survival status for each person on board of the Titanic <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The gene data was retrieved from the UCSC Genome Browser (Kent et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>) and includes chromosome location for genes involved in one of three metabolism pathways: steroid biosynthesis, caffeine metabolism and drug metabolism. For each data set, participants were asked to provide responses for three tasks that analysts routinely perform as part of exploratory data analysis: Task I: simple comparison task, chosen to be unaffected by any illusion. Performance on this task should be comparable across designs.</p><p>Task II: simple ordering, involving three pairwise comparisons, some of which are affected by the line width illusion or its reverse.</p><p>Task III: more complex ordering task with at least six pairwise comparisons, some of which are affected by either illusion.</p><p>The study was conducted in form of a crossover design (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2)</ref>: each participant was presented with two out of the three display types, where the first display showed the Titanic data, and the second display showed the gene data set. All participants were asked to answer the same set of questions (see Appendix A) covering tasks I through III for each data set. This design allows for comparisons of display types and tasks while it is possible to simultaneously adjust for individuals' different skill sets and learning effects.</p><p>At the start of the survey, participants were given a link to a brief tutorial regarding the different plot types. Not all of the participants followed this link. The decision to not require participants to go through a thorough training beforehand was conscious. The main goal of our study was to assess performance of the plots based on intuitive evaluation. We therefore refrained from any coaching on how to evaluate plots in the training material and restricted ourselves to an explanation of the construction.</p><p>The choice to show only two of the three possible types of displays to a participant was made to encourage participation by reducing the amount of time needed for its completion. On average, participants needed 18 minutes to complete the survey. We did not find any significant differences between the amount of time needed between the first and the second block of questions (F 1,95 = 0.0556 for a pvalue of 0.8142), nor were there significant differences in the length of time taken between the three designs (F 2,94 = 0.1909 for a p-value of 0.8265).</p><p>No personally identifiable information was collected, nor did we offer any compensation for participation in the survey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results</head><p>We are investigating four aspects of the experiment in this section: (i) participants' performance on each task according to the percentage of correct responses, (ii) extent of variability due to subject-specific abilities, (iii) space of answers for the more complex ordering task III, and (iv) participants' preferences after completing tasks on two designs. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correctness of Answers</head><p>Answers for each survey question were recoded in binary form according to correctness (with 1 for correct answers, and 0 otherwise). This forms the basis for the evaluation of performance of the different designs. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> shows percentages of correct answers for each question under each design. Bold numbers indicate significantly different (worse) performance of a design compared to the common angle plot based on a generalized linear model with random effects to adjust for individuals' abilities. The model explains 77.4% of the total variability, corresponding to a highly significant statistic of 452.7 (p-value &lt;&lt; 0.0001).</p><p>The observed results match our expectations: task I does not show any significant differences between the designs and has overall the highest percentage of correctness reflecting its low difficulty level. Generally, the percentage of correct responses for a task decreases with an increase of its complexity.</p><p>Parallel sets were affected the most by the line width illusion and show significantly worse performance for tasks II and III in both the Titanic and the genes data.</p><p>Hammock plots led to significantly worse performance than common angle plots in the two questions that were affected by the reverse line width illusion, while they show equal performance as common angle plots for the other questions. For task II in the genes data, hammock plots have the overall best performance across designs-but this does not constitute a significant improvement over the performance of the common angle plot. Only for a sample size of over 150 participants would this difference be significant (for a power of 50% to detect this difference). The pathway-chromosome relationship is shown in a common angle plot in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 12</ref>. The top bar identifies chromosome location, the bottom pathways. Ribbon widths visualize the number of genes on a chromosome that are active in a particular pathway. Task III for the genes data asked for an ordering of the chromosomes involved in the pathway of steroid steroid. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> gives an overview of the performance of each design on all tasks.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> shows an overview of the predicted skill for each participant under the model. Skills are quite varied between -1.52 and 1.34, but a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test does not show significant deviation from a normal assumption (p-value 0.089). On the scale of the dependent variable the range in individuals' skills translates to a 17.5 = e 1.34−(−1.52) fold increase in the probability of answering a question on the survey correctly between participants with the best skill set and the worst. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evidence for line width illusions</head><p>Task III for the Titanic data required participants to order class levels according to the number of survivors, fewest to highest. There are 4! = 24 distinct orderings of the levels, corresponding to all permutations of length four. Some orderings are closer to one another than other orderings. The Cayley distance allows us to quantify this distance; the Cayley distance between two orderings is defined as the smallest number of switches necessary to get from one ordering to the other. Visually, this corresponds to a graph; each node represents one ordering, and two nodes are connected by an edge, if only a single switch is necessary to move from one ordering to the other, i.e. if the Cayley distance between these nodes is one. This results in a regular graph of degree six, where each node is connected to six other nodes. Between any two nodes, the Cayley distance on the graph is equivalent to the length of the shortest connecting path between the two nodes. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref> shows an overview of the permutation space together with an overview of the survey results.</p><p>The colored dots on top of the graph correspond to the responses from the survey. The size of these dots is proportional to the number of observers choosing this particular ordering. It becomes obvious from the three graphs in figure 14 that the answers to different designs occupy quite different regions, while answers based on the same design are quite close and usually separated by only one edge.</p><p>The correct ordering, as well as the orderings assuming the line width illusion and its reverse are marked by symbols. Answers for the common angle plot are centered around the correct answer, while responses to parallel sets cluster around the response corresponding to the line width illusion. Answers based on the hammock design are split evenly between the correct answer and the answer corresponding to the inverse line width illusion. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> gives an overview of all responses to task III for the Titanic data. Common angle plots show the best performance in terms of correctness (66.7% on 18 responses), compared to a correctness of 6.2% for the parallel sets plot on 16 responses, constituting a significantly better performance of the common angle plot at a level of &lt; 0.0001, based on a Mantel-Haenszel test (the difference in performance to the hammock plot is not significant with p-value of 0.1359, but the hammock plot performs also significantly better than parallel sets plot with a p-value of 0.0016 ). While the intuitive assessment of lines by their width orthogonal to their direction is well known, it is surprising to see its strength: in this particular setting, it is strong enough to 'shrink' the horizontally widest line for six out of 16 participants by at least 44%, from 212 to below 118, and a further three participants perceived a shrinkage to below 178, a distortion factor of at least 16%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Opinion on common angle plots</head><p>Answers to the question of 'which chart did you like better?' are shown in table 5. There is a clear endorsement in favor of common angle plots versus the other two types of displays. The most common reason cited for the choice was a facilitated comparison of width, area or "size", The only consistent complaint against common angle was a preference for straight lines. This purely aesthetic preference is deeply rooted and in our opinion the biggest challenge for common angle plots. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Methods</head><p>The survey was created using the Qualtrics Labs, Inc software (www.qualtrics.com). For survey contents, see Appendix A. The study design is presented in section 4.1. All models are fit in the lme4 package (Bates et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>) within the software framework of R 2.15.1.</p><p>Comparisons are adjusted for multiple testing using the multcomp package (Hothorn et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> )and evaluated for pairwise significances using the effects package (Fox <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>There is strong support from the user study that common angle plots help the reader to overcome issues arising from the line-width illusion and its reverse. This might come as a surprise, in particular, as common angle plots break one of the nice mathematical properties that parallel sets have: the area of a connecting line in parallel sets has a constant overall area independent of the angle under which it is drawn. Both hammock plots and common angle plots break this property. It does not seem, however, that the audience picks up on area as the main property of the displays. There are several other issues that common angle plots do not address in the visualization of categorical data, that should be noted at this point:</p><p>• Large number of levels in a variable introduces a lot of line crossings, which affects the overall effectiveness of the display. The number of line crossings is the same in parallel sets plots, but hammock plots reduce the number of crossings by centering all lines.  • The use of color to separate levels is also problematic for large number of categories in a variable, as it leads to palettes with very similar colors.</p><p>Apart from these problems that will have to be solved in a different framework of plots, there are several opportunities for extending common angle plots. One opportunity for extension lies in the algorithm to determine the thickness of the connecting line. In the tested version of common angle plots, the line width was not explicitly defined -the line width is a byproduct of specified θ for a band that connects marginal bars. Using an additional hammock adjustment as given in equation 1 in the slanted section of the line segment, we can keep the bandwidth constant, resulting in a common angle-hammock plot hybrid that bears further investigation. A drawback of this approach is that the sum of the bandwidths w h will no longer match the widths of the marginal bars, which might create an additional processing burden for the audience in mapping the relationship between band width and the width of marginal bars. Both hammock plots and this modification of common angle plots face the issue of band area as context to support reader interpretation of w o . Since the band area is now related to the incident angle θ , changes in the display aspect ratio may have a distortion effect. In the study described in this paper, this effect was not evaluated and aspect ratios were kept constant.</p><p>In the original paper (Kosara et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>), parallel sets were introduced to reflect a hierarchy of variables. Prior examples in this paper show sets of two-dimensional plots to focus on the association between pairs of variables. With color coding, it is possible to show hierarchies in all of the types of displays. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16</ref> shows a common angle plot with a hierarchy: survivors of the disaster are marked in blue, nonsurvivors by orange. From top to bottom of the plot a hierarchy is drawn, considering first survival, then gender, followed by age and finally class membership. The coloring tracks survival status throughout the hierarchy, the layout in a common angle plot makes comparisons valid across all levels. This is of particular importance in hierarchical displays, which by definition have a larger number of smaller groups than displays without a hierarchy exacerbating problems induced by the line width illusion.</p><p>Another opportunity for extending common angle plots is to add interactivity. It is important to note that any additions of functionality via interactivity should not come at the expense of developing distortion-free displays. In particular, a display with visual cues in conflict with (textual) interactive feedback introduces a higher cognitive load by asking the audience to make a decision between one of the sources of information (and disregard the other one as incorrect).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>We have proposed a new chart type for visualizing multivariate categorical data, common angle plots, and tested its usability compared to existing charts that perform a similar function. Results from user testing indicate that common angle plots effectively communicate underlying data without being affected by perceptual distortions due to the line width illusion or its reverse. Two other chart types which address visualization of multivariate categorical data: parallel sets and hammock plots, are subject to the line width illusions. Audiences perceive parallel sets with distortion due to a natural tendency to evaluate line width in the orthogonal direction while data is mapped to the horizontal width. For hammock plots a correction is made to map data to the orthogonal width, however the centering of the lines creates a strong contextual cue that encourages an evaluation of line widths using the horizontal measure, leading to a reverse line width illusion.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 16</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B PARTICIPANTS' DEMOGRAPHICS</head><p>All students, staff and faculty from Iowa State University programs in Statistics, Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and Human Computer Interaction were invited to participate by email. 93 individuals accessed the survey; 86 participants gave consent, 15 of those dropped out right after, 20 went to the training site and did not return. Out of the remaining 51 participants, 46 individuals submitted responses for all questions and five gave responses to the first block of questions. Participants used their own personal computing devices to access the survey, a majority of participants used Intel Mac OS X (versions ranging from 10.6.8 to 10.8.2), while Windows was the next most common operating system. The preferred choice of browser was Firefox, followed by Chrome. For two participants, the Qualtrics survey software was unable to capture operating system or browser information.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Who survived on the Titanic?
