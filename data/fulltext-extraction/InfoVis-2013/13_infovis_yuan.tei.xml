				<p>illustration of exploration enabled in our proposed Dimension Projection Tree/Matrix visualization of high dimensional data. Each node is consist of one data item plot and one dimension plot. Starting from an initial node (1), users can explore either in data item space (2, 3) or dimension space (4, 5, 6), by first selecting a subset of data items or dimensions, and then creating child nodes (3, 4, 5) or converting one single dimension project plot into a matrix representation (6).</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>High-dimensional data occurs frequently in science, engineering, and daily life. For example, DNA microarray technology can produce vast amounts of measurement data with millions of micrometer-scale probes. When analyzing text documents, the number of dimensions can equate to the size of a dictionary if a word-frequency vector is employed. As data are being accumulated at unprecedented speed, handling such data efficiently to provide insights to the users is critical for effective data analysis. Visualizing and understanding multidimensional data that is large in both size and dimensionality, is a major challenge in the research community.</p><p>Currently, one major category of techniques for high-dimensional data visualization uses dimension reduction. By converting the data to lower dimensions, which are easier to visualize, dimension reduction aids comprehensive and focused analysis. One problem with the current dimension reduction technology is that users have little con- trol over the process. In addition, after the dimension reduction, the original dimensionality information is lost. The intrinsic information on the relationship between the dimensions is no longer accessible to the end user. User interaction is not usually provided in such cases. Another group of visualization techniques, including parallel coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">34]</ref>, scatterplot matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>, and table lens <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>, avoids dimension reduction and visualizes the high-dimensional data at the expense of spatial resolution. Such techniques mostly deal with data with no more than twenty dimensions. Most of the current work on high-dimensional data visualization has focused on large datasets and reducing data clutter during visualization. Relatively few visualization systems can handle datasets with hundreds of dimensions, although these datasets are becoming increasingly common in many application areas, such as bio-informatics. A scalable visualization tool that allows the user to interactively visualize data with high dimensionality is critical for understanding the data.</p><p>Furthermore, the above mentioned techniques do not capitalize on the differences between dimensions. Indeed, not all dimensions are relevant for analysis in high-dimensional data. Irrelevant dimensions can make the discovery of interesting features, such as clusters, much more difficult by hiding them in noisy data. Even worse, in data with very high dimensions, data objects are nearly equidistant. In data mining, instead of examining the dataset as a whole, more recent research has employed subspace clustering algorithms to localize, search and uncover clusters that exist in multiple, possibly overlapping subspaces as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. In large datasets, on the other hand, interesting subspaces may only be discovered when appropriate set of data items are selected, as other data items may act as noise.</p><p>We suggest to support subspace exploration in a divide and conquer manner. The datasets can be divided or reduced into subsets of dimensions and/or data items, and those subsets can be organized in a hierarchical manner (tree). In this work, we develop a set of visual exploration methods and tools called Dimension Projection Matrix/Tree (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>), to visualize high-dimensional data and help users gain insights from both the data aspect and dimension aspect. In our work, a Dimension Projection Matrix (Figure 1 (6)) can be considered as an extension of a scatterplot matrix, where each row or column of the matrix represents a group of dimensions, and each cell illustrates a dimension projection (such as MDS) of the data with the corresponding dimensions. In the Dimension Projection Tree, every node is either a dimension projection plot or a Dimension Projection Matrix. Nodes are connected with curved links and each child node in the tree covers a subset of the parent node's dimensions or a subset of the parent node's data items. While the nodes of the Dimension Projection Tree visualize the subspaces of dimensions <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref> (5, 6)) or subsets of the data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1 (3)</ref>) under exploration, the matrix nodes further provide cross-comparison between different combinations of subspaces.</p><p>Both Dimension Projection Matrix and Dimension Project Tree can be constructed algorithmically through automation, or manually invoked through user interaction.</p><p>The user interface for Dimension Projection Matrix/Tree is designed to enable interactive operation and exploration in the dimension and data item hierarchy, such as drilling down to explore different levels of the data, merging or splitting the subspaces to adjust the matrix, and applying brushing to select data clusters ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1 (2, 4)</ref>). Our methods enable simultaneously exploring data correlation and dimension correlation for data with high dimensions. The interaction provided by our proposed methods allows users to effectively and efficiently explore large datasets containing hundreds of dimensions. Furthermore, our visualization methods enable simultaneous exploration on the data correlation and dimension correlation for data with high dimensionality.</p><p>To summarize, the proposed Dimension Projection Matrix/Tree has the following features:</p><p>• Improved scalability in terms of number of dimensions. The hierarchy enables users to explore high-dimensional data sets at different levels from the aspect of both data items and dimensions.</p><p>• Convenient means of exploration and manipulation of dimension subspaces. Users can operate on each plot of the Dimension Projection Matrix/Tree to explore corresponding dimension subspaces.</p><p>• Simultaneous exploration and manipulation of both data items and dimensions. By providing a visualization of both the data projection and the sub-dimensional space projection, users can interact directly with both data items and dimensions.</p><p>The reminder of the paper is organized as the follows. We start by summarizing related works. Then we present the design of the Dimension Projection Matrix/Tree, show details of the interactions, offer guidelines and then show some notable implementation details. After presenting our case studies and discussions, we conclude the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>In this section, we first show the limitations of general multidimensional data visualizations, when applied to data with large scale and high dimensionality. We then discuss the hierarchical (divide and conquer) visualization strategy. Finally we discuss a few existing techniques on subspace clustering analysis comparable to our work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Multi-dimensional Data Visualization</head><p>A few visualization techniques can simultaneously represent all variables of a multi-dimensional dataset.</p><p>The scatterplot matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref> visualizes the data projection in 2D subspaces spanned by all combinations with two dimensions. The parallel coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16]</ref> show data simultaneously on multiple dimensions via polyline metaphor. These two methods work well for correlation detection and data filtering, but suffer from the cluttering problem when handling large data or high dimensionality as one high dimensional data point has to be presented as many points or a polyline. Although researchers have tried to cope with the cluttering problem by navigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref> and feature extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9]</ref>, generally such methods do not scale well. Tablelens <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25]</ref> and Pixel-based visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref> are also useful techniques for multi-dimensional data visualization. They are scalable, however usually not good at showing data correlation and dimension correlation. One exception is the Value and Relation (VaR) display <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>, which can visualize dimension correlation. However it is not able to show data correlation at the same time.</p><p>Due to the complexity caused by the number of dimensions, highdimensional datasets are usually visualized after dimension reduction. Statistical methods to reduce the dimensionality can be categorized as linear projection methods (such as PCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>), and non-linear methods (such as MDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref>, SOM <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>). Multi-dimensional Scaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref> (MDS) projects high dimensional data points into a low dimensional space. An MDS algorithm starts with a matrix of item-to-item similarities and the output dimensionality (usually lower than the input). The location of each item in the output is assigned according to the similarities. In many visualization applications, a dimension projection method, such as MDS, projects data items into a two-dimensional plane, which can be displayed as a scatterplot.</p><p>In general, the dimension projection approaches are computationally expensive, despite of the techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">43]</ref> that reduce the computational load. These projection methods are usually scalable to data scale and dimensionality. The major limitation of them is that the individual dimensional information is lost, therefore the results are hard to explain. We use PCA and MDS projection in our implementation due to their good scalability. By allowing user exploration, the results are easier to explain.</p><p>Most dimensionality reduction methods focus predominantly on preserving one or a few significant structures in data. Often, the question of which structure to preserve is uncertain and task-dependent. To deal with this problem, grand tour <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">8]</ref> examines structure of high-dimensional data from all possible angles. Projection pursuit <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12]</ref> only shows the important aspects of high-dimensional space. Johansson et al.'s system <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> selects dimensions by quality metrics. Although many techniques above allow human intervention to select dimensions, the interventions are rather restricted. Our technique allows free dimension selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Hierarchical Visualization of Multi-dimensional Data</head><p>To handle large multi-dimensional datasets, the major challenge is to solve the clutter problem in terms of both dimensionality and amount of data items. A visualization that employs a hierarchical data structure together with a level of detail approach is promising. Such a hierarchy can be built in the data item space. Hierarchical parallel coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref> have been proposed as a multi-resolution view of large multi-dimensional data and are based on hierarchical clustering. Long and Linsen <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref> developed MultiClusterTree to interactively explore hierarchical clusters in multi-dimensional multi-variate data. Sifer <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref> designed a variety of user interfaces based on parallel coordinate trees to support the exploration of hierarchical multidimensional data. Slingsby et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> created the data item hierarchy by gradually partitioning the dataset dimension by dimension. They then explored the effects of a modified treemap layout to show the hierarchy. Piringer et al.'s hierarchical difference scatterplot <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref> explores the possible sub-dimension spaces, and explicitly visualizes differences between them. More recently, Elmqvist and Fekete <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref> systematically studied the hierarchical aggregation for visualization which can be applied to visualize multi-dimensional data.</p><p>There are also hierarchies in dimension space. Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref> proposed a radial, space-filling hierarchy visualization tool called Inter-Ring for visually navigating and manipulating hierarchical structures. The work is then integrated in Visual Hierarchical Dimension Reduction (VHDR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref> to explore high-dimensional datasets. Dimensions are first grouped into a hierarchy, and lower dimensional spaces are then constructed based on the clustering in the hierarchy, either manually or automatically, with the assistance of InterRing.</p><p>Our technique includes both data item hierarchy and dimension hierarchy. It therefore supports scalable exploration in both data space and dimension space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Sub-dimensional Space Analysis</head><p>High-dimensional data faces the "Curse of Dimensionality", which means that the data items tend to be equidistant. This adds significant difficulty to pattern detection. Furthermore, for most high-dimensional data, each pattern is prominent only in a few dimensions, while the other dimensions hide more features than they reveal. Recent research has introduced analysis in sub-dimension spaces.</p><p>Subspace clustering aims to detect clusters in subspaces. For each cluster, the data items as well as the relevant dimensions are calculated at the end of the algorithms. Müller et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref> have classified subspace clustering algorithms as cell-based approaches (e.g. CLIQUE <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>), density-based approaches (e.g. SUBCLU <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>) and clustering oriented approaches (e.g. PROCLUS <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>). They have evaluated a number of algorithms and provided an open-source interactive framework for the analysis. Parsons et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> conducted a review of common algorithms. Lex et al.'s method <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref> can be used to compare clustering results across subspaces. Tatu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref> proposed an interactive visualization designed for users to navigate through the subspaces, using the SURFING <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref> algorithm for subspace search.</p><p>Other measures have aimed to find the most important dimensions, and are used to study the dataset in the right subspace. For example, Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref> proposed DOSFA, in which they filtered out unimportant dimensions or dimensions similar to others. The above-mentioned work from Johansson and Johansson <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> also falls into this category.</p><p>All works above allow rather limited user intervention in the subspace analysis. In contrast, our technique supports free exploration of the subspaces. In this way, human knowledge can be better integrated into the exploration process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DESIGN OF DIMENSION PROJECTION MATRIX/TREE</head><p>Our proposed methods aim to discover clusters and interesting subspaces from high-dimensional data. High-dimensional data can be very complex; some interesting clusters can only be identified by selecting the correct subspace and some interesting subspaces can only be found by choosing the right subset of data items.</p><p>Our methods help users analyze high-dimensional data by creating, visualizing and exploring a hierarchy of subsets. In particular, we support simultaneous exploration of subspaces and subsets of data items with a hierarchy of Dimension Projection nodes. Each Dimension Projection node corresponds to a selection of the dataset, which is determined by a set of dimensions (subspace) and a set of data items. The nodes are organized in a hierarchical structure, whereby the dimensions and data items in the child nodes are subsets of the ones in their parents. The root node of the tree represents the whole dataset, with all dimensions and data items selected. During the process of investigation, a divide and conquer strategy is employed. Users always select a subset of either dimensions or data items, e.g. effectively reduce the either the number of dimensions or the size of the data. Users can create, modify and delete child nodes with a rich set of interactions. The interactions are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>, and will be detailed in this section.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Dimension Projection Matrix Nodes</head><p>Each of our Dimension Projection Matrix node has three major components: one dimension plot, one data item plot and one toolbar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Dimension Plot</head><p>The dimension plot, which is located on the right part of the Dimension Projection Matrix node <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 3</ref>), shows the correlations between dimensions. Each point in the dimension plot represents one dimension, whose position is given by a method of dimension projection.</p><p>In the plot, point colors can show the dimension-wise similarity. The color is decided by the following algorithm. After the mapping of points representing the dimension onto a 3D space with dimension projection, we assign a color for each dimension point by linearly transforming its three dimensional projected coordinates to the lab color space.</p><p>After this step, however, dimensions close to each other have very similar colors, which makes it very difficult to distinguish between different dimensions when a subset of similar dimensions are grouped together. To solve this problem, we reassigned the colors with the following method 1 . First a set of colors in the lab color space are sampled uniformly, before a K-means algorithm is performed with the original dimension colors as initial centers. Finally, the dimensions are assigned with colors from the new centers when the K-means algorithm converges. The result of this process is a set of distinguishable colors that corresponds to the proximity of dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Data Item Plot</head><p>The data item plot, located on the left part of each Dimension Projection Matrix node <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 3)</ref>, is a matrix of Dimension Projection plots. The design can be viewed as an adapted version of the scatterplot matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>, except that the rows and columns represent multiple dimensions and the scatterplots are based on Dimension Projection. The dimensions in this node can be split into k mutually excluding groups, G 1 to G k . Each dimension in this node is represented by one small color strip on dimension indicator, at the right and bottom boundaries. Position of a dimension on the dimension indicator shows its group belonging. Each cell of the matrix corresponds to a set of dimensions. Specifically, cell at i-th column and j-th row corresponds to the dimensions given by G i ∪ G j . Upper right cells display Dimension Projection of data items on the corresponding dimensions, while lower left cells display the Dimension Projection of the corresponding dimensions. Initially when a node is created, its data item plot is a 1 × 1 matrix. The user may later split the dimensions into k groups, resulting in k × k subplots. Each node in the upper right cell is a data item. The color of it is given by users' brushing.</p><p>1 The idea of K-means clustering in the lab colorspace is inspired from Mathieu Jacomy's "I want hue" project: http://tools.medialab.sciencespo.fr/iwanthue/theory.php</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Toolbar</head><p>The toolbar, which is located on the top of each node, contains several buttons, including "close", "move", "toggle dimension plot", "cluster data items", and "cluster dimensions". The latter two buttons are used to invoke automatic clustering algorithms to split the data items or dimensions and then create child nodes for each cluster. Next to the toolbar, N indicates the data item number in the data set, while D indicates the number of dimensions. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>, the dataset under exploration has 644 data items and 221 dimensions.</p><p>The following sections provide details about the interactions on nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Dimension Space Exploration</head><p>A suite of interactions is provided for dimension space exploration, including splitting/merging, zooming in/out and dragging. Together, these interactions allow users to efficiently explore the subspaces and find the ones with the most salient clusters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Splitting and Merging</head><p>Users are initially presented with only one node that covers all the dimensions in the dataset. This can be seen as a 1 × 1 Dimension Projection Matrix. However, interesting structures are usually hidden in the subspaces of the dataset. Users can split the dimensions manually or use some clustering algorithms. For manual splitting, users can select interested dimensions by either selecting them in the dimension indicators, or selecting them from the dimension plot with a lasso. After selecting the dimensions, users can drag them into the node to create a new dimension group, or into existing groups to merge them together. Users can also click the button on the toolbar, and run the clustering algorithms, which automatically splits the dimensions and the split new nodes are laid out automatically. By this way, a tree can be automatically constructed based with the predefined clustering methods. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref> is an example of splitting and merging dimensions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Zooming</head><p>Users seldom handle all the k 2 Dimension Projection plots simultaneously. Our methods allow users to zoom the cells in the matrix in order to change the span of the dimension groups. The size of the whole matrix is maintained so that the widening of one group would make the other groups smaller. This policy aims to make the most interesting dimension group the largest one, while keeping other interesting groups visible. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> illustrates the effects of zooming.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Dragging Out</head><p>Although zooming can provide a greater amount of detail about one subspace, other surrounding plots may still distract the users if they are not necessary. Therefore we allow the users to drag the dimensions to create a child node <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 7)</ref>. The child node is linked to its parent with several lines that correspond to the dimensions. With a hierarchical structure, the exploration history is recorded and visualized and users can easily trace the dimensions in a leaf node along its ancestors and see the effects of subspace selections; this helps users make sense of the whole analysis process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">Guidelines</head><p>Here we present some general guidelines for subspace exploration using our tool. The dimension plot is the main tool with which to gains insights into the subspaces, the most natural way to utilize it is to group the dimensions into several clusters, each of which represents a subspace in which the dimensions are correlated. It is a good idea to first split these clusters into a Dimension Projection matrix in order to gets insights into each cluster. Another potentially useful way is to select a few dimensions from each cluster to form a subspace, which helps reduce the number of dimensions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Data Item Space Exploration</head><p>For data item space exploration, users try to understand the data distribution, especially the potential clustering in each subspace. They can create child nodes for interesting subsets of data items, or label the data items via brushing. To create child nodes, users select a set of data items within one node by using mouse to specify the desirable region. The selected region is then computed with a highlighted bounding curve filled with grey background color. Users can then directly drag the selected data items out to create a new child node through mouse movement (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref>). The child node will contain these data items and all the dimensions of its parent node. Selecting a subset of data items will change the correlation of the dimensions, which means that some interesting dimension correlations can be found in the dimension plot of the child node. The user could then drag some dimensions out, and see the altered data item distribution.</p><p>Like traditional high-dimensional analysis tools, our approach support linked brushing. Users can choose a brush color and then select some points with a lasso tool; the points in other plots will also be highlighted, while points that are not selected will be faded during brushing. In addition, some datasets may come with data item labels, and the methods also support brushing points according to their labels. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Node Layout</head><p>An automatic method is designed for node layout. As the nodes are organized in a hierarchical manner, traditional tree layout algorithms can be applied. However, our deisgn contains two different kinds of child nodes: one that selects data items, the other that selects dimensions. The algorithm works in a recursive manner. First we put the root node on the top left corner, then place its child nodes of data items below it and the child nodes of dimensions on its right-hand side. Manual layout is also supported and users can move the nodes if needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS</head><p>Our interactive Dimension Projection Tree/Matrix can be implemented in many different ways. Our current implementation has a dataset server program and a visualization client program. The server part is written in Python and is responsible for loading the datasets, keeping track of data item and dimension selection, computing the Dimension Projection plots, and performing automatic clustering algorithms. The client program, which is written in C++ and Cocoa Frameworks, presents the visualization and handles user interactions. Communication between the server and the client is achieved through a custom protocol over TCP. Separating the computationally intensive tasks can minimize the CPU and memory usage of the client-side computer. It is also possible to implement the server on a cluster, making it possible to deal with large datasets. Our method uses classical Multidimensional Scaling (CMDS) to calculate the dimension projection. For dimensions, we set the distance function as one minus Pearson correlation coefficient. For data items, we set the distance function as Euclidean distance. As CMDS is equivalent to PCA when Euclidean distances are used (in terms of dimensionality reduction, PCA can be seen as a particular case of MDS) and, in our cases, the number of dimensions are generally less than the number of points. Therefore, in terms of implementation, PCA is used instead of CMDS. Our method does not limit the dimension projection algorithms; any algorithm that can reduce high-dimensional data to two-dimensional data, such as several kinds of MDS, Kernel PCA, and Isomap, can be used. In practice, the analyst can choose appropriate algorithms for the datasets under analysis.</p><p>We used spectrum clustering with kNN graph to perform automatic clustering of data items and dimensions. The distance function is identical to that used in the CMDS. Details about the spectrum clustering algorithm can be found in Luxburg's tutorial <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CASE STUDY</head><p>In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods with two real-world datasets. The case studies are done by the paper authors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">USDA Food Data</head><p>First we present a case-study on the USDA food composition dataset. This dataset is used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref> for their case study, here we demonstrate our prototype system with this dataset, and compare our results with theirs. The dataset is a collection of foods, each dimension represents a certain type of nutrient. After preprocessing, it contains 722 data items and 18 dimensions.</p><p>We loaded the preprocessed data into our system. In the main data item plot, we immediately see three clusters, and several groups in the dimension plot (see <ref type="figure">Figure 9 (a)</ref>). We brushed the three clusters with different colors to track them during exploration. In <ref type="figure">Figure 9 (b)</ref>, following the guidelines we discussed, we selected two clusters of dimensions and created child nodes for them. We found that the clustering feature changed. For example, the red cluster becomes concentrated under the left node. The blue and green clusters merged into one in the right node. In (c) we demonstrate the matrix representation. The dimensions are divided into four mutually exclusive groups according to the clustering feature of the dimension plot in (a). While observing the same information as in (b), we can also see the Dimension Projection plots of the combined subspaces. In (d) we selected the lower cluster and dragged it out as a new node, we found out that the dimensions Energy, Lipid and Water, became closer to each other in the dimension plot. Thus we grouped them together and separated them with the the remaining dimensions. In the resulting matrix, we found two different ways to cluster the selected set of data items. However, as shown in (e), in the original dataset, if we select the dimensions Energy, Lipid and Water, it is hardly possible to tell the three clusters directly, because other data items changed the clustering feature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">CADASTER Challenge Data</head><p>We also conducted a case study on a real world dataset from the CADASTER challenge [1]. The dataset contains the structural information of molecules. Each item in the dataset is a molecule, and each dimension is a SimulationsPlus descriptor, such as the number of atoms, the formal electric charge, or the largest principal moment of inertia. The challenge itself aims to predict the environmental toxicity (log(IGC50 −1 )) of molecules from these features. In our case study, we wanted to see how environmental toxicity is related to the dimensions and find a model of the dataset through visual analytics. However, the environmental toxicity is a continuous value, which means that the original problem of the challenge is a regression problem.</p><p>To make it simpler, we reduced the regression problem to a classification problem by trying only to identify whether the environmental toxicity is a positive number. There are 644 data items in the dataset. Excluding the environmental toxicity, there are 221 numeric dimensions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 10 (a)</ref> shows the original Dimension Projection plot of both data items and dimensions.</p><p>Because we already know the two classes (positive/non-positive environmental toxicity), we started by coloring the data items with two distinctive colors (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 10 (a)</ref>). From the original Dimension Projection plot, the two classes are mixed together, which makes it very difficult to discriminate them directly.</p><p>The dimensional space can be clustered into three general clusters; we selected the dimensions in the left part and created a new node for them (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 10</ref> (c)). It then became very clear from the data item plot, that the dataset can be grouped into three clusters, in this subspace. Having identified that most of the blue points are in the first cluster, we dragged this cluster out (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 10 (d)</ref>). We then examined the node in (d), split the dimensions into two groups using the clustering feature in the dimension plot. As shown in the Dimension Projection matrix, the bottom-right group appeared to be good for classification, so we dragged its dimensions out to create node (e). We repeated the process in node (e) and found a smaller subspace to discriminate the two classes. This subspace can be used to construct a classifier for the two classes. However, it is not sufficient to only take the dimensions; because we selected a subset of data items before we found the subspace, we must be able to make sure that a new point is in the subset before classifying it with the subspace. Accordingly, we went back to node (c) and tried to identify a smaller subspace that preserved the three clusters. The dimension plot gave us a strong hint to separate the dimensions; we created a child node (i) from the few remaining dimensions and found that it preserved the three clusters. After this step, we were able to perform the classification by first using the subspace in (i) to determine whether the point is in the first cluster, then using the subspace in (f) to separate the two classes.</p><p>The classifier we identified in this example is not very accurate, because we only did a rough exploration of the subspaces; for example, the second cluster in (c) also contains two classes and we have not explored yet in this case. However, the classifier we created through visual analytics can be a good starting point for automatic optimization algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DISCUSSION</head><p>This section summarizes our design and presents several limitations and possible extensions.</p><p>Our proposed visual analytic exploration tool called Dimension Projection Matrix/Tree helps users explore subspaces and subsets of high-dimensional data in a hierarchical way. The tool facilitates the investigation process by providing data item plots and dimension plots for investigating the subspaces and subsets, and interactive ways to construct the hierarchy, both manually and automatically. While the leaf nodes show the structure of a subset of the data, the whole tree depicts the global structure of the investigation process, which reflects the dataset.</p><p>There are very few existing works which support subspace exploration for high dimensional data. We compare our approach with the semi-automatical approach proposed by Tatu et. al <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref> in 2012. In their approach, SURFING method <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref> is used to find out possible subspaces for a given dataset. For example, in the USDA food data, 216 subspaces are found. In their approach, all subspaces are arranged according to clustering or ranking order. Therefore it is very difficult for the user to understand the relationship between different subspaces. In our approach the subspaces are organized as a tree.That is why the relationship between the subspaces can be clearly depicted by the tree structure, which is extremely helpful for the user to navigate and explore. The contexts of parent and child nodes can help the users to create a mental image to position the targeting subspaces or subsets in the overall high-dimensional data space.</p><p>Furthermore, our approach can provide the data subset exploration simultaneously, which is not supported by other methods. Of course, our methods can be further enhanced by the existing semi-automatical approach. Such an algorithm could be used to provide traces and hints for the users to select the next level of subspaces to explore.</p><p>Moreover, our design closely integrates the user into the exploration loop. When domain experts are the users, they could directly harness their expertise and domain knowledge to guide their exploration. We plan to conduct a user study with domain experts in the future to verify such a statement and seek a possibly better design of the knowledge integration.</p><p>There are several limitations in our current prototype implementation. Below we discuss them and provide possible ways to improve.</p><p>Correlation Representation. We used the most basic Pearson correlation coefficient to create the dimension plots. However, numerous interesting correlations are nonlinear, which means they cannot be effectively measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient. In addition, we did not cover correlations between multiple dimensions. From our case studies, we found that the main way to identify the interesting subspaces is to group correlated dimensions together, inspect the effect of grouping with the Dimension Projection Matrix, and then create child nodes for interesting groups. However, the fact that the dimensions are correlated to each other does not imply that the subspace is useful for a certain task, such as classification or clustering. To deal with such tasks, the dimension plot can be enhanced by providing more task-related information about each dimension; for example, the sizes of the points can be useful for representing the dimensions' relevance for classification, which can be measured by mutual information or other metrics. In this way, several variants of our design can be created to support different tasks.   (e) In addition, in the original dataset, when we select these dimensions (for example, Energy, Lipid, Water), it's not easy to tell the three clusters clearly.  Dimension Projection Algorithms and Performance. As our case studies have shown, we have applied our method on one dataset with 644 items and 221 dimensions. Currently, the data item plots are computed by PCA and the dimension plots are computed by MDS. There is no limit on which algorithm to use, so the main difficulty is to find suitable methods with which to compute the plots of data items and dimensions. There are many existing algorithms for doing this (see the related work section), each of which has different advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, analysts should find the best algorithm that can output meaningful plots of the dataset being analyzed, as well as keeping the response time acceptable. The performance and scalability is closely related to the dimension projection algorithm we choose. However, when there are numerous data items or dimensions, the rendering itself can take a long time; this issue can be solved by computing a density map with the appropriate resolution to replace the current scatterplot representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper has presented approaches called Dimension Projection Matrix/Tree for visualizing high-dimensional datasets. Our approach con-structed a tree of Dimension Projection nodes in which each node corresponds to a selection of the dataset. The selections are represented as a Dimension Projection Matrix with MDS projections of the data items on split dimensions. We have designed a flexible user interface for user interaction and exploration. Our tool allows users to explore complex datasets with both data item aspect and dimension aspect.</p><p>Our methods share the same aspect of grouping dimensions into a hierarchy as Yang et al.'s work on Visual Hierarchical Dimension Reduction (VHDR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref> for exploration of high-dimensional datasets. However, our design emphasizes investigating the data from the perspective of both data items and dimensions. Our approach is complementary to other high-dimensional data visualization methods.</p><p>In the future, we plan to integrate other techniques in highdimensional data visualization into our methods and may include advanced data analysis methods in statistics. Further investigation on the effectiveness of our approach also requires a formal user study.</p><p>the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.
