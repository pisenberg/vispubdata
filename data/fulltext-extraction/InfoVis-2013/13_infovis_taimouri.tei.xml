			<abstract>
				<p>Analysis of dynamic object deformations such as cardiac motion is of great importance, especially when there is a necessity to visualize and compare the deformation behavior across subjects. However, there is a lack of effective techniques for comparative visualization and assessment of a collection of motion data due to its 4-dimensional nature, i.e., timely varying threedimensional shapes. From the geometric point of view, the motion change can be considered as a function defined on the 2D manifold of the surface. This paper presents a novel classification and visualization method based on a medial surface shape space, in which two novel shape descriptors are defined, for discriminating normal and abnormal human heart deformations as well as localizing the abnormal motion regions. In our medial surface shape space, the geodesic distance connecting two points in the space measures the similarity between their corresponding medial surfaces, which can quantify the similarity and disparity of the 3D heart motions. Furthermore, the novel descriptors can effectively localize the inconsistently deforming myopathic regions on the left ventricle. An easy visualization of heart motion sequences on the projected space allows users to distinguish the deformation differences. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real imaging data show that this method can automatically classify the healthy and myopathic subjects and accurately detect myopathic regions on the left ventricle, which outperforms other conventional cardiac diagnostic methods.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Generally, analysis of dynamic three-dimensional object deformations such as cardiac motion, face expressions, and gestures is of great importance, especially when there is a necessity to visualize and compare the deformation behavior across subjects. Physical based approaches such as deformable models assume the deformation is governed by some physical principles, and estimate the deformation by minimizing an appropriate energy functional subject to deformation smoothness, which is achieved through finite element analysis. In geometric based approaches, a higher level of shape abstraction and information reduction is necessary to support efficient characterization of shape motions. In machine vision techniques, a shape descriptor extracts local/global geometric features from the shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42]</ref>, and then, an energy functional based on the shape descriptor is minimized to classify the shapes. The modern geometry introduces shape space, where coordinates of points in the space represent some generalized properties related to various geometrical structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</p><p>In information visualization, the motion typology was used to achieve a perceptual grouping effect on information analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, in which the users are more concern about how the data evolves. However, due to the large amount of spatial and temporal data, it is difficult for the human to perceive and interact with the information <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. Elmqvist et al. proposed a technique, called Growing Polygons, which provides a graphical representation such as colors, textures, and animation, for better understanding of the information flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Ji et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> combined the static and dynamic view selection methods so that the user can perceive the maximum amount of information from time-varying data. Moere <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> employed the information flocking concept to generate dynamic patterns in time-varying data based upon long-term as well as short-term temporal similarities. In this work, we analyze the shape variability of dynamic objects by encoding and compressing them in shape space. In other words, each group of shapes re-lates to the points in the shape space manifold, which is used to model the shape variability. The shape variability analysis can be used to capture the deformation of the dynamic objects and lower complexity of analyzing the deformations in a high dimensional Euclidean space.</p><p>One major area where the dynamic shape analysis and visualization can be immensely helpful is medical imaging analysis. Analysis of dynamic organs, such as cardiac motion, always requires high expertise in order to achieve accurate early clinical diagnosis. This paper aims at classification of normal and abnormal left ventricle (LV) deformations by statistical analysis of the LV variability in shape space. Cardiomyopathy is one of major cardiac disease, especially in children, which affects the myocardium such that the left ventricle cannot be filled as in a normal left ventricle <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. The traditional cardiac diagnosis methods are mainly based on general global volumetric measures such as left ventricular volume, left ventricular mass, ejection fraction, and cardiac output. However, certain local shape descriptors such as strain analysis, mean and Gaussian curvature, shape index, shape spectrum, and wall thickness can provide much richer information for the cardiac analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. As cardiomyopathy affects the wall thickness of the left ventricle such that in the myopathic regions, the wall thickness changes less than the healthy regions, we can compare the wall motion and its thickness change to visualize, classify and localize the myopathic regions on the left ventricle.</p><p>In this paper, we embed a sequence of poses, i.e., shapes, of the left ventricle motion during one heart cycle as the points on the shape space manifold, and define the similarity between each pair of poses by measuring the geodesic distance between their corresponding points on the shape space manifold. Therefore, each deformation can be represented by a high-dimensional curve on the non-linear shape space manifold, and the deformation classification problem is converted to the high-dimensional curve classification problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Related Work</head><p>In many cardiac analysis approaches, Wall Thickness (WT) is used as a sensitive indicator of abnormal cardiac contraction and expansion <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. WT is mainly computed by drawing line segments perpendicular to the centerline of the endocardial and epicardial contours at each slice <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. As a 3D extension of this method, the center-surface model provides a viable framework to describe shape parameters such as WT and bending which do not belong to the linear Euclidean space <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. Therefore, the linear shape analysis techniques do not apply to these parameters. The medial surface of a 3D object consists of the centers of all spheres that are interior to the object and tangent to the object's boundary at two or more points.</p><p>Medial representation (m-Reps) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> and continuous medial representations (cm-Reps) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref> are deformable parametric representations of the boundary-medial relationship, which are deformed to fit the interiors of objects to the model structure. Terriberry et al. presented a 3D medial surface based on subdivision surfaces, which is parameterized over a fixed domain and can support the complex medial surface with more than one medial surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. Sun et al. applied the medial model to the right and left ventricle deformations and concluded that the medial model can capture the deformation of the left and right ventricles along with the changes of their wall thickness over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>.</p><p>Fletcher et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> presented principal geodesic analysis (PGA) as a generalization of principal component analysis (PCA) to compute the variability of data on a manifold. The method considers the intrinsic properties of the manifold such as geodesic curves and distance for calculation of shape variability. They used Riemannian log map to project the points of the non-linear shape space manifold onto the linear tangent space, which is distance preserving map, whereas the orthogonal map is not <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. They tested PGA by computing the shape variability on a hippocampus data set. In addition, the points on the tangent space can be projected back to the shape space manifold using the Riemannian exponential map.</p><p>This paper aims to differentiate motions across subjects, in particular, the healthy and myopathic left ventricles based on the changes of the LV wall thickness. Towards this end, a non-linear shape space framework based on m-Reps is introduced, which can capture the characteristics of the LV deformation, using two new shape descriptors. Consequently, the log map can be employed to project the non-linear space onto a linear one and measure the similarity between different medial surface deformations. Our contributions in this paper can be summarized as follows,</p><p>• A new shape space based on the medial surface and thickness function is introduced, where the geodesic distance between two embedding points measures the similarity of the corresponding deforming shapes;</p><p>• Two novel shape descriptors are defined in the shape space, which can discriminate different deformations and detect their differences;</p><p>• The effectiveness of the medial surface shape space is demonstrated for visualization and classification of the left ventricle deformations.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The shape space theoretical background is reviewed in Section 2; the medial surface shape space and the classification framework are introduced in Section 3; the experimental results on the synthetic and real left ventricle datasets are illustrated in Section 4 and Section 5, followed by Conclusions in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">SHAPE SPACE THEORY</head><p>Let X be a topological space and ∼ be an equivalence relation. The equivalence class of y is defined as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">[y] = {x ∈ X|y ∼ x} .</formula><p>The set of all equivalence classes in X w.r.t. to ∼ is called quotient space of X by ∼, i.e. X/ ∼= {[x] : x ∈ X}. Each equivalence class has a projection map π which maps each element of X to its equivalence class,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">π : X → X/ ∼, [x] = π (x) .</formula><p>Assume a high dimensional space N in which each point characterizes one shape, e.g., the space all immersions of a fixed connectivity in which each point is a vector in R 3 and contains the coordinates of k landmarks, k-ad, selected from the shape. One can determine the equivalence class of each point on this space, that is, the set of points in this space which can be mapped to each other by a certain transformation G. This yields a non-linear Riemannian space M, shape space, which is the quotient space of the space N by the action of the transformation G, i.e. M = N/G. For example, the centered and scaled shapes in the k-ad space construct a preshape space S km in which the points can be mapped to each other by the orthogonal group SO(m), i.e. rotation. Thus, shape space is a quotient space, that's, σ km = S km /SO(m) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>In general, the choice of transformation depends on the geometric property to which the shapes are invariant. The invariance properties can be integrated either into shape space design such that the shape representation is independent of some properties, or into metrics which do not consider certain transformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In this paper, we pursue the first approach by introducing two shape descriptors which can capture the geometrical differences between healthy and myopathic left ventricle deformations. Our shape space is constructed and equipped with a novel metric in order to measure the distance, therefore, facilitating statistical analysis in shape space to model the shape variability during given deformations. We compare shape deformations by modeling the variability of the intermediate poses over the course of deformation, and compare the spread of these populations in shape space. In general, the means and variations (extrinsic or intrinsic) are adequate for classification in most practical problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. As shape space is a non-linear space, the linear statistical analysis does not induce welldefined shape variabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>. However, we can employ the Exp and Log maps to project each point from non-linear shape space onto linear tangent plane, and estimate the variability on a tangent space as in the Euclidean space using Exponential maps. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Cardiomyopathy</head><p>This work aims to classify the normal and abnormal left ventricle (LV) deformations based on the changes in the Wall Thickening (WT) of LV. Cardiomyopathy is the main cardiac disease which affects the wall thickness and its functionality, and is a well-known cause of heart failure or sudden cardiac death in children <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. In this disease, the normal alignment of muscle cells is disrupted, which obstructs the outflow of blood from the left ventricle. There are three types of Cardiomyopathy <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2</ref>):</p><p>• Dilated CardioMyopathy (DCM): A portion of the myocardium is dilated, often without any obvious cause. In this condition, the heart becomes weakened and enlarged and cannot pump blood efficiently <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>• Hypertrophic CardioMyopathy (HCM): A portion of the myocardium thickened without any obvious cause <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</p><p>• Restrictive CardioMyopathy (RCM): The walls are rigid, and the heart is restricted from stretching and filling with blood properly <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>.</p><p>In prior research work, the WT is usually computed from the centerline method. In this work, the medial surface is computed, and its features are extracted during one heart cycle for each kind of cardiomyopathy. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Medial Representation</head><p>In the medial representation framework, the medial surface (M) consists of some atoms. Each atom (m) contains the center of an inscribed sphere (x), the sphere radius (r), and two or three vectors, called spokes (Si), from the sphere centers to the two or three tangent points on the boundary points y i <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3</ref>), i.e., m = {x, r, S1, S2} ∈ M. The atoms can be considered as control points on a continuous medial surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. An end atom is an atom with three spokes located on the boundary of the medial surface. To simplify the calculations, we do not consider the end atoms in this work. Let r(t1) and r(t2) be the radius elements of an atom m at two sequential time points t1 and t2, respectively. We can estimate the changes of WT at atom m as r(t2)/r(t1), called Proportion of Thick- ness (P T ). Since cardiomyopathy affects the myocardium such that the left ventricle cannot contract or expand normally during systolic and diastolic periods of one heart cycle, the changes of wall thickness in myopathic areas are not as healthy areas. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> illustrates the mean and standard deviation of the P T values of the atoms in myopathic and healthy regions of all the subjects. Our observations confirms that P T values of atoms in myopathic regions are close to 1 during one heart cycle, which shows these regions cannot contract or expand as the atoms in healthy subjects whose P T values are &lt; 1 in diastole and &gt; 1 in systole. This makes P T a good candidate to differentiate healthy and myopathic LV's, and localize myopathic regions. However, due to the existence of noise in the acquired images, as well as the lack of accuracy in the extracted medial surface, PT values of some atoms in healthy subjects might also be close to one, which lowers the accuracy of PT as a reliable measure. To tackle this problem, two additional measures are introduced, which can correct and enhance the accuracy of PT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Average of Normal vectors (AoN)</head><p>During one heart cycle, the medial surface and wall thickness change according to the left ventricle contraction and expansion. However, in myopathic subjects, one portion of the left ventricle cannot deform consistent with other parts, which in turn affects medial surface and wall thickness. LetM be the set of all atoms whose PT ≈ 1, N be normal vector of each atom inM, and N avg be the Average of these Normal vectors (AoN). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref>.a shows the medial surface of a myopathic LV at three sequential time points along with the normal vectors of atoms inM. Since the atoms of a myopathic region construct a patch-shape on LV, the direction of AoN does not change noticeably during one heart cycle ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4.c)</ref>.</p><p>As aforementioned, some atoms of a healthy LV might belong tô M, i.e., PT ≈ 1, but since there is no myopathic region on a healthy LV, theM atoms in a healthy LV are distributed all over the medial surface and this distribution might change during one heart cycle at sequential time points <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 4.b)</ref>. As a result, the direction of AoN changes considerably during one heart cycle, and also during different cycles ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4.d</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Mean of Centers (MoC)</head><p>Let x be the center of each atom inM andx be the Mean of the Centers (MoC). In a myopathic LV, theM atoms are concentrated around the myopathic region, thus MoC is close to the medial surface during one heart cycle ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5.a)</ref>. In contrast, theM atoms distributed all over the medial surface in a healthy LV, and the corresponding MoC is located inside the medial surface at different time points <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 5.b)</ref>. Therefore, we can easily calculate MoC of atoms inM and compare its closeness to the medial surface in different subjects to determine abnormalities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">The Medial Surface Shape Space</head><p>In order to quantify and measure the similarity of the LV deformations reflected byM, we embed the deforming shapes into a medial surface shape space, where each point corresponds to a certain LV medial surface rather than one atom. Let L be the medial surface shape space manifold and l ∈ L be a point corresponding to one medial surface. Based on the shape descriptors and characteristics described before,  we can define the unique shape space as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">l = (x,r ρ , N avg ) ∈ { R 3 × R + × S 2 } ,</formula><p>wherex and N avg are the MoC and AoN ofM of l,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">r = ∏ i∈M ( ri(t2) ri(t1) ) ,</formula><p>is the multiplication of PT values over all atoms inM, and ρ is a constant measuring the average of the log map distance between the normal vector N and the corresponding spoke vector S at all the atoms in M. Basically, the introduced shape descriptor uses the normal vectors of the medial surface to confirm the accuracy of PT values in different subjects. However, the medial surface as mentioned before contains spokes which are the normal vectors of the boundary, not of the medial surface <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6</ref>). To take this difference into account, the distance between each spoke and the corresponding normal vector is measured by the log map as in Eq.2,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">LogN(S) = ( s1 • θ sin(θ) , s2 • θ sin(θ) ) ,</formula><p>where N is the normal vector of the medial surface, and S = <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(s1, s2, s3)</ref> is the spoke. The average of log map distance between In the following, we prove that the introduced left ventricle medial surface space L is a diffeomorphic to the quotient space. Let L = { R 3 × R + × S 2 } be the symmetric space of the medial surfaces, and the group G = {</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">R 3 × R + × SO(3) } act on it smoothly as, G × L → L : g • l = (v, s, R) • (x, r, S) = (x + t, r • s, R • S) .</formula><p>where t is the translation, s is the scaling factor, and R is the rotation matrix. R 3 is a Lie group under vector addition, R + is an element <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>.

Therefore, G as a product of three Lie groups is also a Lie group <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON SYNTHETIC DATA</head><p>Some genus zero surfaces with one boundary are generated to simulate the LV medial surface and the wall thickness is simulated as a function on the surfaces. Then, the surfaces and their thickness functions are changed in accordance with the LV deformation. As the point correspondences are known, there is no need for the surface registration. The end atoms located on the boundary cause instability in the analysis, thus we avoid such instability by removing all the end atoms. After calculation of AoN and MoC values, the location of each intermediate pose is determined in shape space; and then, the intrinsic variance of the corresponding points of each deformation is computed accordingly. The synthetic datasets simulating myopathic LV's show noticeably less variances than the other datasets. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Noise Resistance</head><p>Due to inaccuracy in the medial surface extraction and also due to existence of noise in the acquired images, the medial surface may not be extract accurately. To evaluate the performance of the method against these inaccuracies, some uniform and Gaussian noises are added to the medial surface at the first step. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows the percentage of misclassified deformations with different noise distributions. The performance is robust to the additive noise. Furthermore, the inaccuracy in the extracted medial surface incurs the inaccurate wall thickness. Thus, some noises are added to the 2D thickness function under the condition that the error does not overwhelm the motion characteristics. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, this method is also resistance against inaccurate wall thickness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Myopathic Region Size</head><p>Measuring the myopathic region size can reveal the severity of the disease. Towards this end, some 2D functions simulating different sizes of the myopathic regions are generated as the thickness functions along with some additive noises <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 7)</ref>. As the myopathic region size can reveal the severity of the disease, some 2D functions simulating different sizes of the myopathic regions were generated as the thickness functions, and contaminated with some additive noises. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> illustrates the mean and standard deviation of the spherical log map distance between AoN vectors at different time points in each dataset, and the normalized distance between MoC and the center of the medial surface, i.e. the average of all the atoms in the medial surface, in all the datasets with various myopathic region sizes. The experiments reveal that as the myopathic region grows, its MoC moves towards inside the medial surface, yet its AoN vectors at different time points are still coherent. On the contrary, as the myopathic region becomes smaller, its AoN vectors become more diverged, yet its MoC is still on the medial surface. This means that the method is capable to detect myopathic regions of different sizes. Especially, the capability of detecting tiny myopathic regions can lead to the early diagnosis.  The CT and gated images of the left ventricle during one heart cycle were acquired from 19 control subjects and 25 myopathic subjects whose cardiac abnormalities were verified by cardiologists. Each dataset contains eight time points during one heart cycle. First, the medial surfaces of sequential poses were extracted with 400 atoms at each pose using the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> as follows,</p><p>1.

Furthermore, we can use multiple templates and fuse the results of segmentation using the majority voting or STAPLE <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref> methods in order to achieve more accurate medial surface. Finally, the location of each pose embedded in the medial surface shape space is calculated along with the intrinsic variance for each subject <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 8</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 10</ref> shows the automatic classification pipeline along with the automatic processing steps. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> illustrates the sensitivity and specificity of our method using σ 2 = 0.1.

As seen, σ 2 = 0.1 can split two healthy and myopathic groups. The method outperforms other methods based on the LV cavity, mean radial displacement and mean radial velocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>. In fact, this indicator is very sensitive in detecting myopathic regions.</p><p>To better visualize dis/similarity of the deformations, the corresponding medial surface points on the shape space manifold are projected on a 2D plane using the MultiDimensional Scaling method (MDS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and based on the proposed metric.

We minimize the difference between pair-wise distances in the medial surface shape space, e.g. d(li, lj), and the distance between their corresponding points on the 2D space, e.g. ∥xi − xj∥, that's, </p><formula xml:id="formula_25">∑ i&lt;j (∥xi − xj∥ − di,j) 2<label>(9)</label></formula><p>For clear illustration, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 11</ref> only shows the points corresponding to two randomly selected myopathic subjects and two randomly selected healthy subjects after projection on the 2D plane. In the myopathic subjects, since MoC's and AoN's do not change in sequential poses, their corresponding embedded points are located close to each other on the shape space manifold, so are their corresponding points on the 2D plane after the MDS projection as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 11</ref>. Our prototype comparative visualization and classification system allows domain users to select any of the point in the projected shape space to identify a corresponding pose of the left ventricle of the human subject. For a cardiomyopathic human subject, the myopathic region can be automatically localized and visualized. The system is a stone alone program. The input data was the standard format of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) which is a standard for storing and transmitting information in medical imaging. After segmentation and normalization of the left ventricle, the medial surface was extracted, and the suspicious myopathic areas were calculated using our approach and marked on the 3D left ventricle surface using VTK(Visualization Toolkit) libraries. Three junior and two senior cardiologists from our institution have evaluated our system, each tested 4 ∼ 5 normal and 5 abnormal subjects. After loading the DICOM images, the cardiologists navigate through the DICOM slices and visually inspect the wall thickness in the left ventricle which usually take 10 ∼ 20min for each subject, and investigate the location of myopathic region, and then, compare it with our results for efficacy test. The prototype system has been commended by all five cardiologists, who have tested it, for its ease of use, accuracy of classification and clear visualization in the diagnosis of cardiomyopathy.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This paper has presented a novel comparative visualization and classification method based on medial surface shape space, which can quantify shape motions and localize the inconsistently deforming regions across subjects. In order to determine the similarity between two medial representations, we introduce a new metric which measures the geodesic distance between two points corresponding to two medial representations on the shape space manifold. This metric reconciles to the non-linearity of the shape motion path on shape space.</p><p>We have applied to the classification and comparison of the left ventricle motions. In particular, we have employed PT values of each LV to detect the candidate myopathic locations. To improve the performance of the PT values, two additional novel shape descriptors, AoN and MoC, are introduced to capture the non-linearity of the LV deformation for diagnosis of the cardiomyopathy disease. Our experiments have shown that it is of great use to diagnose the myopathic left ventricles in which myopathic regions do not work normally and the wall thickness during heart motion is affected accordingly. The experimental results show that this method can automatically classify the healthy and myopathic subjects as well as detect myopathic regions on the left ventricle well. This method shows remarkable sensitivity and specificity, which outperforms other conventional cardiac diagnostic methods.</p><p>The choice of number atoms to capture the deformation of the left ventricle might lead to incorrect sampling. Sun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> employ around 200 atoms, whereas we use 400 atoms for the medial surface extraction which has more sensitivity. However, we can use a multiresolution framework to extract a low-resolution medial surface in the coarsest resolution, increase the sampling in the areas which are more likely to be myopathic, i.e. the areas with PT values close to 1, and then, investigate their spatial distribution from coarsest to finest resolution. This issue will be investigated further in the future work.   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 11</ref>. The projection of two healthy and two myopathic LV motions (each containing 8 motion snapshots) onto the 2D plane illustrates that the points corresponding to the healthy LV are scattered all over the 2D plane, but those of the myopathic LV are concentrated on the same part of the 2D plane.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Let</head><label></label><figDesc>M be a complete Riemannian manifold. According to Corollary 1, there exists a geodesic between each pair of points on M. Let v ∈ TpM be a tangent vector, thus there exists a unique geodesic γv(t), where γv(0) = p and γ ′ v (0) = v. The exponential map Expp(v) : TpM → γv(t) maps the vector v to a point on the geodesic γv(t). The exponential map preserves the distance from the initial point p, i.e., d(p, Expp(v)) = ∥v∥. Its inverse on the Riemannian manifold is called Log map, Logx. Let p, q ∈ M be two points in a neighborhood on M, then the geodesic between p and q is d(p, q) = ∥Logp(q)∥.</figDesc></figure>
