			<abstract>
				<p>Scatterplot matrices (SPLOMs), parallel coordinates, and glyphs can all be used to visualize the multiple continuous variables (i.e., dependent variables or measures) in multidimensional multivariate data. However, these techniques are not well suited to visualizing many categorical variables (i.e., independent variables or dimensions). To visualize multiple categorical variables, &quot;hierarchical axes&quot; that &quot;stack dimensions&quot; have been used in systems like Polaris and Tableau. However, this approach does not scale well beyond a small number of categorical variables. Emerson et al. [8] extend the matrix paradigm of the SPLOM to simultaneously visualize several categorical and continuous variables, displaying many kinds of charts in the matrix depending on the kinds of variables involved. We propose a variant of their technique, called the Generalized Plot Matrix (GPLOM). The GPLOM restricts Emerson et al.&apos;s technique to only three kinds of charts (scatterplots for pairs of continuous variables, heatmaps for pairs of categorical variables, and barcharts for pairings of categorical and continuous variable), in an effort to make it easier to understand. At the same time, the GPLOM extends Emerson et al.&apos;s work by demonstrating interactive techniques suited to the matrix of charts. We discuss the visual design and interactive features of our GPLOM prototype, including a textual search feature allowing users to quickly locate values or variables by name. We also present a user study that compared performance with Tableau and our GPLOM prototype, that found that GPLOM is significantly faster in certain cases, and not significantly slower in other cases.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Many datasets are stored in tabular form, with one row for each tuple, and one column for each attribute. If the attributes are dependent variables (e.g., dependent variables of a key or row id), we speak of multivariate data, for which many techniques exist for visualizing several variables at once, such as scatterplot matrices (SPLOMs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, parallel coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and glyphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Some of the columns, however, may be best thought of as independent variables, in which case we speak of multidimensional multivariate (mdmv) data <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Stolte et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> use the term dimension for a (categorical or ordinal) independent variable, and measure for a dependent variable. We will refer to dimensions as categorical variables, and measures as continuous variables.</p><p>The aforementioned techniques, of SPLOMs, parallel coordinates, and glyphs, all suffer from problems when naively applied to datasets with many categorical variables. An alternative approach involves "stacking" multiple categorical variables along axes, used in trellis charts and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> and more recently in the commercially successful product Tableau <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. However, dimensional stacking suffers from a combinatorial explosion if too many categorical variables are displayed at once.</p><p>Recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> offers a new solution for visualizing mdmv data, based on the observation that SPLOMs need not display scatterplots for all pairs of variables. A plot matrix could instead display different charts for different pairs of variables, which Emerson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> demonstrated with a wide variety of charts. We adapted this idea with our own technique called the Generalized Plot Matrix (GPLOM). In our approach, the visualization is simpler than in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, as we use only three kinds of charts, chosen with rules similar to those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>: scatter-plots for pairs of continuous variables, barcharts to show a continuous variable as a function of a categorical variable, and heatmaps to show some selected continuous variable as a function of a pair of categorical variables. These three charts are the minimum number necessary to cover the three possible pairings of variable types. This makes the matrix easier to understand, which could be beneficial to casual business users and other non-expert users. At the same time, we extend part of Emerson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>'s work by presenting interactive features for highlighting, selecting, searching, and filtering the data.</p><p>Both Emerson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>'s technique, and our own GPLOM, can comfortably display several categorical and continuous variables at once, avoiding the combinatorial explosion of dimensional stacking because the data can be aggregated within each chart. This makes these approaches appropriate for data with multiple categorical variables, as is common in business intelligence and other domains. These approaches can also provide the initial overview of a database shown to a user, serving as a visual launching point for further investigation. This is in contrast to the approach in Polaris <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> or Tableau <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, where the user must first select one or several variables of interest to explicitly construct a visualization. Finally, for non-expert users, the GPLOM approach has the advantage of only using three kinds of charts, avoiding the more complicated charts such as mosaic plots or box plots that may be difficult for non-expert users to understand and that don't scale as well to high cardinality variables.</p><p>Our contributions are (1) the GPLOM technique for visualizing multidimensional multivariate data using only three kinds of charts, making it as easy to understand as possible while still showing charts that are adapted to the kinds of variables involved; (2) a description of the visual design choices and features of our prototype implementation, including bendy highlights, associative highlighting, and a text search feature that highlights data, allowing users to quickly find charts of interest; and (3) an experimental comparison of GPLOM and Tableau that found GPLOM to be significantly faster in certain cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Surveys of techniques for visualizing mdmv data can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. We will consider the most relevant of these techniques, and consider a fictitious "nuts-and-bolts" dataset to illustrate some differences between previous work. The nuts-and-bolts data is stored as a table, and involves 3 (independent) categorical variables: Region (North, Central, or South), Month (January, February, ...), and Product (Nuts or Bolts). It also involves 3 (dependent) continuous variables: Sales, Equipment costs, and Labor costs. There are 3 × 12 × 2 = 72 combinations of categorical values, each corresponding to a row in a TableLens <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and FOCUS <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> (later renamed InfoZoom) provide ways to aggregate the tuples in a list such as the one above, while still presenting an essentially tabular view to the user. Both systems allow the user to sort tuples by any variable, but have limited ability to ease the understanding of multiple categorical variables.</p><p>Scatterplot matrices (SPLOMs) were proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and display a scatterplot for every possible pair of variables. Notable more recent work includes Scagnostics <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, which enable SPLOMs to scale up to many continuous variables, and Scatterdice <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, which demonstrates how they can be made highly interactive. SPLOMs nevertheless have shortcomings when used to visualize categorical variables. In <ref type="figure">Figure</ref> 1, the top three scatterplots (e.g., Month vs Region) each show a crossing of two categorical variables, resulting in an uninformative grid of points. Scatterplots showing a continuous vs categorical variable suffer from overplotting: in the Sales vs Product scatterplot, it is not obvious which of the products resulted in higher overall sales. HyperSlice <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> displays a matrix of slices of a scalar function of many dimensions, but cannot display several (dependent) continuous variables at once. The heatmaps of GPLOM, explained in the next section, are similar to HyperSlice, though GPLOM's heatmaps display aggregations of data rather than slices.</p><p>Parallel coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> show each tuple as a polygonal line intersecting an axis once for each of the variables. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows an example. The 3 right-most axes show continuous variables, allowing us to see the distribution of values along them (the range and central tendency of values, and outliers). However, the 3 left-most axes show categorical variables, where every possible combination of values is covered, resembling complete bipartite graphs. This creates ambiguities that prevent us from visually tracing a tuple across all axes (although interactive brushing could alleviate this). Various combinations of scatterplots and parallel coordinates have been proposed, displaying them side-by-side <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> or more tightly integrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, but none of these approaches facilitate the visualization of categorical variables.</p><p>Arrays of glyphs can be used to visualize mdmv data, where each glyph shows one tuple <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. This works well when there are at most 2 (independent) categorical variables. For example, an arrow plot <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> can display an arrow-shaped glyph at each of the points on a 2D grid, showing wind speed and wind direction over a geographic map. Extending this to 3 spatial dimensions results in occlusion, and beyond 3 dimensions it becomes very difficult to understand the ordering of glyphs along each dimension.</p><p>Dimensional stacking <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> allows more than one categorical variable to be mapped to the same spatial axis, and has been used in database visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 3 and 4</ref> show examples, each of which shows a total of 4 variables. The two innermost variables of the stacking determine the type of chart shown: if the innermost vertical variable is a continuous variable (e.g., Sales), and the innermost horizontal variable is a categorical variable (e.g., Month), then barcharts are used. On the other hand, scatterplots are used if the two innermost variables are continuous variables (e.g., Equipment costs vs Sales).  Each of the charts in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 3 and 4</ref> show a slice of the data, allowing the user to see more detail. For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> reveals that sales were very low in the South in April and May. By comparison, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, the Sales vs Month scatterplot also shows low sales in April and May, without revealing the Region.</p><p>The added detail visible in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 3 and 4</ref>, however, comes at the cost of exponential growth in space requirements as categorical variables are added. For example, if the dataset had an additional categorical variable Year with values 2001, 2002, ..., 2010, adding this as an outer variable to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> would increase the number of charts by a factor of 10. Partly for this reason, software like Tableau <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> does not show the user an initial visualization of the data. Instead, the user selects variables from a menu to construct the desired visualization.</p><p>The most closely related work to ours is the Generalized Pairs Plot <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, which extends the matrix in a SPLOM to allow a mix of chart types to be displayed, including mosaic plots, box plots, histograms, and density contours. As demonstrated in the next section, this is scalable to a larger number of continuous and categorical variables than previous techniques, because the space requirements scale linearly with the number of variables, rather than exponentially as with the previous example of dimensional stacking. Our GPLOM work further explores Emerson et al.'s ideas by (1) only using 3 kinds of charts, to make the visualization easier to understand by non-expert users who may simply want a visual overview of a business database as a first step in asking analytic questions; and by (2) extending the static plots in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> through interactive techniques. We also (3) empirically compared GPLOM to a commercial product and found significant advantages with GPLOM in certain cases. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> shows an example GPLOM of 6 variables. In the Sales vs Product chart, we clearly see that Bolts outsold Nuts, thanks to the use of aggregation (via a sum operator) that generated the bar heights. The overplotting seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>'s Sales vs Product scatterplot is thus avoided.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> shows the layout of a GPLOM for M categorical variables x 1 , ..., x M and N continuous variables y 1 , ..., y N . A full matrix would have (M + N) × (M + N) cells, however we only display the lower triangular half, without the diagonal, as is often done with SPLOMs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>). Thus, our GPLOM saves space compared to the full matrices in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, leaving room for interactive elements such as the infobox (discussed shortly). Other charts in these regions are possible, as demonstrated by Emerson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, such as boxplots or linecharts. However, their example plots show categorical variables with at most 4 distinct values. Complex charts, such as box plots and mosaic plots, become difficult to read with categorical variables with high-cardinality ( <ref type="figure">Figure 7)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref> shows a GPLOM for a large real-world dataset, where the categorical variables of Year, Day of month, and Carrier have 26, 31, and 32 distinct values, respectively. Restricting the GPLOM to only show 3 kinds of simple charts, namely heatmaps, barcharts, and scatterplots, helps keep the charts readable at these higher cardinality values. <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>. Example plots extracted from a matrix generated with the gpairs package in R <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Top row: boxplots over variables of cardinality 5, 13, and 35, respectively. Bottom row: mosaic plots with cardinality 3×5, 5×13, and 13×35, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">THE GPLOM VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUE</head><p>One tradeoff in designing a GPLOM is deciding if axes of the same variable should be scaled to the same range (facilitating comparisons of adjacent charts) or scaled to the maximum of the data in the chart. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, all axes are scaled to 35. However, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>, the barcharts contain (aggregated) sums, and are therefore scaled to a larger range. The scatterplots in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>, however, are still scaled to 35, to avoid having all the points clustered in a corner of the scatterplots. Furthermore, the heatmaps in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> share the same color scale, and we notice that only one of the heatmaps has a value close to the maximal red, because the other heatmaps are subdivided into months, reducing the values in them. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref> instead scales each chart independently, according to the maximal value within it. This makes better use of spatial (and color) resolution, but makes it more difficult to compare charts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Interaction</head><p>The user may interact with the GPLOM in several ways. A GPLOM contains bars and rectangles that afford easier pointing and clicking than the small points or dots in a normal SPLOM. In our GPLOM prototype, rolling the mouse cursor over a barchart bar or heatmap cell causes it to highlight. Clicking on a bar or cell selects it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Linking</head><p>Linking (or coordination <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>) between charts is shown in two ways: bendy highlights, and associative highlighting.</p><p>Bendy highlights are specialized links that connect different charts, comparable to previous work that also draw links between views <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. Bendy highlights are curved links that show the value of a categorical variable during rollover or selection. A text string is displayed at the curved corner of the link to show the category (for example, the 5-6pm departure time block is displayed as "1700-1759" on the corner of the bendy highlight in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8, A)</ref>. Bendy highlights can also help understand the relationship between a heatmap cell and other charts <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Figure 9</ref>).</p><p>Associative highlighting shows the relationship between charts when a categorical value is selected. There are three types of such highlighting. If the aggregation used in barcharts and heatmaps is the Sum or Count operator, then associative highlighting is achieved by highlighting the fraction of bars in other barcharts that is associated with the selected value ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>). This is similar to the proportional highlighting of bars in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. If, instead, the aggregation used is Average, Min, or Max, then associative highlighting is achieved by display- ing dots to show the average, min, or max value of data for the selected value ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>). Finally, regardless of the aggregation operator, the corresponding dots in the scatterplots are highlighted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Filtering</head><p>To drill down, the user can double click on a bar (such as a bar for "Year" = 2012), causing a filter to be created that restricts the displayed data to that value. This "sheds" the corresponding categorical variable, removing a row and column of charts from the GPLOM, and creates a filter box that the user can later click on to roll back up. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows the result of applying 4 successive filters: "Year" = 2012, "Quarter" = 1, etc. We call this feature "dimensional shedding".  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Infobox</head><p>Additional information about the element under the cursor is displayed in the infobox (upper right corner of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref>), which contains the results of the various aggregation operators as well as a kernel density estimate plot, allowing the user to judge whether the underlying distribution is normal or not, its modality and its skewness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.4">Text Search</head><p>Because GPLOM displays a large number of charts, it may be time consuming for users to visually scan all variable names to find a desired chart. Thus, a textual search function <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 12</ref>) allows the user to enter a string, suggests autocompletions, and highlights the corresponding elements once the string is entered. Currently, our prototype only allows the user to enter values, however it would be easy to extend the prototype to also allow entering names of variables. This feature is similar to one proposed in section 6.1 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.5">Labels</head><p>Due to the density of information displayed in a typical GPLOM, there is often insufficient room for labels showing the values of all cate- gorical variables along their axes. Instead, GPLOM relies heavily on tooltips and bendy highlights that show the value under the cursor. In our first version of the prototype, we arranged categorical values on vertical axes sorted top-to-bottom, resulting in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>, top. This resulted in many crossing bendy highlights. We therefore modified the prototype to sort values bottom-to-top, yielding <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>, middle, which is the order shown in other figures in this paper. A third possibility is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>, bottom, which avoids excessive crossed links while maintaining the usual top-to-bottom ordering of values. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 13</ref>. Variants of bendy highlights. Top: alphabetical vertical sorting (e.g., Asia, Europe, USA). Middle: reverse alphabetical vertical sorting (e.g., USA, Europe, Asia). Bottom: a "reversed" GPLOM with alphabetical vertical sorting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION</head><p>We suspect that one of the advantages of GPLOM is that users can answer questions by simply scanning for the appropriate chart, whereas in the commercial product Tableau they must explicitly construct a visualization. To investigate this idea, we performed an experimental comparison of user performance with both tools.</p><p>We chose three datasets for the experiment: a warm-up dataset (a converted sample SQL server database called Adventureworks) that was used to introduce users to both visualization tools, and two other datasets (Cars 1 , and the OnTime 2 airline delay data for the month of December 2012). Cars and OnTime were each used with one of the tools, counterbalanced for dataset and ordering. One quarter of the users did (Tableau+Cars, GPLOM+OnTime), an-1 http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/ 2 http://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp? <ref type="table">Table ID=236</ref> other quarter did (Tableau+OnTime, GPLOM+Cars), another quarter did (GPLOM+OnTime, Tableau+Cars) and the last quarter did (GPLOM+Cars, Tableau+OnTime).</p><p>Each trial required the user to answer a question about the dataset. There were 2 types of questions, and for each type of question, there could be zero or more criteria involved in the question. The type of question consisted of either questions that asked which type of trend or correlation (positive, negative or null) exists between two variables, if any, and questions that asked to find a particular data value, such as the year in which the average mileage per gallon for all cars was the highest. The criteria count ranged between zero to three criteria, so that a question "find the carrier with the highest average arrival delay" has zero criteria, while the question "find the day of the week when Hawaiian Airlines (HA) has the highest average delay for flights departing between 9:00-9:59" has two criteria (carrier=HA, departureTime=0900-0959).</p><p>In total, the experiment involved: 2 types of questions (trend or data) × 4 criteria counts (0 through 3) × 2 technique-dataset pairs (GPLOM and Tableau 7.0) × 12 users = 192 trials The 12 students who participated (11 male, 1 female) were either from the software engineering or information technology engineering programs at ETS, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Each student was assigned to one of the four between-subjects groups and was asked to explore the warm-up dataset for five minutes with one of the two techniques (either Tableau or GPLOM, depending on the participant's group), as an exploration phase. Once the five minutes were over, each participant was shown how to use the software in order to answer the questions, then presented with eight questions for the warm-up dataset. After the questions on the warm-up dataset were answered, a second dataset (either Cars or OnTime, depending on the participant's group) was shown and the participant was asked to answer questions about the new dataset. Then, the participant explored the warm-up dataset again, using the other technique, answered the same eight questions using the other technique and, finally, answered a set of questions on a different dataset than the one explored with the first technique.</p><p>None of the participants indicated that they had any prior experience with Tableau or with the GPLOM prototype. During the exploration phases and warm up trials, users were free to ask questions, and were shown all the features of the user interfaces that were necessary to answer the questions in the experiment.</p><p>The participants used a single monitor workstation equipped with a 24 inch monitor, keyboard and mouse.</p><p>The GPLOM prototype consisted of a web application built using D3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and JavaScript, running in the Chrome web browser (version 25), as well as a server-side backend. The server-side backend managed communication between the client and a MySQL server, computing agregates to be consumed by D3. It was built using the Play framework 2.0.4 and ran in production mode during user tests.</p><p>Tableau and GPLOM both connected to the same MySQL database over a wired gigabit Ethernet network.</p><p>As the GPLOM prototype was not optimized for performance, each time a participant added a filter by double clicking, a full page load by Chrome was executed, requiring Chrome to re-interpret and run JavaScript code (in theory, this could be eliminated with more careful coding) and also regenerating all charts (this is unavoidable with the GPLOM approach). We subsequently measured that the median time for all this to occur was 1.7 seconds for the Cars dataset, and 5.7 seconds for OnTime.</p><p>The questions were displayed to users on a second monitor controlled by the experimenter. When the user indicated they were ready to start a trial, the experimenter clicked a button to display the question and start a timer. The user then read the question and interacted with the visualization tool until they said they could answer the question, at which point the experimenter stopped the timer (triggering a simultaneous screen grab of the user's screen), and transcribed the user's verbal answer. The time elapsed was recorded. If the user decided they wished to check or change their answer by performing further interactions with the visualization tool, the time of their last answer determined the recorded duration. No feedback was given to indicate to the user if their final answer was correct or incorrect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Results</head><p>Because each participant was only exposed to half of the four {GPLOM, Tableau} × {Cars, OnTime} combinations, the performance data were separated by dataset for analysis. Some of the main results are summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14 and</ref>   The time taken by participants to answer was non-normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk normality test, p &lt; 0.01). The non-parametric ANOVA-type statistic (ATS) revealed that GPLOM was significantly faster than Tableau for the Cars dataset (p &lt; 0.01), and that the criteria count had a significant effect on time in both the Cars dataset (p &lt; 0.01) and the OnTime dataset (p &lt; 0.01), with time increasing with criteria count. There was no significant difference in time between GPLOM and Tableau for the OnTime dataset, although GPLOM had a lower median time (48.68 seconds for GPLOM vs 59.58 seconds for Tableau).</p><p>Examining <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref>, we note that the case where GPLOM seemed to have the least advantage with respect to Tableau was with "data" questions about the OnTime dataset when the criteria count was 2. This particular case corresponds to the only question that required the user to use the Count aggregation operator in GPLOM. In hindsight, we recall several users having difficulty with this question, and suspect that this question was relatively easier in Tableau because Tableau has a pre-defined variable "Number of records", obviating the need for users to select a Count aggregation operator in Tableau.</p><p>A logistic regression revealed that questions about the OnTime dataset had a significantly higher error rate than questions about Cars. GPLOM had a lower overall error rate than Tableau, but not significantly.</p><p>Post-questionnaires asked users to rate the two interfaces against nine criteria such as "intuitive", "easy to learn", etc. On average, users gave a higher (i.e., more positive) rating to GPLOM than Tableau for all of these criteria, but Wilcoxon signed rank tests showed that only two were significant: users judged GPLOM to be significantly more "fast" (p &lt; 0.01) and significantly more "fluid" than Tableau (p &lt; 0.05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Discussion</head><p>We did not attempt to subtract the full page load time per filter incurred by the GPLOM prototype from the recorded time taken by the participant to answer, as there is no way to differentiate between the user waiting for Chrome to render the page and the user thinking about the next filter to enter while the page is loading. It is possible that, if the page load time were reduced with better coding, this would further differentiate GPLOM from Tableau, as Tableau did not incur such an overhead.</p><p>On the other hand, the error rate with Tableau was sometimes rather high, and this may be because the users were too inexperienced with it, despite the warm up trials. It is possible that a follow-up study with more experienced users would yield different results.</p><p>Nevertheless, in our study, GPLOM resulted in a lower median time in both datasets, and a significantly lower time in the Cars dataset. A possible explanation for this difference would be the difference between the process of building a filter in each visualization.</p><p>In Tableau, the process to build a filter comprises the following steps:</p><p>1. Pick the categorical variable to filter from the list of dimensions 2. Drag the selected categorical variable to the filter shelf 3. Select the desired value for the filter from the list of possible values for the categorical variable 4. Click OK to dismiss the filter dialog box On the other hand, in GPLOM, the process to build a filter requires the following steps:</p><p>1. Locate one bar chart whose x axis corresponds to the categorical variable to filter 2. Locate the particular bar that corresponds to the desired value on which to filter by hovering over the bar and reading its associated tooltip 3. Double-click the bar Alternatively, the user can build a filter in GPLOM in the following fashion:</p><p>1. Move the mouse cursor to the search box and click it 2. Enter the desired value to search for using the keyboard 3. Move the mouse cursor to one of the highlighted bars on a bar chart 4. Double-click the bar Another explanation for the faster performance of GPLOM relative to Tableau would be the dimensional shedding feature of GPLOM. As participants drilled down in GPLOM by double clicking, the number of displayed charts was correspondingly reduced and the possible values on each chart's horizontal axis only contained the list of allowed values. In contrast, Tableau's design requires the list of dimensions (categorical variables) to stay static and building a filter often listed values incompatible with other filters. For example, even if a previous filter filtered out cars by Asian manufacturers, Honda and Toyota would still appear if the user attempted to add a filter for the manufacturer's name. Furthermore, when users built an invalid combination of filters, Tableau displayed no data at all, which stumped some participants and caused them to search (often for an extended period of time -see for example the outlier points in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14)</ref> for a reason as to why the display was completely blank. As GPLOM always shows all available data and filtering is done by picking a particular subset of the displayed data, it is impossible for a user to build such a filter combination.</p><p>Another problem participants encountered with Tableau was their building of a chart that contained too many categorical variables or did not answer the question they were asking; on the other hand, some participants answered some questions using the wrong chart in GPLOM, so the problem could be one of user education or wanting to please the experimenter by answering something.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Improvements</head><p>Several improvements can be made to the GPLOM prototype. In its current iteration, the search box only contains the data contained in the database, without mapping it to more user friendly concepts (carrier name "WN" instead of Southwest or "1" as a day of the week, instead of Monday). This confused some of the users, who tried several times, unsuccessfully, to get the search box to find the values they were looking for. Ensuring that there is a rich data dictionary that has multiple synonyms for values would significantly improve the users' experience in that regard.</p><p>Another problem was that the search box's color contrast was insufficient (see top right of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref>) and eight of the twelve users missed it entirely during the five minute exploration period. Improving its contrast and adding a magnifying glass icon might make it easier for users to discover the feature. Even when they were told that the search box existed, most users did not use it, instead using the mouse to find and select values to filter on.</p><p>One significant problem that was repeatedly encountered during user testing of the GPLOM prototype is the lack of clear affordances for interaction. Users did not seem compelled to click, much less double click, on charts. During the exploration phase, out of twelve users, only one found that it was possible to filter data by double clicking on bars, although some tried right-clicking (which only brought Chrome's default right-click menu). This lack of clear affordances meant that users often tried to click and double click on the brightly colored bendy highlight, which did nothing; in retrospect, it seems like an obvious affordance for user interaction which could be used for highlighting and filtering.</p><p>The associative highlighting, while useful for part-to-whole comparisons, was often misunderstood by users; it was almost never used to answer questions on datasets, even though it displays the exact same data that double-click filtering on a particular value would.</p><p>Another misunderstood feature was the kernel density estimate plot, which confused users much more than it helped them. We postulate that histograms, density plots, Q-Q plots, rug plots and other statistical tools, while very important to evaluate distribution shape, are unlikely to be understood by average business users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS</head><p>Despite a large variety of charts and visualizations, it remains unclear to many non-expert users how to visualize the contents of a typical database in a way that gives them an overview of variables they may not be familiar with. Many advanced techniques have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, but most of these have seen limited real-world deployment, and almost none of them are designed for the simultaneous visualization of multiple categorical and continuous variables, with the exception of Emerson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Both Emerson et al.'s approach and the GPLOM can give users a visual overview of more than 10 variables, allowing them to visually scan for interesting relationships and allow for serendipitously discovering outliers or thinking of unplanned questions for further analysis.</p><p>Compared to Emerson et al., GPLOM (1) only uses 3 kinds of charts, the minimum number necessary to cover the three kinds of pairings of variables, which may make it easier to understand for nonexpert users and scale better to high-cardinality categorical variables;</p><p>(2) demonstrates two ways of interactively linking charts, through bendy highlights and associative highlighting; (3) demonstrates text search to quickly find values of interest; and (4) saves screen space by only displaying the lower triangular half of the matrix. We also presented experimental evidence that GPLOM is sometimes significantly faster than Tableau, a commercial product, for the kinds of questions we tested.</p><p>Future work might compare the performance of the reversed GPLOM ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13, bottom)</ref> with the upright version. During the exploration phase of our study, most of the participants seemed to explore the software from top to bottom, left to right and spent most of their time trying to understand the heat maps. The reversed GPLOM would mean that the first visual elements encountered by users would be barcharts, which are easier to understand. This might better ease novice users into the GPLOM.</p><p>Future work could also compare GPLOM with other mdmv visualizations or database tools, such as xmdv, ggobi or Mondrian.</p><p>The GPLOM prototype could be modified to accommodate a wider range of user skills. Novice users could be shown only the matrix of barcharts, while more advanced types of plots (such as those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>) could be available for expert users.</p><p>There might also be hybrid ways to combine the matrix layout of GPLOM with the dimensional stacking of Polaris / Tableau, giving the user more control over the tradeoff of number of charts and level of detail.</p><p>Finally, we plan to explore ways of improving the performance of GPLOM with extremely large datasets. While performance of the GPLOM prototype on the complete OnTime dataset (≈144 million records) was still within acceptable bounds for interactive exploration, it required the usage of an in-memory columnar database running on a server with 16 dual-core processors equipped with 512 gigabytes of RAM. Incremental approaches for large data visualization, such as VisReduce <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, could also be applied to reduce the perceived system latency.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>A SPLOM of the nuts-and-bolts dataset.</figDesc></figure>
