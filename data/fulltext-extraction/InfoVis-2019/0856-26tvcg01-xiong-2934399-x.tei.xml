				<p>Fig. 1. The same data showing the relation between eating breakfast and GPA presented via text, bar graph, line graph or scatter plot. Which depiction makes eating breakfast causing higher GPA seem more plausible to you? Abstract-Students who eat breakfast more frequently tend to have a higher grade point average. From this data, many people might confidently state that a before-school breakfast program would lead to higher grades. This is a reasoning error, because correlation does not necessarily indicate causation-X and Y can be correlated without one directly causing the other. While this error is pervasive, its prevalence might be amplified or mitigated by the way that the data is presented to a viewer. Across three crowdsourced experiments, we examined whether how simple data relations are presented would mitigate this reasoning error. The first experiment tested examples similar to the breakfast-GPA relation, varying in the plausibility of the causal link. We asked participants to rate their level of agreement that the relation was correlated, which they rated appropriately as high. However, participants also expressed high agreement with a causal interpretation of the data. Levels of support for the causal interpretation were not equally strong across visualization types: causality ratings were highest for text descriptions and bar graphs, but weaker for scatter plots. But is this effect driven by bar graphs aggregating data into two groups or by the visual encoding type? We isolated data aggregation versus visual encoding type and examined their individual effect on perceived causality. Overall, different visualization designs afford different cognitive reasoning affordances across the same data. High levels of data aggregation by graphs tend to be associated with higher perceived causality in data. Participants perceived line and dot visual encodings as more causal than bar encodings. Our results demonstrate how some visualization designs trigger stronger causal links while choosing others can help mitigate unwarranted perceptions of causality.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Visualization designs affect decisions. Imagine coming across a piece of BBC news, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, showing that the number of crimes in London rises with temperature. It can be easy for viewers to conclude that warmer temperature causes violent crimes <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</p><p>Concluding causality from the visualized data alone is misguided. We can only establish a correlation -the tendency of two variables changing together -between temperature and crime rate because it is possible that other factors not shown on the graph caused the difference in the number of violent crimes. For example, when the temperature gets warmer, more people go outside, more crimes may happen overall, and thus more violent crimes. If the amount of people outside is kept constant, decreasing temperature would not likely lower crime rates. While the variables illustrated are linked, they are not necessarily causally linked. Yet, people routinely see causal relationships in data.</p><p>Confusing correlation with causation is a ubiquitous decisionmaking error. Just because two factors are correlated (i.e., they tend to co-occur together), it does not mean that one is causing the other. A large portion of work in economics, education, epidemiology, psychology and public health involves analyzing correlations in observed data, which cannot definitively establish causation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Researchers and journalists can sometimes exaggerate causal implications from these results, making it even more difficult for people to decide what kind of conclusions are sound <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. This can pave way for misunderstanding of correlation and causation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>, potentially having detrimental impact. When researchers or journalists misinterpret or misrepresent correlation for causation, for example, the general public may be misled into thinking correlated factors, such as time of getting vaccinated and time of autism diagnosis, or national debt and GDP growth, are also causally related <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. It is difficult to distinguish causation from correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Even for people who learned 'correlation is not causation' with classroom examples, it could still be challenging to apply their learning to new contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. Because establishing causal inference is complex, even trained scientists can sometimes struggle with correlation and causation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. We are interested in whether a simple change in the visualization design can reduce unwarranted conclusions of causality.</p><p>Although many have looked at the effect of visualization designs on perceptual analytic tasks such as determining anomalies or estimating data trends <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, researchers have only begun to explore the effect of visualization design on cognitive reasoning tasks, such as understanding uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>, persuading attitude or belief change <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref> or eliciting empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Previous work has demonstrated visualization designs could influence data interpretation. For example, many people conclude "on average, Dutch are taller than Americans" from a bar graph visualizing the height of Americans and Dutch, but when the same information is visualized  Recreation of BBC news article figure, "Heatwave: Is there more crime in hot weather?" <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> with a line graph, people are more likely to conclude "people get taller as they become more Dutch." <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. We suspect visualization designs can also afford different cognitive reasoning routines in data, triggering perceived causal links more or less strongly in data. Contribution: We contribute three empirical studies to examine how visualization design can afford different interpretations of correlation and causation in data. Experiment 1 finds that higher proportion of people draw causal conclusions from bar graphs and plain text compared to scatter plots and line graphs. Experiment 2 and 3 found this effect to be driven by data aggregation as well as visual encoding marks. Less aggregation (binning data into more groups) and dot encoding marks (instead of rectangular bars and lines) reduced the strength of perceived causal links in data. This work provides a first step towards design guidelines that facilitate better interpretations of correlation and causation in data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Visualization design can influence the type of information extracted and the inferences made from data. In perceptual analytic tasks, choosing the appropriate visualization designs can improve the accuracy and efficiency of information extraction. Spatially upward trends are conventionally associated with increasing values, even when the axes are reverse labelled <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Bar graphs facilitate finding clusters, line graphs facilitate finding correlations and scatter plots facilitate finding outliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. Visual marks, such as rectangular bars, lines or dots, can support different inferences about data relations based on their geometric properties. For example, lines indicate connection, arrows indicate dynamic (or causal) information <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and scattered dots each represents a value of an individual subject or collection <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>In higher-level decision tasks, visualization design also influences data interpretation and decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. People interpret climate data differently depending on whether the visualization presented percentile information versus showing the range <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In bar graphs depicting average values, people judge data values that fall within the bar as being more likely to be part of the data set than points outside the bar, despite being equidistant from the mean <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. People can be more easily persuaded by tabular designs of data when they hold strong attitudes against the depicted topic, but more easily persuaded by bar graphs when they have no strong attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. People also rely on visual salience of attributes to interpret data <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. These examples support that different visualization designs of the same data could afford different interpretation of data at a higher-level, which may extend to causal or correlational interpretations.</p><p>What types of visual formats are commonly used to present correlated data? Bar graphs, line graphs and scatter plots are common ways to depict correlated data in media <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, alongside text, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. We investigate how bar graphs, line graphs, scatter plots and text influence causal reasoning of data.</p><p>Research on perceptions of causality indicates that they can be context-dependent, in addition to being visualization designdependent. When the evidence presented aligns with people's prior experience, emotional response or beliefs, they become more likely to judge the evidence as sound <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. People often perceive high causality when they judge the evidence as sound and stop thinking through other possible explanations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Prior work suggests that persuasiveness of visualized data depends on both context (does the topic align with the viewers' prior beliefs?) and visualization designs (tabular design or bar graphs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. Thus we also examine the effect of context by testing a set of paired variables that vary in the plausibility of their causal link, which we establish in a pilot experiment.</p><p>The task people perform when viewing the visualizations may also influence the conclusions they draw. Our experiments consider two common tasks people perform when interacting with data. The first is a judgment task in which they decide whether they agree or disagree with the presented information. For example, media often present people with visualizations alongside text describing a correlational or a causal relation between depicted variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In this scenario, information consumers have to decide how much they agree with the description based on the visualized data. Judgment tasks can be evaluated by comparing participant ratings of how much they agree with statement describing a correlation or a causation. The second is a generative task where people have to independently interpret a visualization to draw their own conclusions. One example is when a data analyst working to make sense of their data hoping to deliver a research report on the newest scientific findings. In this scenario, the data analyst has to actively interpret some visualizations and generate a conclusion. Generative tasks may shed more insights on how participants interpreted data and arrived at possible correlational/causal conclusions, but because they are open-ended, they tend to be more difficult to formally evaluate. In our pilot experiment, we asked participants to generate interpretations of data, then used their interpretations to develop a taxonomy to facilitate analysis of generative tasks in Experiment 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PILOT EXPERIMENT</head><p>Taking inspiration from the anecdotes of a set of local instructors of research methods and data analytics, we generated 19 potential variable pairs, from those with plausible causal relations to those with implausible causal relations. We conducted a pilot experiment to test the perceived correlation and causation of these variable pairs.</p><p>Specifically, we surveyed 21 participants for their perceived plausibility of correlational and causal relations of the 19 variable pairs through Qualtrics on Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Participants viewed the 19 correlation and causation statement sets in random orders. For each pair, they first interpreted its message and justified their reasoning in a text box. This is the generative task. Then, on a separate page, they read a correlation statement and a causation statement, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. The correlation statement accurately describes the relation between the depicted data variables, while the causation statement attributes causal relations to the depicted data variables. They gave a plausibility rating for each (0 = extremely implau- <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. Left: recreation of NPR article "Money Buys Happiness," showing a correlation between GDP and life satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Right: recreation of the Washington Post news article figure, "Researchers have debunked one of our most basic assumptions about how the world works," showing a correlation, but not causation, between income and SAT scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. sible, 100 = extremely plausible). This task reflects the judgment tasks people would perform in real life.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Picking Statements</head><p>The participants rated their perceived plausibility of both the correlation and causation statements. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> shows the four contexts we picked with varying plausibility. These four context differed significantly in their perceived correlation and causation ratings, based on an analysis of variances, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>. We visualized information using these four contexts in Experiment 1 to investigate the effect of visualization design on perceived causality. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Qualitative Coding: Interpretation Taxonomy</head><p>To provide a structured way of interpreting participants' statements in our experiments, we analyzed the freeform written response from the generative task in the pilot, in which participants drew conclusions from the information and justified their correlation and causation ratings, to create a taxonomy to characterize these conclusions in the experiment. We identified six dimensions that could help us characterize and evaluate the conclusions participants generated -whether the participant concluded correlation, concluded causation, mentioned third variables, grouped variables together, made direct observations or explicitly stated the data to be inconclusive. Each response is coded independently on these six dimensions, which means the same response could fit into multiple categories.</p><p>Distinguishing Correlation from Causation: Referencing past work outlining a taxonomy of causal arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, we looked for causal inference patterns in the verbal responses in the generative task, to distinguish a causal interpretation from a correlational one. Specifically, words such as "causes", "leads to" and "results in" depending on the context, suggests causal interpretations, while phrases such as "as X increases, Y tend to increase" were classified as correlational interpretations.</p><p>Mentioning Third Variables: If participants discussed variables not depicted in the visualization as influencing the relations between the two depicted variables, we additionally labelled the response as "considered third variables."</p><p>Grouping Variables: Participants could also group the levels of a variable together when justifying their reasoning. For example, one could say "when X is high, Y is high, but when X is low, Y is low," which arbitrarily divides the x-variable into two dimensions. Grouping of variables may be associated with misattributed causal relations. Thus we examine variable-grouping as part of our taxonomy.</p><p>Direct Observations: We also anticipated that not all participants would provide high-level reasoning. Some could make direct observations, stating the values depicted in a visualization verbatim. "When X is 2, Y is 3" and "there is a vertical line starting at 15000" are both instances of direct observations.</p><p>Inconclusive Responses: Participants could also deem the amount of data present inconclusive without drawing any correlational or causal conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">EXPERIMENT 1 CAUSALITY IN CONTEXT</head><p>Experiment 1 investigates whether visualization design influences how people interpret correlation and causation in data, using the four variable pairs selected from the pilot experiment. We asked participants to complete both judgment and generative tasks, in which they rate how much they agree with a correlation or causation statement, and verbally interpret the information and justify their judgment task reasoning, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Participants</head><p>Participants were recruited through the Human Intelligence Task (HIT) postings on MTurk. We excluded workers who are not based in the United States, have an approval rate below 95%, failed the attention checks, entered nonsensical answers for the free response questions or failed the graph reading comprehension checks (details of these checks are included in the supplementary materials). An omnibus power analysis based on pilot effect sizes suggested a target sample of 136 participants would give us 95% power to detect an overall difference between visualization designs at alpha level of 0.05. We iteratively surveyed and excluded participants until we reached this sample size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Design</head><p>This experiment had a 4 × 4 Graeco Latin Square design. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref>, each participant saw four sets of data in the four variable pairing chosen from the pilot experiment, presented using four visualization designs. We will refer to the variable pairing as 'context.' We replicated each condition 34 times with different participants to increase the reliability in our measures. We chose three simple visualization designs commonly seen in media and education <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> -bar graphs, line graphs and scatter plots as well as a plain text, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The plain text was written to parallel the bar graph, including identical information in which one variable (X) was arbitrarily divided into two groups and the corresponding average value for the other variable (Y) at those two groups were specified. Our independent variables are the visualization design and context plausibility. Visualization design is a categorical variable indicating the design we presented the information to the participants, which could be bar graphs, line graphs, scatter plots or plain text. Context plausibility is the correlation and causation statement plausibility collected from the pilot experiment, which is a continuous variable from 0, extremely implausible, to 100, extremely plausible. We recorded the order in which the participants viewed the visualizations. We also collected demographic information such as participant age, gender, political orientation and level of education.</p><p>There were two dependent variables. Four researchers blind to both the study design and the condition manipulations coded the response in the generative task based on the interpretive taxonomy, and the participant count in each category (e.g., direct observation) was one dependent variable. The other dependent variable was participants' ratings on how much they agreed with the correlation and causation statements listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> in the judgment task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Materials</head><p>We used MATLAB to randomly generate 100 pairs of data points from a normal distribution with a correlation of 0.6 to avoid ceiling and floor effect of rating the underlying correlation as too high or too low. We visualized this dataset into a bar graph, line graph and scatter plot, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. To ensure all participants viewed the same visualized data across all conditions, we relabeled the axis to fit the context without changing the underlying dataset. For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref> shows the bar graph depicted in the four contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Procedure</head><p>Upon accepting the HIT, participants clicked on a Qualtrics link to access the experiment. Participants completed the four task trials and fin- ished with demographic questions. On each trial, participants viewed a visualization (bar, line, scatter or text) and answered two graph reading comprehension check questions. They then completed the generative task in which they wrote several sentences explaining what they concluded from the visualization and why. This was followed by the judgment task in which participants read a correlation and a causation statement (presented separately on two pages), and rated how much they agree with each on a scale from 0 (disagree) to 100 (agree), as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Causation Judgment Results</head><p>We used a mixed-effect linear model to fit the causation ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which was how much each participant agreed with the causation statements, under the four visualization designs (bar, line, scatter and text). For fixed effects, we used visualization design, causation statement plausibility, trial order and demographic information (age, gender, education and political orientation) as predictors. Because it seemed plausible that certain combinations of contexts (pairs) and visualization designs could interact to increase or lessen perceived causality (i.e., based on conventions for showing data in certain domains), we also considered an interaction between visualization design and causation statement plausibility. We used a random intercept term accounting for individual differences as random effects.</p><p>The regression model indicated a relatively large effect of causation statement plausibility (context), χ 2 =162.70, η <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> partial =0.274,p&lt;0.001, a relatively small effect of visualization design (χ 2 =11.65,η <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> partial =0.026,p&lt;0.01), and negligible interaction effect between causation statement plausibility (context) and visualization design (χ 2 =0.97,η <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> partial =0.002,p=0.81). Referencing <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure  8</ref>, participants rated bar graphs to be the most causal (M=76.59, CI 95% =[71.51, 81.76]) and text the second most causal (M=71.26, CI 95% =[65. <ref type="bibr">30, 77.23]</ref>). This largely agreed with the results from the generative tasks where participants also made causal interpretations and the most group-wise comparisons in bar graphs and text. Given the similarity between bar graphs and text, which was written to contain identical information as the bar graph (grouping the data into two groups), we suspected that perceived causality differed between visualization designs because information was organized and presented differently among them.</p><p>Line graphs and scatter plots, unlike bar graphs and text, did not group variables together. Participants rated line graphs (M=68.43, CI 95% =[62.52, 74.35]) and scatter plots (M=67.29, CI 95% =[61.52, 73.07]) the least causal, which were the two designs with the most correlation interpretation in the generative task. This suggests that the effect of visualization design on perceived causality could be driven by data aggregation and visual encoding marks. There is negligible effect of the order the visualizations were presented (χ 2 =0.11,η <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> partial =0.002, p=0.74), which means perceived causation does not depend on what was presented to them previously nor was there a learning effect. Results also indicated a comparatively small effect of gender (χ 2 =4.23,η <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> partial =0.007,p=0.040), such that male participants gave higher causation ratings, and education (χ 2 =0.4.53, η <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> partial =0.011,p=0.033), such that participants with higher levels of educating gave lower causation ratings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Correlation Judgment Results</head><p>We used a similar mixed-effect linear model to predict how much each participant agreed with the correlation statements. We kept all predictors the same with the exception of swapping the causation statement plausibility with the correlation statement plausibility. Only correlation statement plausibility had a sizable effect predicting perceived correlations (χ 2 =71.02,η <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> partial =0.141,p&lt;0.001), there was negligible effect of visualization design (χ 2 =1.98,η <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> partial =0.005,p=0.58), a small interaction between the two (χ 2 =6.15,η <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> partial =0.012,p=0.10), a tiny effect of education (χ 2 =2.99,η <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> partial =0.007,p=0.08), such that participants with higher levels of education gave lower correlation ratings. There were negligible effects of order, age and gender (details included in the supplementary materials). We can see this from the similar correlation confidence intervals in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref>. This suggests visualization design does not significantly influence people's judgment of correlation from data, at least when participants were given a concrete context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7">Qualitative Results from Generative Task</head><p>Each of generative task responses was coded as "yes" or "no" on each of the six categories, as shown in the top row of <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>.</p><p>Correlation Conclusions: Many participants appropriately inferred correlation between depicted variables, using words and phrases such as "tend to" and "the more X the more Y." A chi-square test of independence with Bonferroni adjustment suggests that varying proportion of participants drew correlation conclusions from different visualization designs (χ 2 =27.84, p&lt;0.001  <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows one example of a correlation interpretation.</p><p>Causal Conclusions Among the participants who generated causal conclusions from the data, some used causation suggestive words such as "leads to" or "causes", while others seemed to have assumed causation without using causation suggestive words. Some of these participants dismissed the visualized information as illogical because the causal relation they interpreted went against their belief or intuition. As a result, some did not reach a conclusion from the visualization, not because they were aware that correlation is not causation, but because they thought the visualization was depicting a causal relation that did not make sense to them.</p><p>For example, in response to the "spending and fitness" visualization, one participant suggested that the visualization did not make sense because "there is no correlation between the two," mistaking correlation for causation. In this case, the participant seemed to understand the notion that correlation is not causation, but assumed that the visual results implied more than just correlation nonetheless. We coded the response as both "causation" and "no conclusion."</p><p>There were also two participants who mentioned "experiments" in their responses with bar graphs, even though we specifically noted that the visualizations are generated from survey data. It is possible that some people associate bar graphs with controlled experiments, from which causal conclusions can be validly drawn.</p><p>We found several common characteristics among participants who did not assume causal relations. They questioned the directionality and predispositions, or mentioned third variables at play. For example, in the "breakfast and GPA" context, participants who did not assume causation questioned whether it is people who ate breakfast more were more likely to get good grades, or that people who were more likely to get good grades were more organized, and thus more likely to get up early and eat breakfast.</p><p>A chi-square test of independence revealed an overall effect of visualization design on whether people drew causal conclusions as defined by their generated responses (χ 2 =21.77, p&lt;0.0001). As shown in the causation column in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> Third Variables Visualization designs might influence whether people think of third variables when drawing conclusions from visualizations. We observed participants justifying both correlation and causation by connecting a third variable to the two visualized.

Grouping in Response We observed an overall effect of visualization design on the number of group-wise comparisons made (χ 2 =15.57, p&lt;0.001). Researchers coded responses as group-wise comparisons when the participant described the visualized data in two groups by one dimension and compared the two grouped values in the other dimension. For example, "The students who ate less than four breakfasts a week had a lower GPA than those who ate more than four breakfasts a week."</p><p>In 27. Direct Observations While no visualization elicited more direct observations than others χ 2 =5.09, p=0.17), we observed several direct, number-specific comparisons instead of global pattern or trend observations across all designs. For example, when viewing a bar visualization on "breakfast and GPA," one participant concluded -"On average, students who eat less than 4 breakfasts per week has average GPA around 3.0."</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, in 11.0% of the trials participants made direct observations in bar graphs (CI 95% = <ref type="bibr">[5.8, 16.3</ref> We observed two types of no conclusion responses, one in which participants inferred causality from the visualization but decided to draw no conclusion because it went against their intuition, and the other in which participants made a conscious decision not to. This could be a result of them choosing to be skeptical about the completeness of the information or being aware of "correlation is not causation." For example, in response to the "internet and homicide" context, one participant wrote "I am not sure I can conclude anything -the use of Internet Explorer may have declined at the same time the murder rate declined with no connection except coincidence."</p><p>In general, many people drew from their personal experience or knowledge to make sense of the visualized information. Congruent with prior research, most participants' first intuition is to justify a potential relation between the variables visualized, despite the plausibility of the causal link <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Few stopped and thought of "counter examples," questioned the validity of the data, or showed clear signs of understanding that correlation is not causation. Some participants used "template" words or phrases, such as "correlation is not causation" or "Y tend to increase with varying levels of X" to frame their conclusions. For example, one participant made the following conclusion in the "internet and homicide" scenario. "The graph shows that in cities with more people using Internet Explorer, there tend to be many more homicides. While the results are pretty clear, I think "correlation is not causation" should be applied here. I'm not a scientist, but I don't think the two variables are really related in any meaningful way."</p><p>It is also apparent when a participant only memorized the phrase "correlation is not causation" without truly understanding the concept. They read correlation from the data, and assumed the data to be telling a causal story as they confuse correlation for causation. But, because they were superficially aware that "correlation is not causation," they dismissed the correlation in data despite the observable correlation in data. For example, this participant was clearly aware of the phrase "correlation is not causation," but instead of critically thinking through third variables or other possibilities, quickly dismissed the data and the apparent correlation. "With only this information I can't conclude anything since I do not see any correlation. In my opinion these two variables are uncorrelated..."</p><p>Furthermore, all participants interpreted the visualization assuming the X -&gt; Y directionality, such as "as X increases Y increases." For people who made causal conclusions, all of them described the x-axis variable as the cause and the y-axis variable as the effect. This suggests that there may exist a conventional interpretation of causality in data for the x-axis variable to be seen as the cause and the y-axis variable to be seen as the cause.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.8">Discussion of Experiment 1</head><p>In general, the quantitative and qualitative results told similar stories of how, when given specific pairs of common variables, people perceived causality as more likely in bar graphs and less likely in scatter graphs. Context also had a relatively large effect on perceived causality, but the effect of visualization design on perceived causality was not context dependent. We took away the specific pairs of common variables in subsequent experiments to further examine how visualization designs influence perceived causality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">EXPERIMENT 2 AGGREGATION LEVELS</head><p>Experiment 1 found that people perceived high causality from bar graphs and low causality from scatter plots. But is this driven by properties of the visual encoding marks (e.g., rectangular bars versus circular points versus lines), or by how aggregated data is? For example, the bar graph we showed aggregated the data into 2 groups while the scatter plot did not aggregate any data, showing each data point individually. Experiment 2 tested the effect of the amount of aggregation in data on perceived causality, and whether the visual encoding marks interact with this effect by comparing bar graphs, line graphs and scatter plots. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Design</head><p>Because visualization context (i.e., what specific pair of variables was shown) did not influence the effect of visualization design on perceived causality, we omitted context from the visualizations in Experiment 2. Instead of presenting the data in four scenarios with varying plausibility, we stripped the variable names (e.g., "GPA") and replaced with abstract variable labels (e.g., "X","Y"). We operationalized the amount of aggregation as the number of bins the data is sorted in. The bar graph used in Experiment 1 aggregated the data into two bins. For Experiment 2, we additionally created bar graphs that aggregated the data into eight bins and bins. We created dot plots and line graphs using the same binned data in the bar graphs, but replacing the rectangular bars with circles and lines, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 10</ref>. Here, bar graphs depict comparisons of data between two, eight or 16 groups, which fit regular conventions of graphic communication using bar graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Line charts are also sometimes aggregated, such as when showing daily, weekly, or monthly estimates. However, conventional scatter plots typically illustrate each dot as an individual data value <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, making our scatterplot stimuli less realistic but useful for the sake of a controlled comparison.</p><p>We explicitly told the participants that the visualized data were generated by summarizing and binning data as they viewed the visualizations, as shown in the left figure in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>. To ensure the participants understood the plotted data, we created instructions with examples for participants to read through (see supplementary for the example). We asked each participant six graph comprehension questions on the specific visualizations we examined for the experiment, to confirm that participants understood the visualizations, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure  11</ref>. Similar to Experiment 1, participants who failed the comprehension checks were excluded from analysis as they did not appear to have understood the data (the full experiment and data are available as supplementary materials). Participants completed the judgment task by rating how much they agreed with correlation and causation statements, similar to Experiment 1, but we excluded the generative task as the variables were abstract.</p><p>The independent variables in this experiment are visual encoding marks, which can be rectangular bars, lines or dots, and aggregation level, which can be two, eight or 16. The dependent variables are correlation ratings and causation ratings, similar to Experiment 1. We used a 3 × 3 Graeco Latin Square design crossing visualization design and aggregation groups, similar to that in Experiment 1, which crossed visualization design and context. Each participant saw three visualizations -bar graph, line graph and dot plot, one of which aggregated into two groups, one into eight groups and other into 16 groups.

The regression model indicated a relatively small main effect of visual encoding marks (χ 2 =5.97, η 2 partial =0.020,p=0.050), such that aggregated dot plots had the highest causality ratings (M=79. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref> (top).</p><p>There is relatively large main effect of aggregation level, such that visualizations with the more data aggregation were perceived as more causal (χ 2 =117.05,η <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> partial =0.29,p&lt;0.001).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Comparing Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 Bars</head><p>Experiment 1 seemed to indicate that bar graphs conveyed a greater impression of causation than other representations, Experiment 2 suggests that this impression is due to an interaction between the visual encoding marks and aggregation level. Comparing the causation ratings of bar graphs in Experiment 2 with that in Experiment 1, as shown marked in red in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref>, we see that although participants gave lower causation ratings for bar encodings overall, if we only compare the aggregation level two bar condition from Experiment 2 with the bar condition in Experiment 1 (which is an aggregation level two bar graph with context), the two results match (p = 0.47), suggesting that bar graphs with two bars may be an interesting case study, see section 8. Examining participant quotes for the Experiment 1 in Section 4.7 (Causal Conclusions), one explanation may be that many participants associate aggregation level 2 bar graphs with controlled experiments, which can be a valid way to establish causal relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Correlation Judgment Results</head><p>We used the same mixed-effect linear model to fit the correlation ratings.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Discussion of Experiment 2</head><p>Bar visual encoding marks received the lowest causal ratings, followed by line, and dot encodings received the highest causal ratings. These ratings could be further increased or decreased by the amount of data aggregation, such that decreased aggregation (increasing the number of bins) decreased perceived causality, and increased aggregation increased perceived causality in data. However, the visualizations in this experiment all aggregated data, even at the smallest aggregation level (with 16 bins). In order to isolate the effect of visualization encoding, we test how visual encoding marks influence perceived causality when no data is aggregated in Experiment 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">EXPERIMENT 3 EFFECT OF ENCODING</head><p>The bar graphs and line graphs examined in our first two experiments aggregated data. Experiment 1 showed aggregated bars binned into two groups and a continuous line, which essentially aggregated across all levels. Experiment 2 used aggregated plots which are not commonly seen, because scatter plots and to some extent line charts don't typically depict binned data, as least as often as bar charts do. Scatter plots, for example, usually show non-aggregated raw data. One familiar instance where data is naturally dis-aggregated is a nominal list, which usually shows ranking data, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Design and Procedure</head><p>We created modified bar graphs, line graphs and scatter plots to present non-aggregated data, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 13</ref>. This modification aims to parallel the non-aggregated way that scatter plots present data in bar and line charts. For each graph, the x-axis shows the index of each data point. This is a nominal dimension in which order is typically not meaningful, such as an index assigned to each unique name of a person or university. Each of the two graphs shows the value of one variable associated with the index, and the vertically aligned bar pairs represent the variable values associated with the same index. One of the variables was sorted in increasing value to mimic the x-axis and the other is left unsorted mimicking the y-axis in a scatter plot. We made the same modification to line graphs and scatter plots, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 13</ref>. Similar to Experiment 2, the visualizations created for this experiment are not conventional and therefore may seem unintuitive to some viewers (although we do sometimes see them in the real world, as shown in the left column of <ref type="figure">Figure 3)</ref>. To ensure the participants in this experiment understood the plotted data, we created instructions with examples for participants to read through (see supplementary for example details). We applied the same exclusion criteria as those in Experiment 2.</p><p>In this within-subject design, every participant viewed all three visualization designs in different order, counterbalanced with different axis values labels. An omnibus power analysis, based on pilot effect sizes, suggested a target sample of 62 would yield enough power to detect an overall difference between visualization designs. We collected data following the same data collection and exclusion method as the previous experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Visual Mark Encoding Types</head><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref>, a mixed-model linear regression model predicting perceived causality using visual encoding type, trial order and demographic information as fixed effects and individual participants as random effects showed an effect of visual encoding types (χ 2 =15.44,η 2 partial =0.10,p&lt;0.01), such that dot encodings were perceived to be the most causal (M=55.49, CI 95% = <ref type="bibr">[49.62, 61.36]</ref>), closely followed by line encodings (M=52.02, CI 95% = <ref type="bibr">[46.19, 57.84]</ref>) and bar encodings the least causal (M=43.21, CI 95% = <ref type="bibr">[37.35, 49.07]</ref>). There is a relatively small effect of order (χ 2 =2.58,η <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> partial =0.019) suggesting that participants showed comparatively small learning effects towards the potentially unfamiliar non-aggregated visualizations, age (χ 2 =3.43,η <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> partial =0.014), such that older participants rated causation less on average, and education (χ 2 =4.84,η <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> partial =0.035), such that participants with higher levels of education gave higher causation ratings.</p><p>A mixed-model linear regression model predicting perceived correlation using the same fixed effects and random effects showed an effect of visual encoding types (χ 2 =15.17,η <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> partial =0.10,p&lt;0.01), such that dot encodings were perceived to be the most correlational (M=60. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> </p></div>

We found a relatively large effect of data manipulation (χ 2 =93. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">GENERAL DISCUSSION</head><p>Overall, the choices authors make between visual encoding marks and the amount of data aggregation likely contribute to perceived causality in data. Although our results from Experiment 1 suggest that bar charts were perceived as most likely to be causal, controlling for the amount of data aggregation in Experiment 2 and Experiment 3 suggested that the level of aggregation was the driving factor of higher perceived causality in bar graphs. We also found an effect of visual encoding marks such that bars were perceived to be less causal than line and dot encodings. However, as discussed in section 5.3, two-bar bar graphs seemed to be a special case where participants consistently perceived the relationship it depicted to be highly causal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS</head><p>As an initial investigation of how causality associated with data visualization designs, we feel that it is too early to provide concrete design guidelines to mitigate unwarranted perception of causality in visualized data. We discuss several limitations of the present study and suggest a path forward for future experiments to further understand how visualization design choices impact causality interpretations.</p><p>Special Case of Two-Bar Bar Graphs: We suspect there to be something special about two-bar bar graphs that particularly invite causal interpretations, but the present experiments do not confirm the underlying reasons why. Some participant responses suggested that two-bar bar graphs could be associated with controlled experiments. Future research could confirm whether some inferences are associated with certain visualization types, such as bar graphs with controlled experiments or line graphs with functional relationship between two variables (e.g., y = f (x)).</p><p>Aggregation in Context: We found no significant effect of context in Experiment 1, and no significant difference between causation ratings of the two-bar bar graph from Experiment 1 (with context) with that from Experiment 2 (no context). Since Experiment 2 and 3 tested abstract variable pairings (e.g., 'G and B'), future work can systematically test how aggregation level might elicit different causal interpretations within the types of concrete context used in Experiment 1.</p><p>Complex Visualizations: The present study relied on simple and common data displays, but future work could test more complex displays like dashboards with multiple displays. Some of our studies also relied on displays that were free of context (abstract variable names), and future work should confirm that the results extrapolate to visualizations embedded in context or with explanatory text.</p><p>Visual Encoding Marks: We suspect that line encodings were most likely to be associated with causality because line encodings are likely associated with continuous trends in data, which could have made the line encoding marks appear more correlational, and thus more causal. Dot encoding types, although conventionally associated with non-aggregated raw data, still depict apparent trends in data as participants could mentally draw lines connecting each points. Bar encodings, in contrast, are visually vertically asymmetrical, with the area below the mean filled and the area above unfilled. In light of previous work on bar graphs showing that this vertical asymmetry invites perceptual and cognitive biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, we speculate the vertical asymmetry made the trends in bar encoding visuals more difficult to see than trends in line and dot visuals, thus appearing less correlational, and therefore less causally perceived. Future research should empirically test our hypothesis to further understand visual reasons why bar encodings were perceived less causal than line and dot encodings.</p><p>Other Data Sets: We used the same data set to create the visualization designs in these experiments, which means the correlation depicted was always an upward trend. We purposefully chose this positive trend to avoid common reasoning errors such as misinterpreting negative correlations to be smaller than the actual correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. While the goal of this experiment is to investigate whether visualization design can elicit varying degrees of perceived causality in data, further research should investigate the impact of the strength and direction of the correlation.</p><p>Improving Taxonomy for Generative Task Evaluation: Our qualitative characterization of verbal responses could be improved. We encountered several instances of ambiguous language, such as "there is some sort of relationship between A and B," which made it difficult for researchers to decide whether the participants meant a correlation or a causal relation. Some participants used template phrases such as "correlation is not causation" and "A is correlated with B" to describe relations in data, but we lacked ways of evaluating whether they actually read a causal relation from the data or not.</p><p>Statement Choices: The present experiment only presented one type of correlation and causation statement for participants to rate their level of agreement. We purposefully avoided directly using words like 'correlation' and 'causation' to better evaluate participants' interpretation of the visualized data instead triggering knee-jerk reactions to the words 'correlation' and 'causation.' Future iterations of the experiment should test how participants would react differently to other types of statements, such as direct causal statements and non-counterfactual statements. We also did not randomize the question order such that participants always responded to the generative task first, and then the judgment task rating correlation statements followed by causation statements. Participants could be using the correlation statements as a 'baseline' to their causation statement ratings. Future research can also investigate the extent to which changing question order would influence correlation and causation ratings.</p><p>Alternative Ways to Prevent Causal Interpretations: Our work took an initial step toward showing that visualizations can be designed to mitigate misinterpretation of correlation and causation. Future experiments could investigate how other techniques, such as verbal annotation on the visualization, could reinforce better interpretation of correlation and causation in addition to visualization designs, potentially contributing to data journalism and education.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Manuscript received 31</head><label>31</label><figDesc>Mar. 2019; accepted 1 Aug. 2019.
