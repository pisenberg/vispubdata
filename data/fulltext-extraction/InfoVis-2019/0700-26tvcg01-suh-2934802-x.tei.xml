<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Graphs are ubiquitous for representing complex relationships between individuals or objects and are often used to model social interactions, energy grids, computer networks, brain connectivity, etc. The abstractness of graphs provides significant flexibility in visualization. However, dense, low-diameter subgraphs lead to confusing visualizations that appear as "hairballs". A good graph visualization should present structure quickly and clearly, and support further investigation of the data.</p><p>A key element of node-link diagrams is the layout algorithm that places nodes on the display (semi-)automatically. The problem of automatic graph layout has a rich literature, in which many approaches focus on finding an embedding of the graph by optimizing a readability metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[77]</ref>, such as symmetry of the graph, lengths of the edges, or the number of edge crossings. A significant advancement was the realization that the use of derived information, such as node rank, graph distance, or approximate clustering, could improve graph layouts <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">68]</ref>. However, many of these techniques either lack the ability to interactively manipulate the graph layout, or lack the temporal coherency of the layout necessary to make such interactions effective.</p><p>When considering graph layouts that support interactivity, perhaps the most popular (though not necessarily the best) method is a forcedirected or spring-mass layout <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>, which converts the graph into a physical system of attractive springs and repulsive forces that iteratively minimize an energy function. These systems rely upon local relationships to reveal the overall shape in the graph. The result is a method that shows topological structures in certain graphs, particularly sparse ones. However, this approach often causes unrelated or distant topological structures to overlap or cross paths, making them difficult to differentiate. Some capacity to address this problem is provided through user interaction. Unfortunately, the interaction is most often through clicking and dragging individual nodes, which is ineffective for larger graphs and constrained by the forces applied to the graph layout.</p><p>This paper addresses the interactive manipulation of force-directed graph layouts by leveraging persistent homology (PH) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">35]</ref> as derived information for the visualization of undirected graphs. PH has recently been shown to be a robust descriptor of graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">78]</ref>, and it has a few key qualities that make it ideal for this application. First, the PH calculation extracts PH features, in the form of 0-dimensional homological groups, from a graph without the need to select parameters. Second, the PH features can be quantified and ranked according to their significance, known as persistence. Third, they are invariant under small deformations, making them insensitive to noise and other small variations in data (e.g., removing a low-weight edge does not significantly change the graph) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref>. Finally, the set of all PH features produces a compressed description of the graph that can be represented using a persistence barcode <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>, which our approach uses as a graphical user interface to manipulate the graph via PH features, instead of direct node manipulation.</p><p>In brief, our approach works as follows. We embed an undirected graph in a metric space by inducing a distance between all nodes. We extract the PH features (i.e., the 0-dimensional homological features) of the metric space structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref> and sort them using their significance (i.e., persistence). Starting with a Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed layout <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>, we employ the PH features in two user-selectable ways. First, a selected PH feature can create a strong attractive force between the nodes that created the feature, causing them to contract (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Fig. 1(b)</ref>). Second, a selected PH feature can be used to partition the graph into two subsets, which are repulsed from one another (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Fig. 1(c)</ref>). The user employs as many contractive or repulsive forces as desired, in order to emphasize graph elements of interest (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Fig. 1</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(d)).</head><p>Contribution. We demonstrate the usefulness of using 0-dimensional PH features for controlling force-directed layouts. In summary: 1) we discuss extracting PH features from both weighted and unweighted graphs; 2) we introduce new forces into the layout that are derived from PH features; 3) we provide an interactive interface, based upon the persistence barcode, that allows users to interactively manipulate the layout using the PH features; and 4) we evaluate the approach by comparing it to popular force-directed layouts and clustering algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PRIOR WORK</head><p>Graph Visualization. Graph visualization is a broad area, as demonstrated by von Landesberger et al.'s survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[88]</ref>. Our treatment focuses on approaches for drawing node-link diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>, which are used to display graphs in popular visualization systems, including Gephi <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>, NodeXL <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>, and Graphviz <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>.</p><p>The first automated technique for laying out node-link diagrams was Tutte's barycentric coordinate embedding <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[86]</ref>, followed by linear programming techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>, force-directed/mass-spring embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">47]</ref>, embeddings of the graph metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>, and techniques exploiting linear-algebraic properties of the connectivity structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">56]</ref>. Hybrid approaches, such as TopoLayout <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>, analyzed graph topology to identify the best type of graph embedding. Recent work using stress majorization has introduced the ability to add constraints that enable those layouts to highlight certain properties, such as stars, clusters, or circles <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. The more challenging problem of visualizing multivariate networks has been addressed through visual analytics approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[87]</ref>.</p><p>Edge clutter presents a challenging problem for node-link diagrams. For denser graphs, edge bundling can reduce clutter by routing graph edges to the same portion of the screen <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>. In terms of quality, divided edge bundling <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[83]</ref> produces high-quality results, whereas hierarchical edge bundling <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> scales to millions of edges. There are also localized versions of edge bundling <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[91]</ref> and filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">84]</ref> that adapt the display of edges based upon a user-selected region of interest.</p><p>Other visual metaphors have been proposed to reduce overall clutter, ranging from relatively conservative proposals, such as replacing nodes with motifs <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref> based on graph topology or modules <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>, to more aggressive forms, such as variants of matrix diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref> and abstract displays of graph statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[50]</ref>.</p><p>When displaying a large dataset, it is natural to question the hard visual limits for graphs. Popular approaches such as pixel-based visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">52]</ref> encode large amounts of data within small rectangles or display pixels. Space-filling curves have also been used to build pixel-based graph visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[64]</ref>. Furthermore, using visual boosting <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[73]</ref> tailored to network data may further reveal hidden information.</p><p>Research into interactive manipulation of force-directed node layouts includes interaction techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">88]</ref> such as panning and zooming, which are used to focus on regions of interest in a graph. In addition to interacting directly with nodes in force-directed layouts <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">47]</ref>, approaches have included hierarchical layout constructions <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref> and exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">5]</ref>, fisheye lenses <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">90]</ref>, interactive refinement of automatic layouts <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>, or constraint-based optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[80]</ref>.

PH has recently been used in the visualization community for graph analysis targeting clique communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[78]</ref> and time-varying graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref>. Many of these techniques take similar approaches, using PH to summarily analyze, quantify, and compare graphs. In contrast, our approach focuses on using PH to enable interactive manipulation of the graph layout.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PERSISTENT HOMOLOGY OF A GRAPH</head><p>We first provide a theoretic framing for our approach that is grounded in PH. In Sect. 4.1 we will discuss how the restricted form of PH used in this paper is a special case of single-linkage hierarchical clustering.</p><p>To extract PH features from a graph, we apply PH to a metric space representation of the graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref>. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> for an introductory survey and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref> for a formal treatment of PH.</p><p>In algebraic topology, 0-dimensional homology groups of a graph describe the connected components of a metric space at a single spatial  resolution. In this paper, we use a multiscale notion of homology, persistent homology (PH), to describe the evolution of features of the space at different spatial resolutions.</p><p>Given a weighted graph G = (V, E, w) with positive edge weights defined by w : E → R, our first step is to associate the graph G with a metric space representation. Considering the inverse 1 of the positive edge weight as the length of an edge, a classical shortest path metric d is defined on G, where the distance between each pair of nodes x, y ∈ G is the shortest path between them. This metric can be computed using Dijkstra's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2(a)</ref> for an illustration. The remainder of the algorithm operates only on the metric space, no longer considering the original graph.</p><p>Every node in G corresponds to a point in the metric space. To compute the 0-dimensional PH of G, we apply a simple geometric construction on its metric space representation. Consider the set of balls centered at every point in the metric space with a diameter t. We keep track of how the components of the union of balls evolve as t increases from 0 → ∞. As t increases, the unions of balls form components in a hierarchical fashion.</p><p>Considering <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2(b)</ref>, starting with each point as a component when t = 0, as t increases, the number of components decreases by one when two components merge-formally, this is referred to as a topological event 2 . At t = 1/4, the balls representing v 2 and v 3 touch, causing the merging of the components {v 2 , v 3 }. At t = 1/3, the balls representing v 1 and v 2 touch, causing the merging of sets {v 1 } and {v 2 , v 3 }. At 1/2, v 1 and v 3 touch. However, they are already part of the same component</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">{v 1 , v 2 , v 3 }, meaning no merging occurs. Finally, at t = 1, v 3 and v 4 touch, merging the components {v 1 , v 2 , v 3 } and {v 4 }.</formula><p>A PH feature corresponds to the birth (appearance) and death (merging) of a component (union of balls) in the metric space. The birth of a component is the diameter when the component appears. In our case, all points appear simultaneously with diameter 0. The death is the diameter at which a component disappears; that is, when two components merge, one will disappear by joining the other (the choice of which disappears is discussed in the next section). The lifetime of a component (i.e., its death time minus its birth time) is its persistence.</p><p>The PH features associated with G are placed into a persistence barcode <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>, which consists of a collection of bars, each corresponding to a single PH feature, whose starting and ending points correspond to the birth time and the death time of its associated component, with a width proportional to its persistence. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>(c) for an illustration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">COMPUTATION OF PERSISTENT HOMOLOGY</head><p>The restricted form of PH used in this paper is functionally equivalent to single-linkage clustering. Therefore, the PH of the graph can be calculated by finding the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the graph using Kruskal's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Fast Computation of the 0-Dimensional Barcode</head><p>In using Kruskal's algorithm to compute the 0-dimensional barcode of the graph G, we suppose for simplicity that G is connected. However, if it is not, each connected component of the graph is processed independently. In a nutshell, our algorithm consists of computing the MST T of G = (V, E, w) based on its metric space embedding using edge lengths 1/w. The algorithm starts by creating an empty spanning tree. It then creates components C i and bars B i , one per graph node. Each bar in the persistence barcode is represented by a pair of real numbers (birth, death), initially birth = 0 for each node as its own component. The second step of the algorithm looks at the edges one at a time, ordered by increasing 1/w i . For each e i , we check if nodes of this edge belong to two different components. If this is the case, then we merge the components and set the death of one to be the 1/w i . The choice of which component dies is arbitrary and does not influence our result. The persistence of the component that dies is its death time minus its birth time. The appearance and the disappearance of such a component gives rise to a bar (0, 1/w i ) in the persistence barcode. This step can be performed efficiently using the disjoint set data structure.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Let V = {v 1 , •••, v</formula><p>Data: A weighted graph G = (V, E, w) Result: Minimum spanning tree T and 0-dim barcode B 1 Create an empty spanning tree</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">T = {} 2 foreach node v i do 3 Create a component C i = {v i } 4</formula><p>Create a bar B i with birth = 0 and death = ∞ The addition of an edge to the spanning tree coincides with the event of two components merging. Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between edges of the MST T and the 0-dimensional barcode of G with finite persistence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Node Relationships with the Spanning Tree</head><p>We relate information encoded by the MST to the graph G, which will later define modifications to the graph layout. Denote the MST as T (V, E), where E denote the edges in the tree. Deleting an edge e = (u, v) from E splits the tree T into two sets,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">V u and V v .</formula><p>Each PH feature (i.e., a bar in the barcode) is associated with the following information, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 3</ref>:</p><p>For our purpose, we visualize each bar in the persistence barcode as an interval (0, w) instead of (0, 1/w). Such a visualization emphasizes high weight edges as long bars <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">3</ref> . Under an abuse of notation, the persistence measure of such a bar is assigned w.</p><p>The cause of death, u and v, are the nodes of the edge that cause the components to merge. These nodes will be used to modify the graph layout to the reflect PH feature selection. The subsets of nodes, V u and V v , represent the sets of connected nodes after the removal of the edge from the MST. These sets will also be important when updating the graph layout.</p><p>The subset ratio is a measure of the number of nodes, |V u | :  However, we observed in our examples that low ratios are far more common than balanced ratios. </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">|V v</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Application to Unweighted Graphs</head><p>The calculation described above requires a weight on the edges of the graph. For unweighted graphs, a similarity measure, such as the Jaccard index <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref>, can take the place of edge weight. Our procedure first gathers for each node a neighborhood or ego graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[66]</ref> within a user-selectable number of hops. For example, a 1-hop ego graph will contain adjacent neighbors, whereas a 2-hop ego graph will contain both 1-hop neighbors and nodes adjacent to the 1-hop neighbors. The ideal number of hops is data dependent. We used 1-hop for denser graphs and 2-or 3-hops for sparser graphs. Then, given an edge e = (v i , v j ), with neighborhood graphs N i and N j , the Jaccard index between those nodes is J(</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">v i , v j ) = |N i ∩N j | |N i ∪N j | .</formula><p>The edge weight becomes w(e) = J(v i , v j ). In this way, the Jaccard index provides the similarity between the neighbors of 2 connected nodes. Finally, we proceed with the approach described in Sect. 3.</p><p>Other measures, such as edge centrality <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref>, can be used in place of the Jaccard index, to highlight different aspects of the graph. The only requirement is that the measure must provide a weight on the edges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">VISUAL DESIGN AND INTERACTION DESIGN</head><p>Our design goal is to use the PH of a graph as a control to manipulate its force-directed layout. We use a simple interactive interface to provide contextual information and enable fast manipulation of the layout.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Graph Drawing</head><p>Our design uses a force-directed layout, with optional edge bundling. Force-Directed Layout. A graph is initially drawn with a Fruchterman-Reingold (F-R) force-directed layout <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. The layout starts with three types of forces. The first force enables all nodes to repulse one another ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 5(c)</ref>). The second force is a spring attraction for nodes connected by an edge ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 5(d)</ref>). Finally, a weak attracting force draws all nodes toward the middle of the display, essentially centering the layout ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>(e)). The parameters for these forces, such as mass, force strength, and spring resting length, require manual tuning.  Edge Bundling. For analysis tasks that benefit from further clutter reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">63]</ref>, edge bundling can be optionally used to reduce the distractive impact of overlapping edges. Since the layout is actively manipulated, we require an edge bundling implementation that is temporally coherent. To accomplish this, we implemented force-directed edge bundling <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>. This technique subdivides edges and uses a variant of a force-directed layout to attract edges with similar proximity and direction. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Fig. 1</ref> shows an example with edge bundling enabled. Node Coloring. Some of our experimental graphs have categorical data attached to the nodes and are colored using a categorical color map. Other graphs contain nodes colored using node degrees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Persistence Barcode</head><p>As mentioned in Sect. 4.2, we visualize the persistence barcode in a unconventional way. A PH feature that is born at 0 and dies at 1/w is visualized by a bar (0, w) whose length indicates its persistence measure w. That is, the larger the bar, the more "important" the PH feature it represents. We augment the barcode with additional visual encodings ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 5(b)</ref>) to further guide interaction. Subset Ratio. Each bar is augmented with a vertical line, splitting it into two based upon the Subset Ratio. For example, in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5(b)</ref> the bottom bar, representing e 3 from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2 and 3</ref>, has a 50/50 split, because two nodes exist on either side of the edge in the MST (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 3</ref>).</p><p>Color. For graphs with categorical data, each side of the split is colored based on the category of the Cause of Death nodes for the PH feature. Bar Sorting. Bars are sorted based upon two criteria. The first is persistence from low to high, which helps to differentiate high persistence features from those with low persistence. If the persistence values of two bars are equal, then they are sorted by their Subset Ratios, with bars having 50/50 ratios appearing lower in the barcode, since those are more central to the MST.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Interaction Using the Persistence Barcode</head><p>PH Feature Contraction. In certain scenarios, it is desirable to shrink space allocated to nodes in the layout, making more room for other parts of the graph to be displayed. We provide a persistence simplification tool that enables contraction of all PH features whose persistence is below a user-selected threshold. This interaction is done by dragging a filter bar at the top of the barcode; see the filter bar in red in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 6(c)</ref>.</p><p>As the threshold is dragged left to right, PH features with persistence below that threshold will have their color washed out and their graph nodes contracted. A contraction is accomplished by adding a strong spring force between the cause of death nodes for the event. The scale of this force is user selectable. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 6</ref>(a) illustrates this force and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 6</ref>(e) shows an example of the contraction. PH Feature Repulsion. In other situations, stretching out the graph can clear space for nodes and edges that might otherwise be overlapping and difficult to track. When a bar is individually selected, the bar color is darkened, and a strong repulsive force is added between the subsets of nodes associated with that PH feature. The scale of the force is user selectable. The repulsion of the nodes from these two groups allows the layout to cluster. For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 6(b)</ref> illustrates the force when the bottom bar in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 6(d)</ref> is selected for repulsion, causing the subsets to push apart. In other words, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 6(b)</ref>, all the points in the blue region have an additional repulsion from all of the points in the purple region and vice versa. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 6(f)</ref> shows the result of adding this force to the graph. Selecting Multiple Bars. Multiple bars may be selected for contraction and repulsion, since the forces do not directly depend on each other. Whenever a new bar is selected, the force is simply added to the layout. Preview Hovering. To help users preview the impact of a bar's selection when the mouse hovers over a bar in the barcode, set visualization can be employed, such as bubble sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref> or kelp diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>. We employ bubble sets on the subsets of nodes to differentiate which nodes belong to which subset. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 7</ref> shows examples of bubble sets employed on a dataset. The bubble sets demonstrate two examples of before and after the PH feature is selected for repulsion, respectively. Hyperbolic Zoom for a Large Barcode. The number of bars is equal to the number of nodes in the graph minus one. In order to scale the barcode appropriately for a large graph, a scrollbar with hyperbolic zoom is placed to the right of the bars. As the scrollbar moves, the focus of the hyperbolic zoom is modified to emphasize the associated bars. An example of this can be seen in our accompanying software.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Typical Usage Session</head><p>After a graph is loaded and any adjustments are made to standard force strengths, the user begins to explore the PH features of the graph. To start, the contraction forces are explored by slowly adjusting the threshold higher (to the right), which enables finding when the compactness reaches a desirable level. Next, the PH features are explored for repulsive forces. PH defines the elements with the highest persistence to be the "most important". Therefore, we typically start by looking for high persistence bars with a higher subset ratio and/or bars that split between different categories for labeled data. Hovering over a bar first informs the user if the partitioning may be interesting. Examples of interesting partitions include, but are not limited to, partitions that are mixed together (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 7(a)</ref>) or a cluster of nodes already spatially co-located that the user would like to move away from the rest of the graph (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 7(b)</ref>). If the user finds the partition interesting, the repulsive force is enabled by clicking. Typically, we found a good layout was achieved by selecting 5-10 bars for repulsion, although this is by no means a limit. Usually, the entire process took no more than a few minutes to sufficiently investigate and fine-tune the graph layout. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">RESULTS</head><p>To evaluate using PH to guide force-directed layouts, we examine 12 datasets using hand-tuned layouts (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Our evaluation considers the following:</p><p>We examine the scalability of our approach to quickly calculate PH and update the graph layout fast enough to support interactive visualization, using graphs up to 10,000 nodes or 100,000 edges.</p><p>We measure the quality of the layouts produced by our approach. We compare the layouts produced by our approach to popular force-directed layout methods and clustering techniques. We present three brief case studies on real-world data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Performance</head><p>The accompanying software is implemented using Processing [2]. All calculations are performed on the CPU. The force calculations are multithreaded. The live footage from the accompanying video was produced on a 2017 MacBook Pro with a 3.1 Ghz i5 processor to demonstrate the interactivity of the interface. Once the data is loaded, the 0-dimensional PH features are extracted. The MST calculation is a variation of Kruskal's algorithm performed on the metric space. It is implemented using disjoint sets taking O(|E|α(|V |)), where α is the inverse Ackermann function <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>, an extremely slow growing function. After the MST is found, determining the node subsets (see Sect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">4</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>.2) takes O(|V |).</head><p>For the F-R force-directed layout, we use the Barnes-Hut approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>  To improve interactivity of the visualization on larger datasets, certain noncritical features are disabled. For example, edge bundling is automatically disabled when the number of edges is greater than 500. In addition, bubble sets are disabled when the number of nodes is greater than 100. Instead, the graph nodes are surrounded by a halo, which is colored according to the set they belong to.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref> generated by Graphviz <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref> using Jaccard index for edge weights; (c) our approach: only contraction is applied; (d) our approach: only repulsion is applied; and (e) our approach: both contraction and repulsion are applied.</p><p>To show that the performance of our approach is comparable to other techniques, we report computation times in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. For our approach, the category Computation is the time needed to calculate the PH and determine the node subsets. For Neato <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref>, it is the time to converge. For hierarchical clustering, it is the time to compute the entire hierarchy. These computations occur only once, when the data is loaded. The category Layout is the time in milliseconds (ms) needed for one iteration of the force-directed layout calculation. Our implementation runs one iteration per rendering frame. In addition, many of our examples include frame rate, reported as frames per second (FPS). This number is generally less relevant, as it includes the extra costs of rendering, edge bundling, etc., which are mostly fixed costs.</p><p>The results demonstrate that, for all datasets, our approach has the scalability necessary to be utilized in interactive visualization. The PH calculations take at most a few seconds, and the time required for most layouts is less than 10 ms; for the larger graphs tested, it is always less than 100 ms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Layout Quality</head><p>To assess the responsiveness of our approach, we introduce a measure specifically designed to quantify how well the resulting layouts reflect user intentions in emphasizing or de-emphasizing selected PH features. The approach works by comparing the PH of the embedded graph nodes of the layout before and after user modification. The approach starts by calculating the PH of the nodes of the source F-R force-directed layout (without any contraction or repulsion) using Euclidean distance between nodes 4 . Then, the PH of the user-selected target layout is calculated similarly.</p><p>Given a source and target, we extract the set of bars from each that are selected by the user for contraction (C) and repulsion (R). The persistence of those bars in the source and target is P S and P R , respectively. The effect of contraction (E C ) and repulsion (E R ) are calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">E C = 1 |C| ∑ x∈C P S (x) − P T (x) P S (x) , E R = 1 |R| ∑ x∈R P T (x) − P S (x) P S (x)</formula><p>The results appear in the final two columns of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, comparing the source layout (F-R layout listed in the table) to the target layout (our approach). Intuitively, this measure quantifies how much on average the features of a layout have been contracted or repulsed in the target layout  relative to the source layout-negative is undesirable; zero means no impact; positive is desirable and the larger the better. For the most part, our approach shows a substantial positive impact from the applied contraction and repulsion, indicating the user's intentions have been reflected in the layout. The notable exceptions are that some datasets have a negative contraction effect. For these examples, negativity does not mean that the contraction is entirely ineffective-in reality, the repulsive effect just overpowers the contractive effects on some parts of the layout, leading to an average effect that is negative.</p></div>

Bcsstk is a symmetric stiffness graph containing 110 nodes and 364 edges. 6-ary is a balanced tree of depth five containing 9331 nodes and 9330 edges. Barbell is a simple graph connecting two complete subgraphs of 50 nodes each with a bridge of 50 nodes, totaling 150 nodes and 2501 edges. Lobster is a tree with the property that the removal of leaves results in a caterpillar graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref>. For all layout methods, each graph has weights applied by using the method described in Sect. 4.3 with the following neighborhood size: Bcsstk: 1-hop; 6-ary: 2-hop; Barbell: 1-hop; and Lobster: 1-hop. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 8</ref> shows three examples of our approach using contraction only, repulsion only, and a combination of both.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.2">Comparison to Hierarchical Clustering</head><p>Next, we compare our approach to modularity-based hierarchical clustering.

The algorithm begins by initializing each node in the graph into its own cluster. The 2 clusters whose merging will cause the largest increase in modularity are then combined.

Although Rodriguez created this graph layout to highlight the central core of the network, it is difficult to identify whom he calls the "three most central players" involved in the Madrid bombing. When selecting a number of bars for contraction and repulsion, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Fig. 11(b)</ref>, the graph closely corresponds with the analysis provided in the paper. Jamal Zougam, Mohamed Chaoui, and Said Berrak are the three most central players in the Field Operations Group network, with all three central to the graph. Below Zougam is Abdeluahid Berrak, who was suspected to be responsible for recruiting new members to the Field Operations Group. Another central player highlighted in Rodriguez's analysis is Abderrahim Zbakh, known as "The Chemist". In the original layout, his node is not remarkable; yet, Rodriguez described Zbakh as "cementing the network" by uniting unacquainted members of various terrorist groups.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">DISCUSSION</head><p>Transferability to Other Force-Directed Layout Algorithms. F-R force-directed layout was used as our reference layout. Since our modification uses only additional repulsive and spring forces, by and large, other force-directed layout variants, such as sfdp <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref> or FM <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">3</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>, should be able to adapt our approach to their algorithms and see benefits similar to those we have demonstrated.</p><p>Relationship to Hierarchical Clustering. Calculating 0-dimensional PH features has a strong relationship to finding hierarchical clusters. However, the main differentiating factor is the treatment of features in PH. For example, PH sees low-weight edges as "noise", and hence collapsing them makes sense. At the same time, it sees high-weight edges as signals, and hence separating such features is meaningful.</p><p>(Semi-)Automatically Selecting Features. Given the procedure defined in Sect. 5.4, it is possible to imagine that a (semi-)automatic heuristic-based approach could be used to initialize the contraction and repulsion. We did not pursue such an approach for two reasons. First, the amount of interaction saved by such an approach would not be that significant. In our experience, exploring the contraction and repulsion options takes only a few minutes. Second and more importantly, the interaction process provides intuition about the graphs. This intuition is critical in selecting a final graph layout.</p><p>Disconnected Graphs. In the case of a disconnected graph, PH calculations work without any modification by recognizing that disconnected components never merge. After that, our approach considers each connected component in the graph separately.</p><p>Limitations. Our approach is not without limitations. The first problem is that force-directed layouts are, by their nature, over-constrained. Adding additional forces can exacerbate this problem. We see this in a number of examples that have negative results for contraction effectiveness (see Sect. 6.2). Second, there is the possibility for selectiveengineering of the layout. Users can choose to ignore or select any PH feature to repulse, which could lead to intentionally ignoring important PH features in the final layout. Next, the worst case number of interactions needed can be quite large. To test every possible contraction and repulsion requires 2|N| interactions, not to mention the cost of testing combinations. Fortunately, we find the actual interaction process to be fairly quick for high-quality results (see Sect. 5.4). Finally, our approach assumes that a unique MST exists for an input graph. If such an assumption does not hold (for example in Sect. 6.4.2), an arbitrary tree from the set of MSTs is selected. Selecting an optimal MST using various constraints deserves future investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION</head><p>We have presented a new approach to graph drawing that uses PH to interactively modify a force-directed layout. The approach provides a flexible interface for selecting layouts that highlight features of the graph, as defined by PH. In the future, we would like to look at the potential of using higher-dimensional PH features to control graph drawing. For example, 1-dimensional PH features encode tunnels within metric spaces, which would be useful in constraining similar structures in the graph. However, with higher-dimensional PH features, finding the set of points that generate these features is a nontrivial problem.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Manuscript received 31</head><label>31</label><figDesc>Mar. 2019; accepted 1 Aug. 2019.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">The inverse of the edge weight between two nodes 1/w(x, y) captures the dissimilarity between them.2 In this context, topology refers to the homology groups of the metric space, not to be confused with graph topology.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3">This visualization is different from the conventional PH approach; however it is justified as edges with higher weights w are considered more important in our setting.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">Note, this calculation does not consider the connectivity of the graph.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="5">We suspect some form of force-directed layout was used originally, but that information is not documented.</note>
