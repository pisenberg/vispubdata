				<p>Fig. 1. Vortex formation, attachment and shedding on the left forewing and hindwing of a dragonfly during takeoff. Abstract—We present the visual analysis of a biologically inspired CFD simulation of the deformable flapping wings of a dragonfly as it takes off and begins to maneuver, using vortex detection and integration-based flow lines. The additional seed placement and perceptual challenges introduced by having multiple dynamically deforming objects in the highly unsteady 3D flow domain are addressed. A brief overview of the high speed photogrammetry setup used to capture the dragonfly takeoff, parametric surfaces used for wing reconstruction, CFD solver and underlying flapping flight theory is presented to clarify the importance of several unsteady flight mechanisms, such as the leading edge vortex, that are captured visually. A novel interactive seed placement method is used to simplify the generation of seed curves that stay in the vicinity of relevant flow phenomena as they move with the flapping wings. This method allows a user to define and evaluate the quality of a seed&apos;s trajectory over time while working with a single time step. The seed curves are then used to place particles, streamlines and generalized streak lines. The novel concept of flowing seeds is also introduced in order to add visual context about the instantaneous vector fields surrounding smoothly animate streak lines. Tests show this method to be particularly effective at visually capturing vortices that move quickly or that exist for a very brief period of time. In addition, an automatic camera animation method is used to address occlusion issues caused when animating the immersed wing boundaries alongside many geometric flow lines. Each visualization method is presented at multiple time steps during the up-stroke and down-stroke to highlight the formation, attachment and shedding of the leading edge vortices in pairs of wings. Also, the visualizations show evidence of wake capture at stroke reversal which suggests the existence of previously unknown unsteady lift generation mechanisms that are unique to quad wing insects.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p> Insects are the undisputed masters of flapping flight in the microaerial world, however their flight seems impossible based on traditional notions of aerodynamics. Recently researchers have been using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to analyze insect flight <ref type="bibr" coords="1,266.73,562.58,10.50,9.96">[1] </ref>in hopes of identifying unsteady lift production mechanisms which could in turn be applied to developing more efficient micro air vehicles (MAVs). In particular, the dragonfly has emerged as an important model organism for the development of quad wing <ref type="bibr" coords="1,244.73,602.60,26.75,9.96">MAVs. </ref>In this work, we present a visual analysis of the flow induced by the flapping wings of a digitally reconstructed Eastern Pondhawk Erythemis Simplicicollis dragonfly as it performs a backward takeoff maneuver. Vortex formation surrounding the wings is the most desirable phenomena to capture visually due to its role in lift production. Unsteady 3D flow visualization is already very challenging <ref type="bibr" coords="1,335.05,592.58,9.53,9.96" target="#b0">[2]</ref>, but the addition of multiple dynamically deforming wings to the flow field further complicates the problem. Feature-based methods for vortex region and core detection as well as integrationbased flow lines such as streamlines, path lines, streak lines and generalized streak lines <ref type="bibr" coords="1,377.34,632.60,10.50,9.96" target="#b1">[3] </ref>were applied to the dragonfly flow data in hopes of capturing various lift production mechanisms. A novel integration-based technique which we call flowing seed points is introduced to address several of the issues encountered when applying traditional flow lines to the dragonfly data. Also, a novel interactive seeding method is introduced. It is based on the fact that the most interesting flow phenomena generally occurs near and moves with the wings. This technique allows users to quickly define and evaluate the quality of a moving seed point over a series of thousands of time steps, while only working at a single time step. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>This section discusses previous work related to unsteady flow visualization of insect flight. Flapping flight theory is covered, so that the discussion of visualization methods can be done with a firm understanding of which flow features are important in the production of lift. Related works in the areas of unsteady flow visualization, vortex detection and applied flow visualization are also presented. For an overview of the general issues of flow visualization and vortex detection please refer to <ref type="bibr" coords="2,111.38,245.66,9.70,9.96" target="#b0">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,123.37,245.66,6.47,9.96" target="#b2"> 4]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Flapping Flight Theory</head><p>Insects operate at ultra low Reynolds numbers where viscous effects are dominant. Several theories as to how they generate the necessary lift and propulsion have been proposed. For dragonfly flight, the most relevant theory is the leading edge vortex hypothesis <ref type="bibr" coords="2,215.11,307.64,9.54,9.96" target="#b3">[5]</ref>. The theory is that fluid separates from the sharp leading edge of an airfoil and is then drawn into a vortex, which creates a low pressure region above the wing resulting in higher lift production. Studies of the leading edge vortex (LEV) have produced different results in 2D and 3D. Dickinson and Götz showed that in a 2D air foil moving with a high angle of attack, the LEV grows until flow reattachment can no longer occur <ref type="bibr" coords="2,156.66,377.66,9.52,9.96" target="#b4">[6]</ref>. Sane demonstrated that lift production in 2D air foils is time dependent with the maximum lift occurring just before the LEV is shed <ref type="bibr" coords="2,165.06,397.64,9.53,9.96" target="#b5">[7]</ref>. In a 3D study Ellington et al. observed that the LEV grows to a certain point and then remains attached during the down-stroke <ref type="bibr" coords="2,148.03,417.68,9.53,9.96" target="#b6">[8]</ref>. Willmott's work with tethered hawkmoths <ref type="bibr" coords="2,67.20,427.64,10.52,9.96" target="#b7">[9] </ref>has also identified the dynamic stall that occurs when the angle of attack is rapidly changed as a way to generate lift. In addition Dickinson et al. concluded that delayed stall, rotational circulation and wake capture all contribute to lift production <ref type="bibr" coords="2,242.03,457.64,13.76,9.96" target="#b8">[10]</ref>. Although researchers in the bio-fluid field <ref type="bibr" coords="2,190.93,467.66,15.01,9.96" target="#b9">[11] </ref>agree that the LEV is the main source of lift production for large insects, it is not clear why it grows to a certain size and then stabilizes in the 3D case but not the 2D case. Thus, the primary goal of any visualization method applied to this data is to capture the formation, attachment and shedding of leading edge vortices as well as clues, such as spanwise flow, as to why they are more stable in the 3D case. A secondary visualization goal is to capture visual evidence of unsteady lift production mechanisms unique to quad wing insects, such as wake capture between forewing and hindwing. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">BACKGROUND</head><p>In order to be confident in one's visualization results it is essential to start with accurate data. Thus, this section gives a brief explanation of the processes involved with generating an accurate simulation of dragonfly flight. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Photogrammetry</head><p>The photogrammetry setup used to capture images of dragonflies in flight consists of three synchronized Photron FASTCAM SA3 60K high-speed cameras with 1024x1024 pixel resolution. They were aligned orthogonal to each other and operated at 1000Hz. A calibration object was made using a 3D Systems ProJet HD-3000 rapid prototyping machine and the cameras were calibrated using the direct linear transform algorithm. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">3D Reconstruction</head><p>Prior to filming, the dragonfly's wings were each marked in a grid pattern with black ink marker points. These marker points were then tracked in each series of images from the high-speed cameras. Using perspective projection equations and the transformation parameters achieved through calibration, it is possible to reconstruct the true 3D location of marker points found in two or more images for any time step. Template wing models, created with Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces, were used as the basic shape of each wing (<ref type="figure" coords="3,220.94,334.16,32.56,9.96" target="#fig_1">Figure 2a</ref>). The 3D reprojected marker points were then converted into surfaces by iteratively aligning the corresponding points on the template models to them (<ref type="figure" coords="3,47.08,364.16,32.66,9.96" target="#fig_1">Figure 2b</ref>). A texture was applied to the models in order to aid in the perception of wing twist and camber (<ref type="figure" coords="3,182.83,374.18,31.86,9.96" target="#fig_1">Figure 2c</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Simulation</head><p>A high-fidelity in-house direct numerical simulation (DNS) tool, which is based on an existing Navier-Stokes immersed-boundary solver <ref type="bibr" coords="3,48.31,426.14,13.76,9.96" target="#b38">[40]</ref>, was used to simulate the flow induced by the flapping wings. It is capable of simulating flows with complex moving boundaries including membranous and solid bodies on stationary Cartesian grids <ref type="bibr" coords="3,79.56,456.14,13.71,9.96" target="#b39">[41]</ref>. The solver employs a non-dissipative, 2nd-order, central-difference scheme <ref type="bibr" coords="3,126.65,466.16,13.78,9.96" target="#b38">[40]</ref>, which is critical for accurately predicting vortices. Our dragonfly was flying at a Reynolds number of 350 based on its body's reference velocity. The simulation was performed on a Cartesian grid with dimensions 176x152x192. In total, 0.08 seconds of flight, containing three wing beats, was simulated. Vector field data was exported at 1600 time steps, resulting in approximately 1.4 terabytes of data to be visualized. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">METHOD</head><p>This section discusses the theory behind the visualization techniques applied to the dragonfly data. The flowing seed point method, which combines streamlines and streak lines, is introduced. Also a novel way to interactively define and evaluate seed curves through every time step of an unsteady flow with immersed boundaries is explained. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Feature-Based Vortex Detection</head><p>Vortex feature extraction in the dragonfly simulation was done with the vortex region detection algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="3,174.89,644.18,15.00,9.96" target="#b26">[28] </ref>and the Sujudi Haimes eigenvector method <ref type="bibr" coords="3,97.41,654.14,13.76,9.96" target="#b21">[23]</ref>. According to the -definition, the velocity gradient is decomposed into its symmetric part, the rate-of-strain tensor , and its antisymmetric part, the vorticity tensor Ω. They then define a vortex as a contiguous region where the intermediate eigenvalue of the symmetric real tensor + Ω is negative. Lower values of indicate stronger vortices. </p><formula>= 1 2 [ + ( ) ] Ω = 1 2 [ − ( ) ] </formula><formula>(1) </formula><p>The eigenvector method for core line extraction <ref type="bibr" coords="3,491.18,239.30,15.02,9.96" target="#b21">[23] </ref>identifies locally swirling flow by looking at points where the velocity gradient has one real eigenvalue and a pair of complex-conjugate eigenvalues. At these points, the velocity component in the direction of the eigenvector corresponding to the real eigenvalue is subtracted. Centers of rotation are computed on tetrahedral cell faces and connected with line segments to produce a vortex core lines. Haimes and Kenwright's alignment algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="3,373.00,309.32,15.01,9.96" target="#b40">[42] </ref>was also employed to produce more contiguous core lines. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Flow Line Theory</head><p>Streamlines are trajectories in time independent vector fields. They are tangent to the vector field at all points and are described by the following differential equation: </p><formula>() = =((), ,) (2) </formula><p>Where () is a point along the streamline, is the underlying vector field, is a time-independent parameter and selects the simulation time step from which all of the vectors are taken. Streamlines proved effective for visually capturing the LEV due to the easily identifiable helix shape. They can be used with unsteady flows by integrating from the same seed point or a moving seed point at each time step; however this produces spatially incoherent flickering animations due to the fact that small changes in the vector field at adjacent time steps can lead to large changes in streamline trajectory. Path lines trace the trajectories of massless particles in unsteady flows. These particle traces are Galilean invariant <ref type="bibr" coords="3,474.66,524.66,15.03,9.96" target="#b24">[26] </ref>and they form the basis for many other unsteady flow visualization constructs. For example, streak lines are generated by connecting a series of particles that were released into the flow at consecutive time steps from the same seed point. Generalized streak lines <ref type="bibr" coords="3,392.89,574.64,10.50,9.96" target="#b1">[3] </ref>extend this concept by connecting all particles which were released at consecutive time steps from a point moving along a seed curve. Generalized streak lines are potentially more effective at visualizing data sets without inlet flows and data sets where the most important flow features move throughout the flow domain. The dragonfly data has both of these characteristics. A generalized streak line is illustrated at three time steps in the first row of images in <ref type="figure" coords="3,336.26,644.66,29.11,9.96" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. Swirling patterns in unsteady flows can be identified with streak lines; however they can be perceptually misleading. The swirling shape of a streak line that was in the vortex will remain present for several time steps if the vortex dissipates. This is illustrated in the first row of images in <ref type="figure" coords="3,352.85,694.64,27.24,9.96" target="#fig_2">figure 3</ref>. The data set used to generate this figure is a simulated flow around a single circular membranous disk. The disk undergoes a pitching and heaving motion. The disk center heaves in the -direction according to: 2073 KOEHLER ET AL: VORTEX VISUALIZATION IN ULTRA LOW REYNOLDS NUMBER INSECT FLIGHT </p><formula>() = = sin (2222) </formula><formula>(3) </formula><p>It pitches about its center according to: </p><formula>() = = cos (2222) (4) </formula><p>The heave and pitch amplitudes are and respectively, is the pitch-angle, is the flapping frequency and is time. The same formulas were used to generate the generalized streak line seed curve shown in <ref type="figure" coords="4,57.94,592.22,27.05,9.96" target="#fig_2">figure 3</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Flowing Seed Points</head><p>Streak lines clearly lend themselves to smooth animation, while streamlines do not. However, streamlines proved more effective at capturing the formation of the leading edge vortex on the dragonfly's wings. Streak lines also suffer when there are flapping immersed boundaries in the flow due to the need for excessive stretching or tearing to prevent intersection as particles separate around the leading edges of the flapping foils. Thus, the purpose of the flowing seed point algorithm is to unify the benefits of each method while still achieving spatially coherent animations. Conceptually flowing seed points are similar to streak lines, except instead of connecting a series of particles emitted from the same point, a short streamline or streamlet is integrated in the instantaneous vector field at each particle emitted from the same point. As demonstrated by Helgeland and Elboth <ref type="bibr" coords="4,381.34,323.18,13.78,9.96" target="#b12">[14]</ref>, a shorter integration time for each streamline reduces the spatial incoherence problems streamlines have in unsteady flows. Typical streamlet integration times were 8 to 16 steps in each direction. This concept is illustrated in <ref type="figure" coords="4,497.05,353.18,30.33,9.96" target="#fig_3">figure 4</ref>and compared with a generalized streak line in <ref type="figure" coords="4,457.80,363.14,29.00,9.96" target="#fig_2">figure 3</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Seed Curve Generation</head><p>Seed point placement is another very challenging aspect of using integration-based flow line visualization with highly unsteady 3D flows. If seeding is too dense visualizations become very busy and suffer from self occlusion. On the other hand, it is more difficult to capture all features of interest with fewer seed points. The effectiveness of all the methods in the previous section relies on having good seed placement for both streamlines and particles. Seed placement has been addressed in the literature. Verma et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,289.80,555.14,15.00,9.96" target="#b41">[43] </ref>presented a non-iterative seeding strategy for placing streamline seeds near critical points in 2D steady flows. Ye. et al. used seeding templates in the vicinity of critical points to seed streamlines in 3D flows <ref type="bibr" coords="4,312.65,585.14,13.78,9.96" target="#b42">[44]</ref>. Yuan et al. used a similarity measure to grow streamlines from a dense set of potential seeds <ref type="bibr" coords="4,427.44,595.16,13.74,9.96" target="#b43">[45]</ref>. Li and Shen proposed an image-based method for streamline seeding in 3D vector fields <ref type="bibr" coords="4,527.36,605.18,13.77,9.96" target="#b44">[46]</ref>. Marchesin et al. used a combination of view dependent and streamline metrics for streamline seed placement in 3D flows <ref type="bibr" coords="4,473.26,625.16,13.77,9.96" target="#b45">[47]</ref>. Automatic seeding methods based on some vector field metric calculated at each grid point or based on measurements taken from densely seeded flow lines can be very slow when dealing with terascale or larger data sets due to IO. It is even more challenging to use such methods to define seed points that move over time because of the constraint that seeds should move gradually between time steps. Also, traditional interactive seed placement methods typically only allow users to place static seed points, curves and surfaces. Static seed points suffer in situations where there is no inlet flow and when there are immersed boundaries in the flow field. Our approach is different in that it uses the immersed boundaries in the flow (in this case the wings) in order to define moving seed points over time. We initially ignore the underlying vector field and assume that the objects moving in the flow are causing the most interesting flow phenomena. Seeds are bound near the surface of the immersed objects in order to capture the neighboring near-field flow features. Specifically, vertex normals at user selected points on objects in the flow domain are used to define the distance of the seed from an immersed boundary (<ref type="figure" coords="5,100.34,564.26,31.83,9.96" target="#fig_4">Figure 5a</ref>). In order to use vertex normal seeds effectively, a user must be able to quickly identify surface points in the areas where seeds are desired. To accomplish this, several 3D polygon modeling operations were incorporated into the software. In particular, edge loop selection and surface patch selection are used to define where on the wings seeds should be placed. Subdivision refinement controls the seed density and the mouse scroll wheel controls how far in the normal direction the seeds are placed. As seed points are defined at one time step, the seed curves are automatically displayed. Seed curves are obtained by connecting points at neighboring time steps that are the same distance in the normal direction off the same point on the wing mesh. Scalar quantities of the underlying vector field, such as velocity, vorticity or are then mapped to the color of each seed curve. This allows the user to interactively evaluate whether a seed curve will capture an interesting portion of the flow at enough time steps before computing any flow lines. This is shown in figure 5b and 5c. This seed point placement method has the following advantages over seeding methods that use vector field metrics as well as traditional interactive methods such as static rakes near an inlet flow: @BULLET Speed of seed placement is unaffected by vector field size @BULLET Intuitive interactive seed curve creation and evaluation @BULLET Improved temporal and spatial coherency in animations </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">VISUALIZATIONS</head><p>This section presents the results of using the aforementioned visualization methods to study air flow around the reconstructed dragonfly wings. The flow phenomena is very similar on both sides of the insect, so certain methods were applied only to wings on the same side in order to reduce occlusion and information overload. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Vortex Detection</head><p>The vortex region detection algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="5,454.03,652.28,15.00,9.96" target="#b26">[28] </ref>and the Eigenvector method for core line extraction <ref type="bibr" coords="5,412.03,662.24,15.01,9.96" target="#b21">[23] </ref>were applied to the dragonfly data. Both methods proved effective at capturing the existence of the LEV (<ref type="figure" coords="5,313.75,682.28,32.71,9.96" target="#fig_5">figure 6a</ref>and 6c). In general vortex core and region detection algorithms performed better in the early time steps, before a complex wake structure had time to form (<ref type="figure" coords="5,418.13,702.26,31.44,9.96" target="#fig_5">figure 6a</ref>). At the later time steps core line detection suffered from scale dependence issues where the strong LEV was lost in the cores of all the weak vortices interacting in the downwash (<ref type="figure" coords="5,348.61,732.26,33.09,9.96" target="#fig_5">figure 6b</ref>and 6e). Choosing an appropriate threshold value for also proved challenging because different values were needed for different wings and different portions of the stroke. Also, while these methods were able to detect the LEV they provided little insight into why it remains attached to the wings. For these reasons, we chose to complement the vortex detection methods with a series of integration-based methods. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Particles</head><p>Particle advection was tested on the dragonfly data set with varying particle lifetimes and emission rates. Particle emission seeds were bound slightly off the leading edges normal to the wing. Rendering animated particles proved more effective than visualizing the corresponding static path lines due to the fact that they typically intersect the wings. Color was assigned based on which wing is driving the particle emission seeds (<ref type="figure" coords="6,153.41,529.34,28.21,9.96">Figure 7</ref>). Particles are, for the most part, only being shed off the wing tips when vortices are attached during up-stroke and down-stroke (<ref type="figure" coords="6,254.87,549.38,22.72,9.96;6,22.86,559.34,6.87,9.96">Figure  7a</ref>). Experiments show that vortex shedding can be visually identified using particles by the swirling motions in the flow at stroke reversal (<ref type="figure" coords="6,26.65,579.38,58.72,9.96">Figure 7c and 7d</ref>). However, the drawback of using particles is that it is difficult to identify the tight vortices when they are attached to each wing. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Streamlines</head><p>Streamlines were also tested on the dragonfly data set using vertex normal seeds. We used a fairly dense seeding along the leading edge of each wing so that integration time could be reduced while maintaining good streamline coverage of the entire LEV. The shorter integration time helps reduce flickering as the seed points gradually move in space and time. When animated it is easy to see exactly when in time the LEV on each wing forms due to the easily identifiable helix shape of the streamlines. This is illustrated in <ref type="figure" coords="6,213.65,701.36,28.88,9.96" target="#fig_6">figure 8</ref>at a time step when all four wings are performing an up-stroke. One drawback to using streamlines for visualizing near-field vortex formation in flapping wing insect flight is that it is hard to capture where the vortices go when they are shed at stroke reversal. The seeds are locked a set distance off the leading edges. If the LEV is shed out into the flow, the streamlines will not follow it like particles advected over time would. Thus, we are unable to use streamline visualization alone to look for wake capture. Closed streamlines can be used to visualize patterns of recirculation in the instantaneous vector fields of unsteady flows. Semi-transparent streamlines with very long integration times were used to identify closed streamlines in the 3D flows because they become darker in areas where the streamlines repeat themselves. Visual evidence of closed streamlines in the vicinity of a leading edge vortex is shown in <ref type="figure" coords="6,360.75,497.36,27.74,9.96" target="#fig_7">figure 9</ref>. The wings were kept semi-transparent in this example in order to reduce occlusion. When viewing streamline visualizations of this data set, it is important to note that the wings are represented as membranous objects in the CFD solver. Thus, there are no zero vectors marking their insides in the output. As a wing flaps, if the flow near its surface on both sides is moving in the same direction, then the streamlines will intersect it. This is an artifact of using streamlines on unsteady flow datasets with moving membranous immersed boundaries; however it does not make them less useful as long as users are mindful of the cause. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Flowing Seed Points</head><p>Flowing seeds were also applied to visualize the dragonfly data. The goal of using the flowing seed point method with this data set is to identify if there is any interaction between the flapping wings and previously shed vortices in the flow domain. For this reason, streamlets corresponding to the same wing were given the same color. The emission rate, particle lifetime and integration time of each streamlet were experimentally determined. Initial tests produced mixed results. At certain viewing angles it was difficult to discern anything that the particle animations did not already tell us. However, at other angles we could clearly track the vortices as they were shed off the leading edge of each wing. This is <ref type="figure" coords="6,27.06,173.26,19.25,8.91">Fig. 7</ref>. Particles continuously emitted near the leading edges of the right pair of wings. Blue particles correspond to the forewing and yellow particles correspond to the hindwing. Particles are mainly being shed from the wing tip during the up-stroke. Also, vortex shedding is very apparent during stroke reversal, however it is difficult to identify individual vortices with this visualization method. <ref type="figure" coords="6,363.42,342.28,23.66,8.91">Fig. 10</ref>. Cameras bound to the dragonfly wings such that they are looking down the core of the LEV at each time step. due to the fact that the vortices are moving in a curved figure-eight pattern during each wing beat. In order to fully utilize the benefits of flowing seed points with streamlets it became clear that the viewing angle needed to evolve as the wings flapped. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Wing Bound Cameras</head><p>Our solution is similar to the seed curve placement method in that the immersed wing and body objects are used to drive camera motion. At each time step, a vector from the root to the tip of each wing is saved. Cameras are then placed a user defined distance off the wing tip in the direction of this vector. Camera focal points are fixed at the corresponding wing root. Thus, the view direction of each camera is approximately parallel to the corresponding LEV at all times. Seed curves are then placed densely in the chord direction, instantaneously perpendicular to the viewing angle. Camera alignment is illustrated in <ref type="figure" coords="7,22.50,624.20,32.10,9.96">figure 10</ref>, and the flowing seed point results in figures 1, 11, 12 and 13 utilize wing bound cameras. <ref type="figure" coords="7,34.74,644.24,32.26,9.96">Figure 1</ref>uses flowing seeds and a camera mounted to the left forewing to capture the formation and movement of the LEV at four time steps during a down-stroke. Also, vortex shedding was observed at several down-stroke to up-stroke reversals. <ref type="figure" coords="7,203.12,674.24,37.26,9.96" target="#fig_8">Figure 11</ref>gives an example of this happening with the right forewing. This visualization includes the particles where each streamlet is seeded. It is clear that the vortex would be indiscernible with particles alone. Flowing seed points were used to investigate spanwise flow in the LEV. It has been theorized that spanwise flow allows energy to drain out of the LEV, which in turn allows it to remain stable and attached to the 3D wing unlike in the 2D case. The streamlets help identify the vortex while the particle advection captures the flow moving in the spanwise direction. This is illustrated in <ref type="figure" coords="7,438.23,456.98,31.69,9.96" target="#fig_1">figure 12</ref>. Comparisons were made with vortex core detection to validate the accuracy of the observed vortices and also to illustrate how the spanwise flow along the vortex cannot be identified through the vortex cores alone. Flowing seed points also captured visual evidence of wake capture between pairs of wings. Vortices are the main source of lift in ultra low Reynolds number insect flight. When the leading edge vortex is shed from a wing, the lift being generated by that wing drops. However, when the vortex is shed from the forewing during the upstroke to down-stroke reversal, some of its energy appears to be getting recaptured by the hindwing which has already started its down-stroke. Tests need to be done with more specimens and flight modes to say definitively if this is an unsteady lift mechanism unique to the dragonfly, but the visualizations allowed us to identify the possibility. This phenomenon is illustrated in <ref type="figure" coords="7,477.32,596.96,35.06,9.96" target="#fig_2">figure 13</ref>. Green particles are being injected into the LEV on the forewing and they are clearly entering the LEV of the hindwing soon after being shed. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Galilean Invariance and Streamlines</head><p>Streamlines have proven useful for manually <ref type="bibr" coords="7,488.68,648.98,14.26,9.96" target="#b21">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,511.04,648.98,12.00,9.96" target="#b22"> 24] </ref>and automatically <ref type="bibr" coords="7,342.23,658.94,14.96,9.96" target="#b25">[27] </ref>identifying vortices.

We observed that in the case of strong vortices like the LEV, non-Galilean invariant visualization methods such as streamlines and the Eigenvector method for vortex core detection produce results similar to the Galilean invariant -criterion. However, these methods produce slightly different results near the wing tips where the vortices are moving fastest and shedding from the wings. This is illustrated in <ref type="figure" coords="8,127.18,385.16,32.06,9.96" target="#fig_3">figure 14</ref>. Also, we observed differences between these methods when applied to the induced flow, as can be seen in <ref type="figure" coords="8,50.40,405.14,30.90,9.96" target="#fig_5">figure 6e</ref>. The flowing seed point method partially addresses the limitations streamlines have due to being non-Galiliean invariant by combining them with particle trajectories that are traced in time. More research is needed to quantify the impact vortex strength and velocity have on streamlines seeded varying distances from vortex cores. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DOMAIN EXPERT REVIEW</head><p>In order to gain further insight into the vortex behaviour that we have visualized up to this point, comparisons were made between the visualizations and plots of lift production over time. Peaks and valleys in the lift were identified and visualizations were created at the surrounding time steps in order to make the critical link between vortex formation, attachment and shedding and the resulting force (<ref type="figure" coords="8,26.37,551.18,31.44,9.96" target="#fig_4">figure 15</ref>). In this figure, the vector fields corresponding to a sharp drop in lift on the left forewing are examined with flowing seed points. The wing is in a down-stroke to up-stroke reversal and the previous LEV is beginning to shed under the wing and out into the flow in front of the dragonfly. As the wing becomes approximately vertical at time 0.018 the lift coefficient is near zero. The ensuing valley in lift production occurs when the shed LEV moves under the wing before the new LEV has formed. This makes sense with our predictions of how the vortices would be behaving when lift drops. In practice similar comparisons would be made between lift coefficient and all of the visualization methods presented in this paper. We take great satisfaction in the fact that these methods are being adopted by the Wright State University Flow Simulation Research Group for further analysis of different dragonfly flying modes. We hope to use these methods to identify new unsteady lift generation mechanisms in flapping flight and to gain insight into the role of wing deformation in vortex production. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>Clearly insect flight is a very important and challenging application domain for applied flow visualization. Multiple dynamically deforming flapping wings create extremely unsteady flows and it is difficult to predict the effectiveness of any given visualization technique. We addressed this problem by combining vortex core and region detection methods with a series of integration-based methods. The flowing seed point method was introduced to combine the benefits of streamlines and streak lines in order to visualize vortex shedding, spanwise flow and wake capture between wings. This method also helps clarify some perceptual issues that occur when using streak lines to visualize flapping flight data. We introduced an interactive seed curve generation method that takes advantage of the presence of the flapping wings to greatly simplify seed placement. Also, a camera animation method was demonstrated to keep the focus on the leading edge vortices as they move throughout the flow domain. In the future we plan to extend this work by utilizing a wider range of cutting edge flow visualization techniques and by applying them to a wider array of flapping flight simulations. and H.
