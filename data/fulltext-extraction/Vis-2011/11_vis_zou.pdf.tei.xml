			<abstract>
				<p>—Parameterization of complex surfaces constitutes a major means of visualizing highly convoluted geometric structures as well as other properties associated with the surface. It also enables users with the ability to navigate, orient, and focus on regions of interest within a global view and overcome the occlusions to inner concavities. In this paper, we propose a novel area-preserving surface parameterization method which is rigorous in theory, moderate in computation, yet easily extendable to surfaces of non-disc and closed-boundary topologies. Starting from the distortion induced by an initial parameterization, an area restoring diffeomorphic flow is constructed as a Lie advection of differential 2-forms along the manifold, which yields equality of the area elements between the domain and the original surface at its final state. Existence and uniqueness of result are assured through an analytical derivation. Based upon a triangulated surface representation, we also present an efficient algorithm in line with discrete differential modeling. As an exemplar application, the utilization of this method for the effective visualization of brain cortical imaging modalities is presented. Compared with conformal methods, our method can reveal more subtle surface patterns in a quantitative manner. It, therefore, provides a competitive alternative to the existing parameterization techniques for better surface-based analysis in various scenarios.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Surface parameterization refers to the process of mapping a surface into a canonical domain, which permits many surface operations to be performed in the parametric domain with improved efficiency and feasibility. It is of utmost importance in a broad range of graphics and visualization applications, such as texture mapping <ref type="bibr" coords="1,233.32,323.85,13.74,10.17" target="#b23">[24]</ref> , remesh- ing <ref type="bibr" coords="1,45.20,333.81,13.75,10.17" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, 3D shape analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="1,131.62,333.81,14.94,10.17" target="#b17">[18] </ref>and surface visualization <ref type="bibr" coords="1,240.11,333.81,13.75,10.17" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. To date, most parameterization techniques fall into two categories, namely, functional methods <ref type="bibr" coords="1,134.34,354.34,14.19,10.17" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,151.17,354.34,11.21,10.17" target="#b29"> 30,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,165.03,354.34,11.95,10.17" target="#b33"> 34] </ref>and conformal methods <ref type="bibr" coords="1,267.73,354.34,14.19,10.17" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,31.50,364.30,11.21,10.17" target="#b23"> 24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,45.66,364.30,11.21,10.17" target="#b13"> 14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,59.82,364.30,10.65,10.17" target="#b21"> 22]</ref>. Functional methods typically start with defining certain penalty functions, such that the minima are assumed at desired results . Parameterization is then achieved using optimization methods. Although these methods are fairly flexible in terms of customizability to the properties to be preserved, in most cases, this approach can be problematic as the flattening is non-deterministic, relying on a set of tuning parameters and halting criteria. In general, no quantities are exactly preserved by the methods of this type. In contrast to those methods, conformal methods, on the other hand, possess several unique advantages, e.g., exact angle preserving, guarantee of solution existence, efficient implementations, and a rich continuous theory in parallel. However, a significant issue of conformal parameterization is that, especially when dealing with extruding shapes, the areal elements can be severely compressed for the price of preserving angular structure . Although it is known that additional surface cuts, along with cone singularities, can be introduced to the surface to effectively reduce the distortion of final results <ref type="bibr" coords="1,123.73,523.71,14.19,10.17" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,140.68,523.71,6.72,10.17" target="#b4"> 5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,150.16,523.71,10.65,10.17" target="#b30"> 31]</ref>, such practice is ad hoc and can give rise to complications when data needs be accessed across the cut paths <ref type="bibr" coords="1,52.67,543.63,13.75,10.17" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Despite a substantial literature devoted to surface and mesh parameterization , its area-preserving aspect has not been adequately studied or applied in this field. In many applications, such as quantitative analyses and visualization of in vivo brain surfaces <ref type="bibr" coords="1,224.50,584.09,13.74,10.17" target="#b36">[37]</ref> , it is highly desirable that the fattened map, namely the parametric domain, can preserve area elements of the original brain surface, so that many arearelated patterns derived from a rich line of multimodal information,  e.g., neuronal density, activation extent, thickness, etc., can be accurately represented in this analytical space. Even though the distortion induced by parameterization procedures is notoriously undesired, it is well known that, in general, a surface cannot be flattened without any kinds of distortion in the presence of Gaussian curvature. For instance, conformal mapping can preserve local surface geometry by preserving angles no matter what conformal parameterization is chosen, however , the area stretching increases exponentially at the tip of protruding shapes. In <ref type="bibr" coords="1,314.31,373.78,9.52,10.17" target="#b6">[7]</ref> , Desbrun et al. showed that, based on a few desirable properties such as rotation and translation invariance, the only admissible parameterizations form a two-dimensional space spanned by the wellstudied conformal parameterization and an area-preserving counterpart , namely, the authalic parameterization. They also explicitly stated that their formulation of discrete authalic parameterization was only a local minimum of a quadratic energy without known definition in differential geometry. Along this direction, there is no any existing technique which is rigorously area-preserving and meanwhile can be generalized to arbitrary surfaces. Prior area-preserving parameterizations typically strive for the local minima of certain objective functionals , which lack provable guarantee of area preservation. In contrast, this paper presents a practical method to compute a group of global rigorous area-preserving parameterizations, which is mathematically rigorous and allows for an efficient implementation. Our method formulates the process of area restoration from an initial parameterization of arbitrary 2-manifolds using Lie advection, a frequently appearing concept in classical mechanics. To our best knowledge , this is the first work that employs Lie advection as a tool to manipulate area changes in the context of surface parameterization, which accommodates a wide range of boundary condition options. Besides a general framework, this work also features an efficient, yet accurate discretization scheme that is motivated by preserving the original geometric and algebraic structures of the continuous model in the limit, hence rendering better numerical fidelity and algorithmic scalability. A similar idea was mathematically sketched in <ref type="bibr" coords="1,478.15,624.76,10.45,10.17" target="#b2">[3] </ref>and backed by a general result from <ref type="bibr" coords="1,375.64,634.72,14.94,10.17" target="#b26">[27] </ref> that guarantees the existence of an areapreserving diffeomorphism between two surfaces with the same total surface area. However, the discussion was restricted to a spherical domain . In this case, our mathematical derivation arrives at the same solution as <ref type="bibr" coords="1,336.41,674.57,9.52,10.17" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Based on the Monge-Kantorovich theory of optimal mass transport, Haker et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,396.83,684.54,14.94,10.17" target="#b14">[15] </ref>developed an image registration and warping technique. Lying at the core is a decomposition of the deformation into a divergence-free vector field plus a curl-free one, called the polar factorization. A mass (e.g., area/volume) preserving mapping was explicitly sought in R n by a gradient descent method to the Monge-Kantorovich functional. Their method has been used for area-preserving corrections on top of conformally flattened vessel surfaces in R 2 , implemented on a regular Cartesian grid <ref type="bibr" coords="2,202.91,61.27,13.74,10.17" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Recently, the technique of optimal mass transport has also been applied to texture mapping of closed genus zero surfaces <ref type="bibr" coords="2,168.37,81.20,9.52,10.17" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. However, it is not clear how these methods can be extended to a general manifold. As a matter of fact, our analytical derivation as well as the implementation presented in this paper admits exact control of the finite areal dilation and shrinkage for the surface over the entire domain. Authalic parameterization is only a special case within a more versatile framework. Furthermore, our method can be readily generalized to compute the authalic mapping between two general manifolds equipped with nontrivial metrics, as the foundation of the system is formulated in Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC). In summary, our proposed parameterization method has a number of prominent features, enumerated as follows: By introducing Lie advection to surface parameterization, the evolution of area elements can be precisely quantified by the Lie derivative. Computing an area-preserving parameterization is therefore equivalent to deriving a time-dependent vector field that corrects area distortions, i.e., dilation/shrinkage induced by an initial parameterization, through a diffeomorphic flow. Our formulation is systematically based on the exterior calculus of differential forms . Thus, differential and integral equations can be conveniently expressed on smooth and curved spaces in a consistent manner. As our method is deeply-rooted to the intrinsic geometry of 2- manifolds, performing this procedure on non-flat domains, e.g., a unit sphere, is straightforward. </p></div>

This merit is largely inherited from the state-of-the-art conformal parameterization techniques <ref type="bibr" coords="2,106.19,396.00,14.20,10.17" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,122.14,396.00,10.65,10.17" target="#b21"> 22]</ref>. Given the initial parameterization, the subsequent evolution of the area elements essentially comprises an automorphism over the domain. The topological structure of the given parameterization remains intact. @BULLET Computationally affordable. In general, the cost depends on the size of the mesh times the number of discretized steps needed for the desired accuracy. A satisfactory authalic parameterization can be usually obtained through solving a limited number of sparse, linear systems. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related work. The analytical foundation of our method is presented in Section 3. After that, we proceed to the technical details on the discrete algorithm in Section 4. The performance assessment as well as a demonstrative application to the surface-based multimodality analytics of brain imaging data is given in Section 5. Finally, in Section 6, we summarize our work and conclude with a discussion about the limitation, possible improvements as well as a few potential future directions of this method. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Reducing area distortion of surface/mesh parametrization has been of major interest in the main geometry processing field. To prevent severe geometric stretches, on the one hand, the original model is typically decomposed into a set of charts homeomorphic to a disc in such a way that the interior Gaussian curvature is close to zero <ref type="bibr" coords="2,213.23,654.64,14.20,10.17" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,230.39,654.64,11.21,10.17" target="#b28"> 29,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,244.55,654.64,11.21,10.17" target="#b29"> 30,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,258.71,654.64,10.65,10.17" target="#b33"> 34]</ref>, while on the other hand, various uniformity metrics have been applied to surface parameterizations to encourage even distribution of intrinsic distortions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,96.89,684.53,14.19,10.17" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,114.65,684.53,11.21,10.17" target="#b29"> 30,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,129.43,684.53,11.21,10.17" target="#b20"> 21,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,144.21,684.53,10.65,10.17" target="#b33"> 34]</ref>. Based on the singular values of the Jacobian matrix, Sander et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,162.48,694.49,14.94,10.17" target="#b27">[28] </ref>optimized the parametric location of each vertex within its 1-ring neighborhood to reduce local stretches. Sorkine et al.'s bounded-distortion paramterization <ref type="bibr" coords="2,257.97,714.42,14.94,10.17" target="#b29">[30] </ref>made heavy use of mesh cuts to keep distortions below some preset threshold. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,105.31,734.34,14.94,10.17" target="#b33">[34] </ref>identified an anisotropic stretch term from a 2 × 2 tensor metric closely related to the one derived in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,504.29,51.30,14.94,10.17" target="#b27">[28] </ref>and applied it to guide the vertex optimization. Even though their distortion metric contains an area-preserving energy term, they did not mention whether an absolute area-preserving patch parameterization can be practically achieved. Desbrun et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,447.83,91.16,10.45,10.17" target="#b6">[7] </ref>also emphasized the importance of minimizing area distortion for the intrinsic parameterization of triangle meshes. In their work, an intuitive area-preserving functional was devised. Since the functional tried to preserve the area structure of the original 1-ring, the optimal parameterization derived was termed " Discrete Authalic Parameterization (DAP) " . Due to the fact that the parameterization is only a critical point to the functional , it cannot exactly preserve areas across the mesh. Jin et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,520.60,160.90,14.94,10.17" target="#b20">[21] </ref>proposed to search for the optimal global conformal parameterization in the space of Möbius transformations. As conformality is invariant through Möbius transformations, the resulting parameterization is still conformal, which cannot completely eliminate area distortions. Based on the fact that surface parameterization is closely related to the topological constraints, delicate topological modifications can sometimes improve the uniformity of the parameterization. Towards this end, Gu and Yau punctured small holes at the tip of long appendages in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,518.09,240.60,13.94,10.17" target="#b12">[13]</ref>; Cone singularities were introduced with non-vanishing Gaussian curvature in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,319.96,260.52,14.19,10.17" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,337.00,260.52,6.64,10.17" target="#b4"> 5]</ref>; Surface cuts were repeatedly augmented according to the geometric stretches generated through the course of tentative parameterizations in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,361.58,280.45,13.74,10.17" target="#b10">[11]</ref> . Although such schemes provide excellent remedies to some applications, they are generally not acceptable to the rest. In terms of area preservation, these methods can be considered as heuristic approaches. Rigorous authalic parameterization is in general not achievable along this direction. The analytical derivation of our method is consistently based on the differential forms on the manifold. Exterior calculus of differential forms has become a powerful tool in geometry processing for its clear revelation of the underlying geometric structures along with a well shaped mathematical foundation. In fact, most differential equation systems can be concisely formulated in the notion of differential forms. Holomorphic 1-forms were used for global conformal parameterization of nonzero genus surfaces in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,432.24,400.49,13.74,10.17" target="#b12">[13]</ref> . As this method is conformal , it potentially creates large area distortion, even after optimiza- tion <ref type="bibr" coords="2,300.97,420.42,13.75,10.17" target="#b20">[21]</ref> . The theoretical background concerned with several celebrated topological and geometric theorems, e.g., the Poincaré-Hopf index theorem and the Tutte's spring embedding theorem, was generalized in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,294.85,450.31,13.74,10.17" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, based on the formalism of discrete 1-forms. Tong et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,520.57,450.31,14.94,10.17" target="#b31">[32] </ref>utilized harmonic 1-forms for surface quadrangulation and extended the discrete Laplacian operator to allow for a set of flexible meshing controls. Fisher et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,367.48,480.19,10.45,10.17" target="#b8">[9] </ref>demonstrated an interactive tangent vector field design system over arbitrary surface meshes, based on discrete 1-forms and the corresponding Laplacian operator. Recently, He et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,296.66,510.08,14.94,10.17" target="#b15">[16] </ref> applied harmonic 1-forms to skeleton extraction of 3D models . Because of its intrinsic nature, the system was demonstrated to be robust and can be generalized to different surface representations. While these works made extensive use of 0-forms and 1-forms, the computational primitive of our framework is 2-forms, which can be regarded as infinitesimal area elements on the manifold. Our application of differential forms is to quantify infinitesimal area changes of surfaces via a diffeomorphic flow formulated as a Lie advection. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">MATHEMATICAL THEORY</head><p> This section presents the analytical basis that leads to a family of rigorous authalic surface parameterizations. We refer interested readers to the appendix for the related concepts on diffeomorphism and differential forms. Starting with an initial parameterization between a surface and its targeting domain, which requires to be a diffeomorphism (most modern parameterization methods <ref type="bibr" coords="2,394.40,674.57,14.19,10.17" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,410.98,674.57,11.21,10.17" target="#b23"> 24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,424.57,674.57,11.95,10.17" target="#b30"> 31] </ref>meet this requirement), we can homotopically deform it to an area-preserving one. Suppose M and Ω are the surface and desired domain to be parameterized upon, respectively. M and Ω are two differentiable 2-manifolds associated by a diffeomorphism f : M → Ω. The infinitesimal area elements of a surface can be mathematically depicted as differential 2-forms. Let ω i , i = M, Ω be the area form of M and Ω, respectively. The pullback of ω Ω under f is a differential 2-form on M, denoted as f * (ω Ω ). We assume that M and Ω have the same area integral after a proper scaling, that is, </p><formula>M ω M = Ω ω Ω . </formula><formula>(1) </formula><p>Computing an area-preserving map μ : M → Ω now is equivalent to finding a diffeomorphism ϕ : </p><formula>M → M, such that ϕ * (ω M ) = f * (ω Ω ). </formula><p>Consequently, μ is given by f @BULLET ϕ −1 . To accomplish this, we first linearly interpolate a 2-form over time: </p><formula>ω t = (1 − t)ω M + t f * (ω Ω ), t ∈ [0, 1]. </formula><formula>(2) </formula><p>Note that ω </p><formula>0 = ω M and ω 1 = f * (ω Ω ). </formula><p>In the following, we will design a one parameter family of diffeomorphisms, such that the corresponding flow deforms the area element in the same fashion as ω t . More specifically, consider a smooth surface M with a smooth vector field V on it. Given any point p ∈ M, there exists a unique integral curve γ(t) of V passing through it, such that dγ p (t) </p><formula>dt = V (γ p (t)), γ p (0) = p. </formula><formula>(3) </formula><p> An one-parameter family of diffeomorphisms (which are also automorphisms ) φ t , parametrized by t ∈ [0, 1], can be defined on M as </p><formula>φ t (p) = γ p (t). </formula><formula>(4) </formula><p>Here we need φ * t (ω 0 ) = ω t . Computing the time derivative at t = 0 on both sides, we get </p><formula>dφ * t ω dt t=0 = f * (ω Ω ) − ω M , </formula><formula>(5) </formula><p>which, by definition, is the Lie derivative of ω t with respect to V . Hence, the central equation to solve is </p><formula>L V (t) ω t = f * (ω Ω ) − ω M , </formula><formula>(6) </formula><p> where L V (t) denotes the Lie derivative with respect to V (t). By using Cartan's formula </p><formula>L V = d(i V ) + i V d, </formula><p>where i V denotes the interior product with respect to V (t) and d the exterior derivative, we have </p><formula>d(i V ω t ) + i V dω t = f * (ω Ω ) − ω M . </formula><formula>(7) </formula><p>Because ω t is a 2-form on M, dω t = 0. We therefore have </p><formula>d(i V ω t ) = f * (ω Ω ) − ω M . </formula><formula>(8) </formula><p>Suppose h M and h Ω are two scaling factors (0-forms), such that </p><formula>ω M = h M du ∧ dv and f * (ω Ω ) = h Ω du ∧ dv. </formula><p>Eq. 8 can be solved as </p><formula>V (t) = 1 (1 − t)h M + th Ω ∇g, (9) </formula><p>where </p><formula>Δg = h Ω − h M , </formula><formula>(10) </formula><p>and Δ denotes the Laplacian-Beltrami differential operator. Note that, the above derivation only holds at t = 0. As system evolves over time, V (t) varies in both magnitude and direction. Thus V (t) needs to be solved at each time. Since g is essentially a harmonic scalar field on M (see Eq. (10)), the corresponding gradient vector field ∇g is guaranteed to be sufficiently smooth for integration and free of extraneous critical points. Time integration of V (t) therefore yields a diffeomorphism . Note that pre-assignment of h M essentially provides a straightforward mechanism to control infinitesimal area variation from the surface to the parameter domain. For an area-preserving mapping, h M = 1. The following discussion sticks to this case. Finally, the proposed authalic parameterization is given by f @BULLET φ −1 t=1 : M → Ω. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">ALGORITHM</head><p>Now we discuss the discretization and algorithm corresponding to the theoretical result presented above. Most major mathematical concepts have existing conventional discrete forms <ref type="bibr" coords="3,469.92,85.12,13.74,10.17" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, thus yielding a consistent computational framework which can be readily carried out in practice. More sophisticated discretization schemes can be interchangeably employed within the framework for the enhanced numerical approximation, which could be critical in certain extreme circum- stances <ref type="bibr" coords="3,322.26,134.94,9.52,10.17" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. We approximate a surface by a triangular mesh Σ = (V, E, F), where V = {v i } denotes the set of vertices, E = {e i j } the edge set, and F = { f i jk } the face set with 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ n = |V |. The position of vertex v i is denoted by v i ∈ R 3 and the edge vector corresponding to e i j , which connects v i to v j , is e i j = v j − v i . The 1-ring neighbors of v i are denoted as N 1 (i). All triangular faces assume counterclockwise orientation. Our algorithm is directly developed upon the structure of the original mesh. For each vertex, the associated surface patch is chosen to be the barycentric finite volume, whose piecewise linear boundary connects the midpoints of the incident edges to the barycenters of adjacent triangles. Such finite volume configuration tiles the surface perfectly without overlap, i.e., each point on the surface is covered once and only once, and is insensitive to obtuse triangulations. Its value can be simply computed as </p><formula>A i = 1 6 ∑ f i jk ∈N 1 (i) |e i j × e ik |. </formula><formula>(11) </formula><p>Geometric properties are averaged within the patch and retained at the center vertex. Our algorithm runs in two successive stages, which are illustrated in <ref type="figure" coords="3,342.15,361.80,21.29,10.17" target="#fig_3">Fig. 1</ref>using the brain hemisphere surface model. In the following, we describe each essential step of the algorithm in the order it occurs in the pipeline. (b) give the lateral and the mesial views of a cortical hemisphere, respectively, which is provided for an authalic parameterization.

On the other hand, since our method can be performed upon any initial mapping, a wide range of surface parameterization methods are possible for the initial step in order to achieve particular functionalities relevant to the applications.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Solving Δg</head><formula>= h Ω − h M </formula><p>For the purpose of area-preserving parameterization, h M is always 1, whereas h Ω is the per-vertex model/parameter area ratio at play. In accordance with Eq. (1), h Ω is subject to a further normalization, such that the integral of h Ω is equal to the total area of the domain. Given a function f on the surface, its discrete version is a vector g, defined on the vertex set V . To solve Eq. (10) on a triangular mesh, the discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator is linearly approximated at each vertex. Therefore, Δg is estimated at v i as </p><formula>Δg(v i ) = 1 A i ∑ j∈N 1 (i) cot α i j + cot β i j 2 [g(v j ) − g(v i )], </formula><formula>(12) </formula><p> where α i j and β i j are the two angles opposite to the edge e i j , respectively . When considering all vertices of a mesh, Eq. (12) can be written as a linear system: </p><formula>Lx = b, </formula><formula>(13) </formula><p>where x = g and b = h Ω − h M .

For this reason, Eq. (13) can be solved efficiently in linear time, e.g., using the preconditioned bi-conjugate gradient method. In practice, we have observed that solving the normal equations L T Lx = L T b yields more robust numerical behavior than directly solving Eq. (13). <ref type="figure" coords="4,370.83,528.13,30.88,10.17" target="#fig_3">Fig. 1(e)</ref>shows the solved function g. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Computing ∇g</head><p>After the g is obtained, we can proceed to compute the corresponding gradient vector field on the triangulated domain. We consider a face f i jk with its three corners lying at v i , v j , v k in R 3 . Also, let n be a unit normal vector perpendicular to the plane spanned by f i jk . Assuming linear interpolation within each triangle, the gradient vector can be easily computed by solving a 3 × 3 linear system: </p><formula>⎡ ⎣ v j − v i v k − v j n ⎤ ⎦ ∇g = ⎡ ⎣ g j − g i g k − g j 0 ⎤ ⎦ , </formula><formula>(15) </formula><p>for which an analytic solution exists.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Time Integration of V (t)</head><p>Recall that the Lie derivative is defined as the instantaneous change of forms evaluated at φ t (x), which is a dynamic definition (See Eq. (5)). Besides time t, V (t) also depends on ∇g, which is in turn determined by the current vertex positions. For this reason, V (t) needs to be updated at each step. Standard pathline computation is thus not applicable for the integration of V (t). Instead, it is worth noticing that Eq. (9) can be analytically integrated as </p><formula>1 0 V (t)dt = ln h Ω − ln h M h Ω − h M ∇g. </formula><formula>(17) </formula><p>In particular, when h M = 1, we have lim </p><formula>h Ω →1 ln h Ω − ln h M h Ω − h M = 1, </formula><formula>(18) </formula><p>which means that, when h Ω is sufficiently close to 1, the displacement vector field can be properly approximated by ∇g. Our scheme is therefore motivated by keeping the analytical portion of the computation as far as possible. Specifically, we divide the area-correcting process into K sequential steps. At each step, the area element is only modified by an small amount δ h towards the target setting in such a way that the overall area adjustment is equal to Kδ h. For each area increment of δ h, we let h Ω = 1 + δ h and h M = 1 as the input of the analytical integration (<ref type="bibr" coords="5,62.66,323.40,26.79,10.17">Eq. (17)</ref>), and the result gives the corresponding displacement with a change of δ h in the area element as expected. To prevent the accumulation of numerical errors, in practice, we divide the remaining area excess into K − k + 1 equal allotments at step k and compute h Ω based on the current factual progress as </p><formula>h Ω = 1 + λ k − 1 K − k + 1 , k = 1,...,K, (19) </formula><p>where λ k is given by the current per-vertex surface/domain area ratio at the beginning of step k. Let V (v i , k) denote the velocity field defined on the vertex set V of mesh Σ, at step k and φ (v i , k) the induced mapping. By the one-parameter group structure of diffeomorphisms, φ (v i , k) is simply the sum of all induced displacements of v i plus the identity, written as </p><formula>φ (v i , k) = φ (v i , 0) + k ∑ i=1 ∇g i , </formula><formula>(20) </formula><p>where φ (v i , 0) denotes the initial parameterization of the original mesh, and ∇g i the gradient of function g solved at step i. Note that φ (V, K) gives the final discrete authalic map of mesh Σ at the end of the flow. The number of discrete steps is currently determined on a test-and-refine basis. In general, a larger number of iteration steps result in more accurate approximations. Empirically, discretizing this procedure into 50 steps can give satisfactory results for most mesh models. As our method essentially differs from an optimization framework , computation will not terminate until all the pre-determined steps have been completed. At the moment, boundary vertices are fixed. In the next section, we will show how this boundary condition can be relaxed .

The movement of vertices is in principle determined by the designated area changes. However, degenerate triangulation may undermine the discrete computation due to inaccurate approximation of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Before each step begins, we optimize the underlying triangulation by performing combinatorial flips to all flippable edges opposite to the straight angles. Note that, the geometry of surfaces is realized by their R 3 embedding. Throughout this procedure , the discrete sampling of the shape remains unchanged, but is merely interpolated by a different triangulation. </p></div>

The centers and the radii of the boundary circles are either determined by certain heuristics or by the geometries of the original surface. It is therefore natural to restrict the boundary vertices to the domain boundaries, while letting them slide with the flow for an authalic parameterization. This motion is in fact induced by the covariant derivative of V (t) in the tangential direction of domain boundary ∂ D. As a conventional practice, whenever the vertex moves away from its inhabited space, it is subject to a projection along the radial direction to bring it back to the track. <ref type="figure" coords="5,430.72,254.33,20.96,10.17" target="#fig_5">Fig. 2</ref>demonstrates an example of applying the circular boundary condition to parameterizing surface models homeomorphic to a disk. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.2">Sphere</head><p>Many surfaces in real life, such as the brain surface, are often modeled as a topological sphere, i.e., a closed surface of genus zero, thus is preferred to be parameterized on a unit sphere (S 2 ) without any topological changes. Our method can easily adapt to this case as well. To achieve an initial parameterization of the surface onto the sphere, we compute its conformal mapping using the method described in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,527.35,354.49,13.74,10.17" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The Lie advection flowing to the area preservation is then performed in the tangent spaces of such a spherical domain. To do so, we decompose the displacement vector field ∇g in each step into a normal component ∇ ⊥ g and a tangent component ∇ T g. Let n denote the normal field of S 2 . For each vertex v i , the normal component ∇ ⊥ g is computed as </p><formula>∇ ⊥ g(v i ) =&lt; ∇g, n &gt; v i n(v i ), </formula><formula>(21) </formula><p>where &lt; ·, · &gt; is a scalar field, with its pointwise value defined as the inner product of two vectors in R 3 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.3">Virtual Cuts</head><p>A recent advance in surface parameterization is represented by a string of conformal mapping techniques <ref type="bibr" coords="5,417.38,571.52,14.20,10.17" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,433.87,571.52,11.21,10.17" target="#b19"> 20,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,447.37,571.52,6.72,10.17" target="#b4"> 5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,456.39,571.52,11.95,10.17" target="#b30"> 31] </ref> that allow global parameterizations of arbitrary surfaces via metric scaling within the class of conformal equivalence. For the final flat metric to be embedded over the Euclidean domain, a set of virtual cuts need to be introduced to the abstract manifold to open it to a topological disk. However, the parameterization remains global and continuous in that both sides along the cut can be perfectly adjoined under a rigid rotation and this property is independent of the placement of the cuts. The resulting parameterization is in fact a fundamental domain of the given surface, and the necessary cut paths can be determined by a homology basis. Now we demonstrate that an authalic counterpart sharing the same concept can be conveniently obtained in this framework. Suppose the " virtual " cut made to the original surface is specified as a subset ρ of edges in Σ. For each non-boundary edge e i j ∈ ρ, it is split into two mated boundary edges e + i j and e − i j . A vertex v i with n edges split in its 1-ring induces n equivalents {v k i }, k = 0,...,n − 1 in the resulting mesh. Given a pair of edge mates shows the Bimba model with 39994 triangles, which is a closed genus zero surface. Its spherical conformal parameterization is shown in (b). The corresponding authalic spherical parameterization is shown in (c). The statistics of the result is shown in (d). shows the Rocker Arm model with 40088 triangles, with genus one topology. The cut paths are delineated in red. Its conformal parameterization is shown in (b). The corresponding authalic spherical parameterization is shown in (c).

Whenever an operation is performed at v k i other than the vertices assigned with cone singularities, it is de facto treated as an ordinary vertex within the mesh. <ref type="figure" coords="6,351.38,644.78,21.71,10.17" target="#fig_9">Fig. 4</ref>demonstrates an example of parameterizing a genus one surface in the Euclidean 2D domain, in which the virtual cuts are incorporated after parameterization. Ideally, the shapes of the opposite boundaries should be identical by the nature of this treatment, which can be easily zippered back to the original model with continuity maintained across the cuts. Due to numerical errors induced in the computation of T and its subsequent application to the remote 1-ring pieces, those vertex equivalents fail to move consistently as time goes. As a result, the continuity of the original model across virtual cuts is impaired after the diffemorphic flow. We are actively seeking better treatment for the vertices along the cut boundaries, such that the continuity can be preserved. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Numerics</head><p>Since finite volume has been used to compute the area ratio h i , i = M, Ω, we can reasonably expect good areal preservation in terms of areas associated with vertices. To verify that the area element is preserved globally regardless of the triangulation, we instead build up our distortion measures on their dual cells–triangular faces. To be specific, we examine both the area distortion and the quasi-conformal distortion per face over the mesh. The area distortion metric ϒ and the quasiconformal distortion metric Λ are computed respectively as follows: </p><formula>ϒ = ln(γ max · γ min ), Λ = ln γ max γ min , </formula><formula>(23) </formula><p> where (γ max , γ min ) are the larger and smaller eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the affine transformation that maps the domain triangle to the surface, normalized in such a way that the total area of the surface equals that of the domain, as described in <ref type="bibr" coords="7,178.63,554.88,13.74,10.17" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. γ max and γ min represent the largest and smallest local stretches among all possible directions when mapping a non-zero vector from the domain to the surface. For a conformal parameterization, we need γ max = γ min (Λ = 0), while γ max · γ min = 1 (ϒ = 0) means area preservation. In both cases, a value of 0 indicates no distortion at all. A mapping is isometric, if and only if ϒ = Λ = 0. The advantages of using logarithmic values for the metrics include 1) the ideal (no distortion) is therefore unified to the axis origin (0); and 2) the bias between stretches along the two orthogonal eigen-directions is eliminated. The statistics of the area and the quasi-conformal distortions are given for all the examples, respectively. The X axis denotes the values of distortion metrics ϒ and Λ, while the reading of Y axis denotes the number of triangles that bear the corresponding distortion metrics. As shown by the dark red histograms, the distribution of ϒ is highly concentrated about zero, meaning that the area of triangles are well preserved throughout all the experiments. For general surfaces with non-trivial Gaussian curvature, it is in general impossible for a mapping to be both area-preserving and angle-preserving, i.e., isometric, as theoretically confirmed by the classical results from Riemannian geometry. Hence, area preservation will inevitably induce angle distortion , which in fact is expectable after application of the aforementioned parameterization procedure. For this reason, the distribution of Λ spans from 0 to 3 without any obvious patterns. However, as visually demonstrated by these examples, the induced angle distortion is not significant. From the experiments, we also notice that the severe distortion is concentrated at the boundary and spread very little inwards. This is because, while constrained by each particular boundary condition , boundary vertices cannot freely moves as directed by the area restoring flow (V (t)). Thus, the area manipulation is not fully enforced on the boundary. <ref type="figure" coords="7,304.09,288.59,26.93,10.17" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> summarizes the numerical results of our experimental implementation , which is indexed by the figure number (column 1) and includes information about mesh sizes (column 2), the number of discretization steps (column 3), the computation times taken(column 4), and the methods used for the initial parameterization (column 5). The computation times only account for the procedure of authalic area correction based on the initial inputs. As we can see from <ref type="figure" coords="7,501.01,348.37,26.05,10.17" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, the computation times scale linearly in accordance with mesh sizes and the number of iterations. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Quantitative Surface-based Analytics</head><p>Although the presented method is applicable to general surfaces in principle, of particular interest to us are its applications to brain imaging modality visualization and analytics. Many neurological phenomena can be indicated by changes in the various brain imaging measurements . With a focus on the cerebral cortex, which plays a key role in many aspects of human intelligence and is profoundly associated with a variety of brain diseases and neurological disorders, we briefly introduce a visual analysis framework that is designed to integrate various complementing neuroimaging modalities from multiple sources, so that quantitative assessments from individual modalities can be formalized into a unified data structure to facilitate advanced data mining and visualization. In this application, surface parameterization (flattening) constitutes a major means of visualizing highly convoluted anatomical surfaces, allowing clear examination of many pathologies once deeply buried within the folds <ref type="bibr" coords="7,354.75,553.63,13.74,10.17" target="#b18">[19]</ref> . Moreover, cross-subject analysis of brain cortical structures and functions needs, as a prerequisite step, the alignment of homologous regions. By parameterizing brain surfaces on a common domain, they are naturally correlated via homotopic parameter coordinates. Suppose M 1 and M 2 are two brain surfaces, and </p><formula> ϕ 1 : M 1 → R 2 and ϕ 2 : M 2 → R 2 are the parameterizations, respectively . Through the composition ϕ −1 2 @BULLET ϕ 1 : M 1 → M 2 </formula><p>, a one-to-one correspondence is defined between M 1 and M 2 . To simplify the process , 3D surfaces can be represented as a shape vector image g(u, v) retained in a 2D domain <ref type="bibr" coords="7,380.97,644.68,13.75,10.17" target="#b17">[18]</ref> , where the co-registered modalities are uniformly indexed by regular pixels. In this procedure, the brain surface is sliced open along the medial plane at the bottom, without passing any significant anatomical features. The entire brain surface is then mapped to a rectangle with the height/width ratio equal to 1:2. In almost all situations, the top and lateral portions of the brain surface, where the most meaningful anatomies and functional regions reside, are squeezed into a very small area of the domain after the conformal mapping (<ref type="figure" coords="7,330.86,724.39,19.70,10.17" target="#fig_13">Fig. 5</ref> (c)). With the uniform sampling through the entire domain , shape vector images turn out not to have enough samples, at the locations with severely squeezed distortion, to capture the geometric as well as neurological characteristics of the brain cortex. This issue is well addressed by employing our newly proposed approach. As shown in <ref type="figure" coords="8,31.89,81.20,20.06,10.17" target="#fig_13">Fig. 5</ref> (d), now the surface sampling is much more evenly distributed . The shading effects are generated by using the original normals in order to visualize the correspondence between the brain surface and the rectangular domain. Normal brain function is dependent on the interactions between specialized regions of the brain which process information with local and global neurological networks. To capture the statistics of abnormal brain activity, a sufficient number of sampling points should be grouped at certain resolution. Each unit forms a cortical element. Since the surface of the brain is uneven and varies across human subjects , the task of subdividing it into a set of equal geometric elements is nontrivial. Instead, we can easily define finite homotopic cortical elements in the parametric domain with simple isotropic grid, as shown in <ref type="figure" coords="8,32.79,211.20,21.12,10.17" target="#fig_13">Fig. 5</ref>(c) and 5(d). Then, the elements can be reversely mapped back into the subject's native space, probing any modalities of interest. Note that, thanks to the area-preserving property of the proposed parameterization method, each element accounts for an identical amount of portion in the original brain surface. For the purpose of comparison , we also include a parametric domain generated by the conformal parameterization. Two homotopic cortical elements are highlighted in red and blue, respectively. Using conformal parameterization, the element highlighted in red will be assigned with excessive cortical area, while for the element highlighted in blue, little feature is covered. This drawback is greatly eliminated by using the authalic parameterization . As shown in <ref type="figure" coords="8,104.44,320.79,20.82,10.17" target="#fig_13">Fig. 5</ref>(d), both elements can capture an equal patch on the brain surface. With these well-defined equiareal cortical elements, a variety of functional patterns can be readily quantified on a per element basis. In our experiment, the functional characteristics of brain cortical activation is captured by Positron Emission Tomography (PET), while the detailed structural information is obtained from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In order to integrate PET and MRI data, a normal fusion approach is performed in the native space of each subject, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" coords="8,112.01,400.49,20.38,10.17" target="#fig_13">Fig. 5</ref> (a). Typically, the PET tracer concentration is calculated by averaging its measurement along the inverse normal direction within 10mm from the cortical surface. The obtained value is then mapped to the brain surface (<ref type="figure" coords="8,176.15,430.38,19.48,10.17" target="#fig_13">Fig. 5</ref>(b)). Once normative brain patterns for each element are derived from a group of control subjects, whether a particular cortical element derived from a patient falls into the abnormal can be subsequently determined according to the comparison against the normative reference. The PET deviation degree is the basis for the classification of functional abnormality of cortical elements. This framework allows consistent integration and quantitative analysis of multiple functional brain patterns. The inclusion of other imaging data such as gray matter thickness measured by MRI is conceivable. Since in reality the deviation degrees of different modalities rarely coincide, it is interesting and important to examine the degree of agreement among several modalities and its statistical significance. We will explore along this direction in the future work. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p> In this paper, we have presented a surface parameterization methodology that is rigorously area-preserving in its continuous theory. Given an initial parameterization, an area-preserving one can be efficiently and uniquely obtained via the Lie advection of area forms along the domain. This approach can be easily extended to parameterize more general surfaces as long as the initial parameterization is provided. Our implementation strives to preserve the analytical ingredients of the computation as far as possible. As a result, our method only involves moderate computation and is stable in getting consistent results, as opposed to an optimization approach. We have also demonstrated the utility of our method by creating area-preserving maps of both cortical hemispheres and the entire cortex. As shown in the figures and the statistics throughout the experiments, the property of preserving area structure of the original surface may better facilitate present quantitative analysis frameworks for various neuroimaging data. A known limitation of the cotangent formulation of Beltrami operator is that it deals not well with degenerate meshes. Adaptive edge flipping and subdivision may alleviate this problem to some extent. Alternatively, more delicate and robust approximation schemes of Laplace-Beltrami operator, such as the one recently proposed in <ref type="bibr" coords="8,320.09,604.78,9.52,10.17" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, could be used when presented with extremely skinny triangles. We have observed that long protrusions can result in severe squeezing effects on a flat domain in areas approaching their bases. Because for general manifolds, no isometric mapping exists except for a few special cases, it is essentially a compromise at the expense of area preservation. However, a rigorous area-preserving parameterization technique is still of fundamental importance in both theoretical and practical senses, as it answers the open problem left in <ref type="bibr" coords="8,481.57,684.51,10.45,10.17" target="#b6">[7] </ref>by showing that, other than the conformal mapping, its authalic counterpart can be practically found in a mathematically rigorous manner. Besides surface parameterization, another potential area that may benefit from this work is point-based graphics <ref type="bibr" coords="8,457.33,724.38,9.71,10.17" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,470.02,724.38,6.47,10.17" target="#b0"> 1]</ref>. When it deals with implicit surface and point set surface visualization, a major issue is to redistribute sampling points within a surface to facilitate compact and flexible modeling of 3D objects. The underlying computational model is typically a dynamical particle system <ref type="bibr" coords="9,204.53,71.24,13.74,10.17" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Based on some local potential energy profiles, the inter-particle forces determine the final density and location of sampling points <ref type="bibr" coords="9,194.93,91.16,13.75,10.17" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. It is not surprising that the involved computation is expensive. And similar to functional parameterization methods, it gives rise to the common pitfalls of optimization-based approaches. Our method provides a radically different mechanism to control point samples and distribute them according to the needs of applications, which is formulated in the language of differential forms on the manifold. Exact sample spacing control can be achieved via a prescription of area scaling factor. Unlike most classical methods, the computation is deterministic. The particle system generated using our method can provide a uniform sampling density over the surface from the parametric domain, but not isotropic in general. We believe the computational performance and runtime for this approach can still be improved. A multiresolution mesh representation, e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="9,50.01,231.13,13.74,10.17" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, can be directly incorporated into our method, giving rise to a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine approach. Beside brain surface mapping , we also envision a broad range of applications of Lie advection in graphics, geometric modeling and visualization, such as geometry images <ref type="bibr" coords="9,59.15,270.98,13.74,10.17" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, point-set surfaces <ref type="bibr" coords="9,143.72,270.98,9.52,10.17" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and glyph packing <ref type="bibr" coords="9,227.16,270.98,13.75,10.17" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. </p></div>

All diffeomorphisms of M to itself are called the diffeomorphism group of M. Here we denote it as Diff(M). A prominent advantage of diffeomorphisms, compared with other maps , is that the neighborhood structure is preserved, i.e., connected sets remain connected while disjoint ones remain disjoint, and the coordinates are transformed smoothly. For this reason, diffeomorphism has become a major non-rigid deformation model used for image registration and comparison.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B DIFFERENTIAL FORMS </head><p> Differential forms are at the foundation of modern differential geometry , which consistently express integral and differential equations on smooth and curved spaces in a coordinate-independent way. Moreover , they often reflect underlying geometric structures and invariants in concise forms. Formally, let M be a smooth manifold. All tangential vectors at a point p ∈ M form a vector space T p M, namely the tangent space to M at p. A k-form ω k is an anti-symmetric, covariant tensor field of rank-k over M, such that at each point p ∈ M, ω k defines a multi-linear map </p><formula>ω k : T p M × ··· × T p M → R, </formula><formula>(26) </formula><p>which changes signs for odd permutations of the components. Note that a sub-manifold of M naturally inherits a k-form from M by restricting the linear map to the domain that is the product of tangent spaces of the sub-manifold. We consider surfaces as 2-manifolds embedded in R 3 . In such a case, non-zero forms only exist for dimensions ranging from 0 and 2, which can be intuitively conceived as a scalar field for 0-form, a tangent vector field for 1-form, and a bivector (induced by two coplanar vectors) field for 2-form. In turn, applying forms to vector fields amounts to @BULLET 0-form: ω 0 (v) ≡ ω 0 v; </p><formula>@BULLET 1-form: ω 1 (v) ≡ ω 1 · v; </formula><formula>@BULLET 2-form: ω 2 (u, v) ≡ ω 2 · (u × v). </formula><p> To facilitate formulation of how the authalic surface mapping is derived , we also introduce a set of essential operators that are used to manipulate differential forms: @BULLET Exterior Derivative (d). It generalizes the notion of the differential of a function to forms. According to the rank k of the form ω k , d corresponds to the gradient ∇, the curl ∇×, and the divergence ∇·, when k = 0, 1, 2, respectively. @BULLET Hodge Star (). It maps a k-form to a complementary (n − k)form . According to the dimension of the form, we define it as </p><formula>f = f du ∧ dv, ,du = dv, ,dv = −du, , f du ∧ dv = f . </formula><p>@BULLET Wedge Product (∧). It constructs a higher degree form by ω i+ j = ω i ∧ω j , extending the notion of exterior product to forms. In R 3 , the wedge product of two 1-forms, α and β , can be identified via the standard cross product as </p><formula>α ∧ β ≡ α × β . </formula><p> @BULLET Interior Product (i V ). It is defined to be the contraction of a differential form with a vector field V . In our case, it can be computed as </p><formula>i V ω 1 = ω 1 ·V, i V ω 2 = ω 2 ×V. </formula><p> @BULLET Lie Derivative (L V ). When defined on differential forms, it extends the notion of directional derivative, which instead estimates the change of one form along the flow of the given vector field V . By Cartan's homotopy identity, </p><formula>L V = d(i V ) + i V d. </formula><p>Beware that our definition of operators is specific to surfaces. Care should be taken when extending them to other spaces. We also refer readers to <ref type="bibr" coords="9,345.24,581.67,10.46,10.17" target="#b5">[6] </ref>and references therein for a complete exposition of differential forms in the context of computational modeling. The area element indeed is a 2-form on the surface, which acts on two tangent vectors u, v ∈ T S p given a point p, and returns the area of the parallelogram spanned by them. Consider a diffeomorphism f : M → N with ω N being the area element on N. The pullback of ω N is a 2-form on M, denoted as f * (ω N ), and defined as </p><formula>f * (ω N )(u, v) = ω N (d f (u), d f (v)). </formula><formula>(27) </formula><p>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS </p><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for their valuable comments.

			<note place="foot" n="4">.1 Initial Parameterization In practice, we have chosen to use conformal parameterization to initialize our system, mainly for its robustness and abundant theoretical support. We first assume the target flat domain is a unit square, as is commonly used to parameterize topological disks. Later, we will show how this framework can be extended to accommodate more flexible boundary conditions. The square boundary condition is set up as follows: first, the boundary is isometrically mapped to that of the unit square D; next, a discrete conformal map of the interior is computed in the least squares fashion. By selecting an arbitrary boundary vertex and assigning a corner of D to it, the initial boundary map can be sequentially laid out along ∂ D, with consistent edge orientation relative to the original surface model . To avoid length distortion, we allocate for each edge an amount of the boundary proportional to its original length. Triangle degeneracies may incur when all the three vertices are on the boundary and mapped to one of the four sides of the square. Whenever such a triangle arises , we split its non-boundary edge(s) by inserting a new vertex at the midpoint. Moreover, when an edge spans one of the four corners of D, the edge is broken by introducing a vertex at the domain corner, thus splitting its incident triangle into two. Having the boundary pinned down, the interior mapping can be solved via a linear system very efficiently, as detailed in [24]. The non-uniform local area stretching induced by the initial parameterization can be characterized by the finite model/parameter area ratio associated with each vertex v i , denoted as λ i . If the parameterization is conformal, λ is called the discrete conformal factor. Fig. 1(a) and 1(b) show the lateral and mesial views of a cortical hemisphere, respectively . The initial (conformal) parameterization is illustrated in Fig. 1(c), the area distortion of which is color encoded in Fig. 1(d). Some lateral cortical patterns suffer from the intensive geometric stretch which seriously impairs the inspection of these regions. Note that, the subsequent computation of authalic parameterization is deterministic to the initial parameterization provided. It is interesting to see how the</note>
