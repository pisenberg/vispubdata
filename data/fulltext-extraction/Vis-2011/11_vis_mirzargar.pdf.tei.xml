			<abstract>
				<p>—We present a quasi interpolation framework that attains the optimal approximation-order of Voronoi splines for reconstruction of volumetric data sampled on general lattices. The quasi interpolation framework of Voronoi splines provides an unbiased reconstruction method across various lattices. Therefore this framework allows us to analyze and contrast the sampling-theoretic performance of general lattices, using signal reconstruction, in an unbiased manner. Our quasi interpolation methodology is implemented as an efficient FIR filter that can be applied online or as a preprocessing step. We present visual and numerical experiments that demonstrate the improved accuracy of reconstruction across lattices, using the quasi interpolation framework.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p> Analysis, processing and visualization of biomedical data, fluid dynamics simulations, seismic, geological and astronomical data entail sampling and reconstruction of multidimensional signals. Similarly, modelling environmental phenomena like global warming and pollution involve sampling and reconstruction of multidimensional signals that consist of spatio-temporal dimensions together with a large number of other parameters like temperature and solar radiation (e.g., SensorScope <ref type="bibr" coords="1,80.37,307.52,9.41,8.12" target="#b2">[3]</ref> ). As visualization and data analysis approaches mature and find a wide range of applications from biomedical and scientific imaging to various engineering disciplines, the efficiency of sampling and accuracy of reconstruction become more important as they directly influence the quality, usability and reliability of these tools <ref type="bibr" coords="1,51.18,357.33,14.19,8.12" target="#b28">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,67.62,357.33,11.21,8.12" target="#b27"> 24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,81.06,357.33,10.65,8.12" target="#b52"> 49]</ref>. The notion of efficient sampling has been widely studied in signal processing. The best sampling rate of a 1-D signal is determined by the Nyquist frequency which is the supremum of the frequencies present in the signal's spectrum. For a multidimensional signal the notion of Nyquist frequencies involve the geometry of its spectrum. The best sampling rate in the multidimensional sense is given by a datadependent , instance-optimal lattice that can periodically replicate the spectrum of the signal as densely as possible <ref type="bibr" coords="1,196.06,437.34,14.19,8.12" target="#b41">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,212.78,437.34,11.21,8.12" target="#b15"> 14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,226.49,437.34,10.65,8.12" target="#b49"> 46]</ref>. Therefore, depending on the geometries of signal spectra, their optimal sampling lattices vary. Given the geometric knowledge about the spectrum of the signal, one can compute optimal sampling lattices for that specific signal <ref type="bibr" coords="1,55.16,477.19,13.75,8.12" target="#b33">[30]</ref>. Modern notions of sampling theory exploit the sparsity of spectrum of signals for sub-Nyquist sampling of signals in shift-invariant spaces <ref type="bibr" coords="1,58.14,507.39,13.75,8.12" target="#b17">[16]</ref> . Notably, the framework of sampling in union of shiftinvariant spaces <ref type="bibr" coords="1,90.59,517.35,14.94,8.12" target="#b32">[29] </ref>(with several sampling lattices <ref type="bibr" coords="1,218.76,517.35,10.08,8.12" target="#b5">[4]</ref> ) offers a practical approach for sub-Nyquist sampling and perfect reconstruction. Despite the theoretical advances in the geometric aspects of lattices in sampling theory, signal reconstruction (i.e., interpolation and approximation from the given sampled data) in the general multidimensional framework is under-developed and multidimensional filters that inherit the geometry of a given lattice are rare; tensor-product or radial basis extensions of 1-D filters (i.e., tensor-product B-splines) disregard the geometry of the lattices and lead to unacceptable solu- tions <ref type="bibr" coords="1,51.18,607.32,14.19,8.12" target="#b50">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,67.62,607.32,11.21,8.12" target="#b47"> 44,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,81.06,607.32,10.65,8.12" target="#b46"> 43]</ref>. Voronoi splines (V-splines) introduced by the authors <ref type="bibr" coords="1,244.73,617.59,14.94,8.12" target="#b37">[34] </ref>are a non-separable generalization of the 1-D B-splines to higher dimensional lattices. V-splines are constructed based on the Voronoi cell  of any arbitrary lattice and provide a family of reconstruction kernels with any desired level of smoothness and approximation order, tailored for that particular lattice. V-splines are compactly-supported functions that generate lattice-shift-invariant spline spaces for approximation of multivariate data. In <ref type="bibr" coords="1,409.44,277.32,14.94,8.12" target="#b37">[34] </ref> we derived the explicit construction of V-splines in terms of box splines and used them for reconstruction of data sampled on common sampling lattices. However, our existing framework does not exploit the optimal approximation capabilities of V-splines. In this paper we address the issue of optimal-order approximation with Voronoi splines using the framework of quasi- interpolation <ref type="bibr" coords="1,342.19,337.10,13.75,8.12" target="#b12">[11]</ref>. Contributions @BULLET In the current paper we explicitly derive the Fourier transform of V-splines and study them in the context of common 3-D sampling lattices. This development allows us to study and contrast the frequency response of the nearest neighbor interpolation on any lattice. This study is then extended to higher-order cases. @BULLET Using the Fourier transforms of V-splines, we present a local quasi-interpolation method that can be implemented as a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. Our quasi-interpolation filters enable us to exploit the optimal approximation order afforded by V-splines. Hence, we present numerical as well as visual experiments that demonstrate the increase in the accuracy of reconstruction provided by our quasi-interpolation compared to <ref type="bibr" coords="1,523.84,481.26,13.75,8.12" target="#b37">[34]</ref>. @BULLET The Fourier analysis of V-splines allows us to compare common sampling lattices in terms of their " natural " smoothing and postaliasing properties. We present a comparison of over-smoothing and post-aliasing effects of V-splines among these lattices. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Multidimensional Lattices</head><p>A point lattice can be considered as a subset of Euclidean space that is formed by periodic arrangement of discrete points. A lattice is required to include origin and because of the discrete nature of the lattice there is a region in which origin is the only lattice point which is called the Voronoi region for the origin. Since a lattice is closed under addition and negation, Voronoi region can be associated to any lattice point applying a translation. Hence, the Voronoi region or formally known as Voronoi cell of a lattice is unique and is referred to as fundamental domain or Wigner-Seitz cell <ref type="bibr" coords="1,399.12,635.21,13.75,8.12" target="#b45">[42]</ref>. A sampling lattice can be formed by integer multiples of a non-unique sampling matrix L. Sampling points on the lattice is represented by integer multiples of the columns of this matrix, also known as basis for the lattice. There are infinitely many basis for a given lattice and all sampling matrices characterizing a sampling lattice are related via a unimodular matrix <ref type="bibr" coords="1,510.29,685.02,14.94,8.12" target="#b49">[46] </ref>(i.e., L = PL, with |det P| = 1). The Cartesian lattice, in dimension d, can be simply represented by d × d identity matrix. When sampling a signal on a lattice L, the spectrum of the signal is replicated, in the Fourier domain, on the reciprocal lattice that corresponds to the sampling lattice given byˆLbyˆ byˆL = 2πL −T . <ref type="figure" coords="2,22.50,145.88,21.17,8.12">Fig. 1</ref> .

Together with the cube, hexagonal prism and elongated rhombic dodecahedron, these polyhedra (called Fedorov parallelohedra) characterize all 3-D lattices. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p> Over the recent years, there has been an increased interest on optimal sampling lattices. Theußl et al <ref type="bibr" coords="2,148.83,636.70,14.94,8.12" target="#b47">[44] </ref>introduced the BCC sampling scheme for volume rendering applications. In this work, they assumed samples on the BCC lattice together with a spherical extension of reconstruction kernels; they achieve a similar quality as a Cartesian representation with fewer samples. However, the quality of the images rendered with this approach were rather unsatisfying since the images were blurry <ref type="bibr" coords="2,66.32,696.48,13.75,8.12" target="#b47">[44]</ref>. The non-separable (i.e., not a tensor-product) geometry of general lattices prohibits one from using tensor-product B-splines on these lattices . Recently it has been established that a particular non-separable four-directional box spline leads to a C 2 reconstruction on the BCC lattice <ref type="bibr" coords="2,309.02,159.96,14.94,8.12" target="#b21">[20] </ref>and a six-directional lattice leads to a C 1 reconstruction on the FCC lattice <ref type="bibr" coords="2,345.72,169.93,13.75,8.12" target="#b30">[27]</ref>. In the following section, we briefly review the basic definition and properties of box splines that are pertinent to this paper. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Box Splines Review</head><p> A box spline is a smooth compactly-supported, piecewise polynomial function (defined on R 2 , R 3 or generally in R d ), that is associated with a set of vectors that are usually gathered in a matrix: <ref type="bibr" coords="2,327.29,249.97,13.75,8.12" target="#b14">[13]</ref>. From a convolution-based point of view, box splines are constructed by repeated convolutions of elementary line-segment distributions along each vector in Ξ. Denoting x := (x1, x2, . . . , x d ), we have: </p><formula>Ξ = [ξ 1 . . . ξ N ] </formula><formula>M Ξ (x) = (M ξ 1 * · · · * M ξ N ) (x), </formula><formula>(2) </formula><p> where the elementary box splines, M ξ n , are Dirac-like line distributions supported over x = tξ n with t ∈ <ref type="bibr" coords="2,431.08,325.35,9.72,8.97">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,442.34,325.35,6.27,8.97" target="#b0"> 1]</ref>. These elementary box splines are in direct geometric correspondence (via a rotation and a proper scaling) with the primary box spline Me 1 (x) = box(x1)δ(x2, . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>. . , x d ) </head><p>where e1 = [1, 0, . . . , 0] T , δ(x2, . . . , x d ) is the (d − 1)-dimensional Dirac distribution, and box(x) = 1 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 0 otherwise . </p><p>Moreover, all box splines will integrate to 1 and this property will be preserved through convolution. Box splines are positive functions that have compact supports. The support of a box spline is determined by the Minkowski sum of its directions in Ξ (see <ref type="figure" coords="2,451.52,476.55,28.90,8.12" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>). The center of the support of M Ξ (x) is given by </p><formula>c Ξ := 1 2 N n=1 ξ n . </formula><p>The Fourier transform of the box spline is therefore given by: </p><formula>ˆ M Ξ (ω) = exp (−j c Ξ , ω) N n=1 sinc (ξ n , ω), </formula><formula>(3) </formula><p>where ω := (ω1, . . . , ω d ) is the multivariate frequency vector and sinc function is defined as: sinc(ω) := sin(ω/2) </p><formula>(ω/2) </formula><p>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repetition of Directions </head><p>When the direction set Ξ of a box spline is fixed, one can consider box splines created by repetitions of the directions in Ξ using a repetition-vector ρ = [ρ1, ρ2, . . . , <ref type="bibr" coords="2,508.40,599.58,14.07,8.97">ρN ]</ref>. In this notation, the box spline that corresponds to the ρ has the direction matrix: </p><formula>Mρ(x) := M [ξ 1 . . . ξ 1 ρ 1 times ··· ξ N . . . ξ N ρ N times ] </formula><p>(x). </p><formula>(4) </formula><p>For example fixing Ξ = I3 to the 3 × 3 identity matrix, the base directions in this box spline are orthogonal to each other which makes this a tensor-product B-spline. Fixing the base direction set allows us to denote the indicator function of the unit cube 1 as a box spline </p><formula>M [2,2,2] (x) = M [e 1 e 1 e 2 e 2 e 3 e 3 ] (x). </formula><p>Similarly, the tricubic B-spline is given by M <ref type="bibr" coords="3,201.88,286.32,8.44,5.98" target="#b5">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,210.32,286.32,5.63,5.98" target="#b5">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,215.95,286.32,5.63,5.98" target="#b5">4] </ref>. This is due to the fact that the linear and cubic B-splines are obtained by convolving the box function with itself two and four times respectively. The self-convolution along each direction e is denoted by repeating that direction. Entezari et al <ref type="bibr" coords="3,89.48,334.65,14.19,8.12" target="#b19">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,105.40,334.65,11.21,8.12" target="#b18"> 17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,118.34,334.65,11.95,8.12" target="#b21"> 20] </ref> introduced box spline reconstruction algorithms for reconstruction on the BCC lattice that adhere to the geometry of the BCC lattice. Approximation methods have been proposed for the BCC lattice <ref type="bibr" coords="3,101.91,364.54,14.94,8.12" target="#b20">[19] </ref>(C 2 , fourth-order), and FCC lattice <ref type="bibr" coords="3,248.06,364.54,14.94,8.12" target="#b30">[27] </ref>(C 1 , third-order), based on the principle of quasi-interpolation introduced by de Boor <ref type="bibr" coords="3,76.70,384.47,13.75,8.12" target="#b12">[11]</ref>. Meng et al <ref type="bibr" coords="3,143.48,384.47,13.75,8.12" target="#b36">[33]</ref>, confirmed that these advantages significantly improve the visual quality of the visualization pipeline based on the BCC sampling lattice. Finkbeiner et al <ref type="bibr" coords="3,217.42,404.39,14.94,8.12" target="#b22">[21] </ref>have recently developed a GPU implementation of a fast algorithm for convolution of BCC sampled data with the above-mentioned box splines. Csébfalvi <ref type="bibr" coords="3,77.79,435.89,10.46,8.12" target="#b9">[8] </ref>proposed a global pre-processing algorithm (based on generalized interpolation <ref type="bibr" coords="3,122.97,445.85,14.34,8.12" target="#b48">[45]</ref>) that reconstructs the BCC lattice based on its two Cartesian sub-lattices. Then local prefiltering approaches were proposed <ref type="bibr" coords="3,85.53,465.77,10.46,8.12" target="#b10">[9] </ref>based on the quasi-interpolation with B-splines <ref type="bibr" coords="3,266.94,465.77,14.94,8.12" target="#b12">[11] </ref>that were adapted for image processing applications <ref type="bibr" coords="3,221.80,475.73,9.52,8.12" target="#b7">[6]</ref> . Decomposition of the BCC lattice into two Cartesian sub-lattices has the advantage that one can use the readily-available tensor-product B-spline ap- proaches <ref type="bibr" coords="3,65.96,505.62,14.94,8.12" target="#b11">[10] </ref>that are attractive from hardware implementation point of view. However, the decomposition of BCC or FCC lattices into sublattices disregards the topological structure <ref type="bibr" coords="3,189.84,525.55,14.94,8.12" target="#b24">[23] </ref>of the lattice; hence, the drawback of this approach is that the neighborhood of each lattice point is distorted. </p></div>

For example, C 0 and C 2 box splines (2nd and 4th order of approximation) for BCC lattice and C 1 (3rd order of approximation ) on FCC have been separately compared against tensor product B-spline of same approximation power on Cartesian <ref type="bibr" coords="3,234.44,636.71,14.19,8.12" target="#b21">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,250.68,636.71,10.65,8.12" target="#b30"> 27]</ref>. Yet, comparable box splines (in terms of approximation order and continuity ) on different lattices are very rare. In contrast, the V-splines framework (similar to the 1-D B-splines) allows us to design convolution kernels of the same properties for any lattice. Therefore, V-splines offer a unifying approach to reconstruction on various sampling lattices . This allows us to compare the sampling-theoretic performance of Cartesian, BCC and FCC lattices on representative 3-D datasets. Since V-spline constructions are identical on these 3-D lattices, the reconstructed datasets reflect the sampling-theoretic differences between these lattices in the most unbiased manner that is practically possible. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Voronoi Splines</head><p>Voronoi splines proposed in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,410.43,66.65,13.75,8.12" target="#b37">[34]</ref> , as a generalization of Hex- Splines <ref type="bibr" coords="3,322.57,76.61,13.75,8.12" target="#b50">[47]</ref> , are constructed based on successive convolutions of simple indicator functions.

The box function, in the univariate setting, is a convolution kernel which provides a nearest neighbor interpolation. Convolution of sampled signal with β0 leads to a piecewise-constant approximation to the function. The notion of nearest neighbor interpolation in the multidimensional lattice setting is formally defined by the Voronoi cell (see Section 1.1) of the lattice as in <ref type="figure" coords="3,395.39,166.37,29.40,8.12">Figure 1</ref> .

Quasi interpolation converts the sampled data to spline coefficients in a way to guarantee exact reconstruction had the sampled data been from any polynomial of up to certain degree. Polynomial reproduction, as many as the generator function allows, guarantees the optimal asymptotic behavior of the approximation error (i.e., optimal n) when the generator function is compactly sup- ported <ref type="bibr" coords="4,48.21,153.94,13.75,8.12" target="#b13">[12]</ref>. In contrast, the optimal approximation error, for a fixed h, is only attained by the orthogonal projection. Since the orthogonal projection is often not practical, the quasi interpolation, via polynomial reproduction, offers an efficient alternative that maintains the same asymptotic decay in the approximation error. A quasi-interpolant, Q, involves the transformation of the input function f to fν n via a convolution: </p><formula>fν n (x) :=(νn * f )(x), </formula><p>where ν is a continuous generalized function (such as Dirac delta or sum of its derivatives) with a bounded and local support.

In order to design suitable quasi interpolation for V-splines, we need to analyze their frequency response as the Fourier transform of the basis function provides a recipe for designing ν. We first present the geometric structure of V-splines that are needed to derive their Fourier transform. Then, we will derive the quasi-interpolation framework for V-splines and study their implementation. </p></div>

Since the BCC and FCC lattice are of interest in the context of sampling, we present their parallelepiped decomposition that is used for characterization of V-splines for these lattices.

Similarly, the zones of the BCC lattice, given by Ξ B , decompose the truncated octahedron to 16 parallelepipeds. While in the FCC case, all parallelepipeds, share a corner with the origin, in the BCC case, the parallelepipeds are translated by certain vectors as illustrated in <ref type="figure" coords="4,294.34,225.41,29.01,8.12" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>. The indicator function of each parallelepiped can be represented by a (simple) box spline whose direction set are the three distinct edges of the parallelepiped. Therefore, we can write the indicator function of the Voronoi cell of each lattice, V L 0 , as the sum of (constant, firstorder ) box splines whose directions are given from respective zone- decomposition. For example, the first-order V-spline on the FCC lattice is given by 4 building-block box splines (constant functions on the parallelepipeds in the decomposition): </p><formula>V F 0 (x) = 1 4 M [1,1,1,0] (x) + M [1,0,1,1] (x)+ M [1,1,0,1] (x) + M [0,1,1,1] (x) </formula><p> We can organize these 4 repetition vectors as rows of a repetition matrix that is documented in <ref type="figure" coords="4,383.04,383.79,26.10,8.12" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.

Since higher order V-splines are constructed by the convolution of the first order V-spline by itself, we can use the convolution theorem to derive the frequency domain representation of V L n . We first recall that the Fourier transform of the box function is given by the sinc function: box(x) ⇔ sinc(ω). For the Cartesian lattice, the Fourier transform of V C 0 , the indicator function of the centered-unit cube, is given by the tensor-product: </p><formula>ˆ V C 0 (ω) = </formula><p>sinc e1, ω sinc e2, ω sinc e3, ω </p><formula>(15) </formula><p>Let χ denote the indicator function of the unit cube, cornered at the origin.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Quasi Interpolation</head><p>In the multivariate setting, there are several approaches to derive quasi interpolation for a general reconstruction kernel, such as methods based on Neumann series, Appell sequences via Marsden's identity, or Fourier transform <ref type="bibr" coords="6,99.85,242.83,13.75,8.12" target="#b14">[13]</ref>. Since the Fourier transforms of V-splines are explicitly available in closed-form (see Section 3.2), we choose this method for the generalization of the Fourier method, which was originally developed for box splines, to the class of V-splines. Let the α := (α1, α2, α3), |α| := α1 + α2 + α3 and [<ref type="bibr" coords="6,230.49,282.13,7.66,8.97">[x]</ref>] α denote the normalized monomial in the trivariate setting, defined as: </p><formula>[[x]] α := x α α! = x α 1 y α 2 z α 3 α1!α2!α3! . </formula><p> Moreover, we define a differential operator D α that takes partial derives of orders given by the vector α. This notation allows us to write the Taylor series expansion of a function as: </p><formula>f (x) = α [[x]] α D α f (0). </formula><p> The optimal approximation order is achieved by (8) whenever all loworder polynomials (|α| ≤ n) in the Taylor expansion are reproduced exactly by the quasi interpolation as described below. This scheme is optimal since polynomials in the Taylor expansion that have higher power (|α| &gt; n) can not be reproduced by the (8), since n is picked to be the largest that can be afforded by the reconstruction kernel Vn. Considering the approximation order of a general reconstruction kernel Vn is n + 1, we know <ref type="bibr" coords="6,135.12,473.54,14.94,8.12" target="#b37">[34] </ref>that any polynomial in Π ≤n can be reproduced by the LSI space as in (7). The ability to (exactly) reproduce Π ≤n means that convolution with Vn is an invertible linear transformation on this polynomial space. Therefore, if we study the action of Vn on some basis of this space, we will be able to systematically invert it. This idea gives us a recipe for construction of a continuous (generalized) function νn introduced in (8) that inverts the transformation that Vn performs on Π ≤n . In other words, we need to find νn such that: </p><formula>(Vn * νn * f )(x) = f (x), </formula><formula>(21) </formula><p>whenever f ∈ Π ≤n . For general functions f , this scheme reproduces the first few polynomial terms (as many as Vn can afford) of the Taylor series. Therefore, νn is designed in such a way that it inverts the action of Vn on Π ≤n . For designing νn, we consider the transformation on normalized monomials that are a basis for Π ≤n . Let gα(x) be a polynomial that is the transformation of [<ref type="bibr" coords="6,111.22,647.72,7.66,8.97">[x]</ref>] α with the action of a generic νn. gα(x) = νn(x) * [<ref type="bibr" coords="6,172.10,666.46,7.66,8.97">[x]</ref>] α . </p><formula>(22) </formula><p>When νn(x) = δ(x), then we have the identity transformation on the polynomial space that corresponds to sampling the function itself (fν = f ) in (8).

For a given α, |α| ≤ n the general coefficient vector c of νn(x) allows us to define gα(x), in its monomial expansion by substituting (24) in (22): </p><formula>gα(x) = β≤α c β [[x]] α−β . </formula><formula>(25) </formula><p>The coefficients of any polynomial, including gα, can be extracted by taking derivatives and evaluating the resulting polynomial at zero: </p><formula>c β = δ (α−β) (x) * gα(x) x=0 =D α−β gα(0) = (jω) α−βˆgαα−βˆ α−βˆgα(ω)dω. </formula><formula>(26) </formula><p>The latter equation is due to the fact that the evaluation of a function at zero, amounts to the integration of its Fourier transform in the frequency space (i.e., DC value in space domain). The Fourier transform of D α−β gα(x) is given by (jω) α−βˆgαα−βˆ α−βˆgα(ω) due to the derivative the- orem. Now, we are ready to design νn by choosing its coefficients c in such a way that the action of Vn transforms gα functions back to normalized monomials – inverting νn on Π ≤n : </p><formula>[[x]] α = Vn(x) * gα(x). </formula><formula>(27) </formula><p>Equivalently, in the frequency domain, we have: </p><formula>ˆ gα(ω) = j α δ (α) (ω) ˆ Vn(ω) . </formula><formula>(28) </formula><p>Substituting (28) into (26), we have: </p><formula>c β = j α (jω) α−βˆVn α−βˆ α−βˆVn(ω) δ (α) (ω)dω = j α D α (jω) α−βˆVn α−βˆ α−βˆVn(ω) ω=0 . </formula><p> The latter equation is due to the distributional definition of δ (α) defined in (23). In particular, we have: </p><formula>cα = D α j α ˆ Vn(ω) ω=0 . </formula><formula>(29) </formula><p>This equation gives us a recipe for construction of νn that inverts Vn, using the coefficient vector c and (24). Essentially the coefficients of νn are the derivatives of 1/ ˆ Vn(ω), the inverse of the Fourier transform of the reconstruction kernel, evaluated at the DC frequency. Since we know the Fourier transforms of V-splines in closed form (Section 3.2), this method allows us to derive quasi interpolation formulation for any order V-spline for any lattice. We have performed derivative calculation of (18) and (19) in a symbolic environment (Mathematica). The only non-zero coefficients cα for |α| ≤ 2 (i.e. for third order V-spline) on BCC, FCC and Cartesian lattices involve second order partial derivatives of the Dirac function from (30): δ (2,0,0) ,δ (0,2,0) , δ (0,0,2) . This means that ν2 on these lattices takes the second-order partial derivatives of the input function f to build fν 2 to be used in quasi interpolation as in (8). Specifically for the Cartesian, BCC and FCC lattices the ν2 that inverts the operations of third order V-splines on their respective lattices are obtained from (29), (18) and (19): </p><formula>ν B 2 (x) := δ(x) − 3 16 δ (2,0,0) (x) + δ (0,2,0) (x) + δ (0,0,2) (x) ν F 2 (x) := δ(x) − 19 64 δ (2,0,0) (x) + δ (0,2,0) (x) + δ (0,0,2) (x) ν C 2 (x) := δ(x) − 1 8 δ (2,0,0) (x) + δ (0,2,0) (x) + δ (0,0,2) (x) </formula><p>(30) Essentially ν2 computed a weighted Laplacian on each case to derive fν 2 from f . Therefore we need to evaluate second order derivatives of f along X, Y and Z axis. However, on the BCC and FCC lattices, the Laplacian involves directional derivatives along the lattice directions defined as: </p><formula>D ξ f (x) := lim h→0 f (x+hξ)−f (x) h </formula><p>. The conversion of directional derivatives to derivatives along X, Y and Z is possible via a linear transformation that involves lattice directions. Lattice directions, on each lattice, are obtained from the directions that form by connecting a lattice point to its Delaunay neighbors <ref type="bibr" coords="7,251.06,310.02,14.19,8.12" target="#b20">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,267.68,310.02,10.65,8.12" target="#b30"> 27]</ref>. Specifically, for the BCC and FCC lattices the Laplacian is the sum of second-order directional derivatives along lattice directions: </p><formula>ξ∈B D 2 ξ = 4 D (2,0,0) + D (0,2,0) + D (0,0,2) ξ∈F D 2 ξ = 4 D (2,0,0) + D (0,2,0) + D (0,0,2) , </formula><formula>(31) </formula><p> where the sums, on the left hand side, are taken over the nearest Delaunay neighbors that denote the lattice directions on each lattice. In order to employ these directional derivatives on sampled volumetric data, we need to replace the directional derivatives with directional finite differences. The numerical order of finite differencing scheme is chosen according to the optimal order that is desired by the quasi interpolation method <ref type="bibr" coords="7,129.88,455.82,13.75,8.12" target="#b20">[19]</ref>. Third order V-splines reproduce polynomials up to degree two (Π ≤2 ). The finite differencing of order 2 is exact over this polynomial space: </p><formula>D 2 ξ f = ∆ 2 ξ f = f (· + ξ) − 2f (·) + f (· − ξ</formula><p>). Therefore, we can employ finite differencing to implement (30) for sampled volumetric dataset as: </p><formula>ν B 2 (x) := 51 32 δ(x) − 19 256 ξ∈B δ(x − ξ) + δ(x + ξ) ν F 2 (x) := 25 16 δ(x) − 3 64 ξ∈F δ(x − ξ) + δ(x + ξ) ν C 2 (x) := 7 4 δ(x) − 1 8 ξ∈C δ(x − ξ) + δ(x + ξ) </formula><formula>(32) </formula><p>This implies that the quasi interpolation can be implemented as an FIR filter where the data at a given sampled point is replaced by a weighted average of data at the neighboring lattice points: </p><formula>f ν B 2 (x) := 51 32 f (x) − 19 256 ξ∈B f (x − ξ) + f (x + ξ) </formula><formula>f ν F 2 (x) := 25 16 f (x) − 3 64 ξ∈F f (x − ξ) + f (x + ξ) </formula><formula>f ν C 2 (x) := 7 4 f (x) − 1 8 ξ∈C f (x − ξ) + f (x + ξ) . </formula><formula>(33) </formula></div>

The ground truth dataset in our experiments are shown in <ref type="figure" coords="7,440.31,297.77,30.40,8.12" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref> that are used for visual and numerical evaluation of reconstruction accuracy. Carp fish and bonsai tree datasets (i.e. non-synthetic data) have been subsampled from a high resolution (256 × 256 × 256) CT dataset to create lower resolution test cases. The low resolution Cartesian (140 × 140 × 140), BCC (111 × 111 × 222) and FCC (88 × 88 × 352) serve as test cases for our comparisons. The synthetic Marschner-Lobb has been directly sampled on comparison lattices, Cartesian (41×41× 41), BCC (32 × 32 × 64) and FCC (25 × 25 × 100). Since having exactly the same resolution for different lattices is not possible, we have chosen volumes with approximately the same resolution while Cartesian ones have slightly higher resolution than the other two. This choice allows us to conservatively examine the increased quality of BCC/FCC sampling against Cartesian sampling. The images in the first column of <ref type="figure" coords="7,430.48,437.34,30.87,8.12">Figure 7</ref>are rendered using V2 without any prefiltering on different lattices, while the second column shows the result of applying quasi interpolation with V-spline for reconstruction . As seen in the images, the rings are better preserved and are visually taller than first column. Reduction of height in the reconstructed rings are due to over-smoothing of the reconstruction ker- nel <ref type="bibr" coords="7,307.24,497.11,14.19,8.12" target="#b35">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,323.61,497.11,10.65,8.12" target="#b40"> 37]</ref>. The quasi interpolation scheme has reduced this problem and has provided a more accurate reconstruction of the rings. In <ref type="figure" coords="7,314.49,517.08,30.84,8.12" target="#fig_4">Figure 8</ref> we have also documented the improvement in the accuracy of ML reconstruction using quasi interpolation by rendering the top view of Marschner-Lobb dataset along with error images. The first row shows reconstruction of ML and the following rows show the rendering of angular error in reconstructing normals of the rendered isosurface. The error encodes the angular difference between the estimated normal and the true normal of the isosurface. Gray scale images visualize the error where the maximum error of .3 radians is mapped to white and zero error is mapped to black. The darker images in the third row confirms the more accurate reconstruction offered by quasi interpolation. While the BCC reconstruction is the most accurate (darkest) among the three, the FCC closely follows in terms of accuracy. However, in terms of aliasing effects, the FCC shows noticeably smaller presence of aliasing in the sampling process. This experiment confirms the theoretical expectations <ref type="bibr" coords="7,395.35,666.56,14.94,8.12" target="#b31">[28] </ref> that the FCC lattice is a good candidate when sampling process has inherent aliasing. We also note that this validation is now possible with the V-splines framework since they give an unbiased reconstruction across these lattices (confirmed by the over-smoothing and post-aliasing measurements in <ref type="figure" coords="7,478.71,706.41,25.18,8.12" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>). In <ref type="figure" coords="7,313.88,716.41,30.21,8.12" target="#fig_5">Figure 9</ref>and <ref type="figure" coords="7,361.68,716.41,34.71,8.12" target="#fig_6">Figure 10</ref>the subsampled versions of carp fish and bonsai tree datasets have been visualized on different lattices using V2.

The left column illustrate the rendering result without applying quasi interpolation and the right one shows the effect of applying quasi interpolation with V-spline reconstruction on Cartesian, BCC and FCC. As shown in the images, the rings in the case of quasi interpolation are taller that demonstrate less over-smoothing. Moreover, the rings are less jagged in the case of BCC and FCC compared to Cartesian case.  correspond to reconstruction without quasi interpolation and the remainings show the effect of applying quasi interpolation. In the case of carp fish dataset, the smoothing artifact is clearly visible in ribs and tails sections in the first row, which is not present in the second row. For bonsai dataset, many branches has been disconnected during the reconstruction while they have been re-connected by the quasi interpolation . In second and forth columns of <ref type="figure" coords="8,170.70,585.01,33.08,8.12" target="#fig_6">Figure 10</ref>, a zoomed in view of bonsai dataset is shown in which a branch is almost preserved by quasi interpolation which is not present in the reconstructions without quasi interpolation. We have also documented the numerical error analysis of quasi interpolation with V2 reconstruction, by measuring mean squared error in the reconstructed signal over the entire volumes used for rendering . We have summarized the results in <ref type="figure" coords="8,167.89,654.81,26.64,8.12" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>which shows that the accuracy of reconstruction has been improved by applying quasi inter- polation. </p></div>

Compared to the orthogonal projection into the spline space the quasi interpolation does not provide the best approximation error for a particular resolution. However, the quasi interpolation scheme, together with the orthogonal projection , asymptotically attain the optimal approximation order that the compactly-supported V-splines can generate; hence, the quasi interpolation scheme can be considered as a computationally efficient alternative to the best approximation. The quasi interpolation methodology along with V-splines provide an unbiased reconstruction framework across different lattices that reduce over-smoothing artifacts in the case of higher order V-splines.

			<note place="foot" n="1"> This special box spline is the tensor-product of the 1-D box function and when used as a convolution kernel leads to piecewise constant interpolation on the Cartesian lattice.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="0"> n+1 times (6) Using the convolution-based definition one can show that Vn+1 is an C n basis function whose approximation order is n + 2, geometrically tailored, for any lattice [34]. V-splines on Cartesian lattice coincide with the tensor product B-splines due to separable nature of Cartesian lattice whose Voronoi cell is a cube. However, characterizing Vsplines for non-Cartesian lattices is challenging due to the complicated geometry of Voronoi cells of non-Cartesian lattices that influence the convolution operation. As discussed in [34], the V-spline framework exploits geometric properties of zonotopes that apply on the Voronoi cells of all lattices. Based on the parallelepiped decomposition of zonotopes, the characterization of self-convolution (6) becomes tractable. [34] derives the relationship between V-splines defined on general lattices and multibox splines that can be used for exact characterization of V-splines. 3 RECONSTRUCTION WITH VORONOI SPLINES Since V-splines are tailor-made for each specific lattice, they generate lattice-shift-invariant (LSI) spaces for approximation. An n th order LSI space generated by linear combination of shifts of a V-spline (i.e., semi-discrete convolution): LSIn : {s | s(x) = c * V L n (x) = k∈LZ 3 c k V L n (x − k)}, (7) where the numbers c k are the coefficients of the spline in the linear combination of lattice-shifted basis functions, V L n . In image processing [35] and volume rendering [32], the spline coefficients c k are often chosen to be the function values at respective points: c k = f (k). Approximation Order One can refine the approximation by scaling the sampling lattice by a scalar h &lt; 1; then, the approximation s h is based on samples that are collected from the scaled lattice hLZ 3 . The approximation order of a spline space generated by shifts of a reconstruction kernel V , is the largest n where f − s h 2 = O(h n ) for all sufficiently smooth functions f . In the case of nth order Vspline on sampling lattice L, the reconstruction kernel is V L n , which in the general case we refer to it as Vn. As proved in [34], the approximation order of the lattice-shift-invariant space generated by Vn is exactly n + 1 for all lattices. Even though the spline space, generated by shifts of a basis function, is capable of approximating functions with certain approximation order, the common choice of spline coefficients (i.e., c k = f (k), does not attain this optimal approximation order.
