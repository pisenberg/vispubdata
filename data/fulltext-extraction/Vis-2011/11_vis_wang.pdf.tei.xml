				<p>Fig. 1. Given point cloud data in high-dimensional space, we detect and visualize branching structures in a neighborhood surrounding a given point of interest. Here we give two simple examples with point clouds sampled from surfaces embedded in 3-dimensional space. In (a), given a genus-3 surface, we analyze the branching structure around one of its corners, x. We apply color-mapping transfer functions to local circle-valued coordinate functions to visualize the structure. Specifically, the color scale indicates the &quot; direction &quot; of the branches. As illustrated in (b), there is a local two-way branching around x, where the coordinate function of each branch is visualized in (c) and (d), respectively. In (e), given a genus-4 surface, we detect a seven-way branching around x (f), where three of the coordinate functions are shown in (g), (h) and (i), respectively. Abstract—Large observations and simulations in scientific research give rise to high-dimensional data sets that present many challenges and opportunities in data analysis and visualization. Researchers in application domains such as engineering, computational biology, climate study, imaging and motion capture are faced with the problem of how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data while preserving their intrinsic structure. In many applications, the original data is projected onto low-dimensional space via dimensionality reduction techniques prior to modeling. One problem with this approach is that the projection step in the process can fail to preserve structure in the data that is only apparent in high dimensions. Conversely, such techniques may create structural illusions in the projection, implying structure not present in the original high-dimensional data. Our solution is to utilize topological techniques to recover important structures in high-dimensional data that contains non-trivial topology. Specifically, we are interested in high-dimensional branching structures. We construct local circle-valued coordinate functions to represent such features. Subsequently, we perform dimensionality reduction on the data while ensuring such structures are visually preserved. Additionally, we study the effects of global circular structures on visualizations. Our results reveal never-before-seen structures on real-world data sets from a variety of applications.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Many scientific investigations depend on exploratory data analysis and visualization of high-dimensional data sets that represent complex phenomena. Given a collection of high-dimensional data points, dimensionality reduction techniques are typically applied prior to modeling and feature detection. These techniques find a low-dimensional representation of the data with simple guarantees, by assuming that real-valued low-dimensional coordinates are sufficient to capture its underlying intrinsic structure. In mathematical terms, given a collection of  points X ∈ R d , dimensionality reduction techniques obtain an embedding that maps a point x = (x 1 , x 2 , ..., x d ) ∈ X to a point y = (y 1 , y 2 , ..., y m ), where m ≪ d, through a set of real-valued coordinate </p><formula>functions φ = (φ 1 , φ 2 , ...φ m ) : X → R, where y i = φ i (x)</formula><p> , with the assumption that the data typically has the topological structure of a convex domain <ref type="bibr" coords="1,338.34,575.28,13.79,8.07" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. However, if the underlying space in high dimension contains nontrivial topology, either globally or locally, dimensionality reduction alone is no longer sufficient to preserve the topology. In <ref type="bibr" coords="1,315.18,606.84,13.79,8.07" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the authors challenge the convex domain assumption in dimensionality reduction through topological analysis. They give a method for computing global circular coordinates and interpreting the results, and illustrate their methods on data sets containing circular structures, such as a circle, an annulus and a torus. In particular, the authors describe a topological procedure that enlarges the class of coordinate functions for dimensionality reduction to include global circle-valued functions, mapping the point cloud to a closed circle: </p><formula>θ : X → S 1 . </formula><p>We extend this work by introducing local circular coordinates by computing persistent local cohomology. As a local coordinate, we give a procedure using relative cohomology to compute a function θ U : U → S 1 from a (small) neighborhood in the point cloud to the closed circle. We observe that these local coordinates produce a natu-ral interpretation as encoding branching behaviors. The acquired coordinates are visualized by applying a color map transfer function. In this paper, we will describe this extension, and also give examples from a number of datasets of both global and local circular coordinates , with interpretations of these coordinates in both the global and local realm. Even though <ref type="bibr" coords="2,116.46,101.04,14.99,8.07" target="#b14">[15] </ref>produced some examples of the global circular coordinate structures, our emphasis will be on less artificial datasets and on the interpretation of the resulting coordinates. There are two advantages to using topologically motivated circlevalued coordinate functions. First, they enrich data representations by revealing branching and circular features in the data. Second, by reflecting topological properties in the high-dimensional embedding domain , they help differentiate intrinsic structure in the data from structural illusions. For example, for a point cloud sampled from a torus embedded in 2D as shown in <ref type="figure" coords="2,80.94,196.56,30.40,8.07" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>(a) and (b), dimensionality techniques alone can always visualize one of its essential loops (generators of the homology groups) represented by θ 1 , while the same techniques fail to showcase the other essential loop as revealed by θ 2 without tearing or cutting. In <ref type="figure" coords="2,74.10,234.72,30.64,8.07" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> (c), (d) and (e), we can see that global circlevalued coordinate functions differentiate a trefoil knot from two linked circles based upon seemingly similar projections. While this differentiation could arguably be performed with clustering techniques, the cohomological approach is more robust to knotting and interleaving of the data sets than a pure clustering technique would have been. On the other hand, local circle-valued coordinate functions reveal topological features within a sub-region of the point cloud, as shown in <ref type="figure" coords="2,32.82,311.04,30.10,8.07" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. It is able to capture the three-way branching structure surrounding the crossing point in figure eight (<ref type="figure" coords="2,198.12,320.64,30.35,8.07" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>(e), (f) and </p><p>(g)), while detecting structural illusion of a figure eight created by projecting a circle in a certain direction (<ref type="figure" coords="2,169.43,339.72,29.39,8.07" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>(b) and (c)). Our main contributions are as follows. @BULLET We introduce local circle-valued coordinate functions that facilitate local structural analysis, especially the detection of branching features in data. We construct these functions in a local neighborhood through topological analysis of 1-dimensional cohomology . That is, we choose a subset of points U that are with close proximity of a given point, and construct coordinate functions θ U : U → S 1 . @BULLET On the technical level, we develop a local version of the persistent cohomology machinery through local cohomology computed on point cloud data. Persistence enables the detection of significant local features and separates features from noise within the data. That is, we obtain a parametrization of U through coordinate functions θ 1 , θ 2 , ..., θ n : U → S 1 , where n indicates the number of significant local features. @BULLET We present the first technique that approximates topological circular and branching structures in high-dimensional space to aid visualization in the low-dimensional projection. @BULLET We present empirical evidence demonstrating that both the local and global circle-valued coordinate functions, for the first time, permit more precise analysis on real-world data sets. This extends the more artificial experiments in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,192.90,552.72,13.70,8.07" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, where emphasis was on proof-of-concept using simulated data sets. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>A variety of nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, mostly spectral approaches, have been proposed in recent years. These spectral methods typically construct an adjacency graph from the point cloud data and compute a pair-wise distance matrix from which eigenvectors are extracted to represent the data in a low dimensional space <ref type="bibr" coords="2,22.50,640.92,13.79,8.07">[36]</ref>. Some of the popular methods include Isomap <ref type="bibr" coords="2,206.58,640.92,13.79,8.07" target="#b42">[46]</ref>, locally linear embedding <ref type="bibr" coords="2,64.62,650.52,13.70,8.07" target="#b39">[43]</ref>, Laplacian eigenmaps <ref type="bibr" coords="2,162.18,650.52,9.51,8.07" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and kernel PCA <ref type="bibr" coords="2,236.58,650.52,13.70,8.07" target="#b40">[44]</ref>. Several nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques have been presented in recent years to analyze and visualize various topological features in high dimensions. Takahashi et al. extract approximate contour trees and Reeb graphs from high-dimensional point samples by introducing new distance metrics to manifold learning techniques such as Isomap <ref type="bibr" coords="2,78.06,707.76,13.79,8.07" target="#b41">[45]</ref> . They use the k-nearest neighbor graph to approximate point-wise proximity.

They first approximate the density function (b) and (c): projection of a circle (b) on 2D (c) that gives an illusion of a figure eight, local circle-valued coordinate function indicates there is no local branching structure. (e), (f) and (g): projection of a figure eight on 2D, three circle-valued coordinate functions are visualized to describe the local branching structures. by sampling on the point cloud's Gabriel graph <ref type="bibr" coords="2,458.34,454.32,13.70,8.07" target="#b28">[31]</ref>, compute its join tree, generate the topological landscape <ref type="bibr" coords="2,434.46,463.92,14.87,8.07" target="#b44">[48] </ref>from the join tree, and finally argument the landscape by placing the original data points at chosen locations <ref type="bibr" coords="2,347.94,483.00,13.79,8.07" target="#b36">[40]</ref>. The technique has been extended and applied successfully in topology-based projection and visualization of high dimensional document point clouds <ref type="bibr" coords="2,420.54,502.08,13.79,8.07" target="#b37">[41]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,444.54,502.08,14.99,8.07" target="#b41">[45] </ref> focuses on preserving topological transitions of level-sets, and <ref type="bibr" coords="2,445.74,511.56,14.87,8.07" target="#b37">[41] </ref>studies the structure of data in terms of dense regions, while our work emphasizes local branching and global circular structure detection in high dimensions that are not necessarily captured by the above techniques. In particular , our work introduces new localized mapping of high-dimensional point cloud data for the analysis of branching structures. Various algorithms have been proposed to compute loops on surfaces , or homology generators that satisfy certain geometric optimality <ref type="bibr" coords="2,285.06,589.20,14.24,8.07" target="#b26">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,301.14,589.20,11.24,8.07" target="#b11"> 12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,314.10,589.20,11.24,8.07" target="#b47"> 51,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,327.18,589.20,10.68,8.07"> 26]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,343.98,589.20,14.99,8.07" target="#b26">[29] </ref>computes shortest set of homology generators for 2-manifolds. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,333.66,598.80,14.87,8.07" target="#b18">[19] </ref>uses topological persistence <ref type="bibr" coords="2,453.42,598.80,14.87,8.07" target="#b24">[25] </ref> to computes topologically correct loops on surfaces, that wrap around their " handles " and " tunnels " .

In terms of revealing circular structures or essential loops within data, several approaches have been taken to find alternative representa- tions. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,307.50,696.84,14.99,8.07" target="#b20">[21] </ref>studies cylindrical manifolds, data whose generative model includes a cyclic and a linear parameter, and tries to find embedding functions that map them onto a cylinder S 1 × R. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,470.82,717.24,14.87,8.07" target="#b33">[37] </ref>projects data with non-trivial topology by destroying essential loops via tearing and cutting. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,315.06,736.32,14.87,8.07" target="#b38">[42] </ref>maps data to a pre-chosen non-flat target space, such as a cylinder or a sphere, using multidimensional scaling. In <ref type="bibr" coords="3,51.30,63.00,13.79,8.07" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the authors present a framework of persistent cohomology, and demonstrates how a correspondence from homotopy theory enables the construction of circle-valued coordinate functions from cohomology classes. In this work, persistence aids the construction by providing a quality measure for the cohomology classes and thus also for the corresponding circle-valued coordinates. From this framework emerges coordinate functions for dimensionality reduction that respect and reflect the original topology of the high-dimensional embedding, while highlighting such structures in the data that can be continuously mapped onto the circle. Recent work in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,100.74,158.64,10.43,8.07" target="#b7">[8] </ref> defines a modified version of topological persistence (level persistence) for 1-cocycles, and shows that such 1- cocycles can be interpreted as a circle valued map. While both <ref type="bibr" coords="3,266.94,177.72,14.99,8.07" target="#b14">[15] </ref>and <ref type="bibr" coords="3,46.98,187.20,10.55,8.07" target="#b7">[8] </ref> discuss circle-valued functions, we notice that the papers differ fundamentally in approach and in the notion of persistence used.

Compared to these bodies of previous work, our paper is the first that constructs local circle-valued coordinates on high-dimensional data sets using persistent local cohomology, and is the first to observe the connections to branching structures. We discover and visualize topological structures such as circles and branches on some data sets that have never been realized before. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</head><p> Our algorithm has key ingredients from both algebra, topology, and algorithmics .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Homology and cohomology</head><p>Homology. Homology deals with topological features such as " holes " or " cycles " ; 0-, 1-and 2-dimensional homology groups correspond to components, tunnels and voids in a topological space. Here, we discuss its simplest and most concrete definition, at the level of simplicial homology. Consider the simplicial complex K pictured in <ref type="figure" coords="3,210.30,480.84,29.14,8.07" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>, which is a triangulation of an annulus. The 0-, 1-and 2-simplexes in K are the vertices, edges and triangles, denoted by the sets K </p><formula>0 = {v i }, K 1 = {e i } and K 2 = {∆ i } </formula><p>respectively. We assume all simplices are oriented. We define the 0-chains, 1-chains and 2-chains as formal sums of 0-, 1-and 2-simplexes with integer coefficients, respectively, </p><formula>C 0 = C 0 (K; Z) = {b = ∑ g i v i | g i ∈ Z}, C 1 = C 1 (K; Z) = {a = ∑ g i e i | g i ∈ Z}, C 2 = C 2 (K; Z) = {c = ∑ g i ∆ i | g i ∈ Z}. </formula><p>By abuse of notation, each 0-, 1-and 2-simplex in K corresponds to an elementary chain of the same dimension. Then 0-, 1-and 2-chains can be considered as sums of elementary chains. Here, the 0-chain b 1 is </p><formula>∂ 2 ([v 0 , v 1 , v 2 ]) = [v 1 , v 2 ] − [v 0 , v 2 ] + [v 0 , v 1 ]. ∂ 1 ([v 0 , v 1 ]) = v 1 − v 0 . </formula><p>It is easy to verify that ∂ @BULLET ∂ = 0. For instance, Consider the torus, in the triangulation K in <ref type="figure" coords="3,468.18,341.76,30.88,8.07" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref>top left, the 1-homology group is generated by the 1-chains a 1 (red) and a 2 (blue), that is, </p><formula>∂ @BULLET ∂ (∆ 1 ) = ∂ (∂ ([v 4 , v 5 , v 6 ])) = ∂ ([v 5 , v 6 ] − [v 4 , v 6 ] + [v 4 , v 5 ]) = ∂ ([v 5 , v 6 ]) − ∂ ([v 4 , v 6 ]) + ∂ ([v 4 , v 5 ]) = v 6 − v 5 − (v 6 − v 4 ) + v 5 − v 4 = 0. Let a ∈ C 1 . </formula><formula>a 1 = [a, b] + [b, c] + [c, a] and a 2 = [a, d] + [d, e] + [e, a]</formula><p>. We can verify that both a 1 and a 2 are 1-cycles, as ∂ (a 1 ) = ∂ (a 2 ) = 0. They are not 1-boundaries since neither ∂ (b) = a 1 nor ∂ (b) = a 2 admit a solution b ∈ C 2 . In addition, a 1 and a 2 are not homologous. Cohomology. Now we associate to K another sequence of groups called cohomology groups, whose origins lie in algebra rather than geometry <ref type="bibr" coords="3,329.82,418.08,13.79,8.07" target="#b35">[39]</ref>. In many ways, they are considered " dual " to homology groups, and are important in practice. Consider our example in <ref type="figure" coords="3,392.82,437.28,28.54,8.07" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>, cohomology deals with functions on 0-, 1-and 2-chain groups. By abuse of notation, each 0-, 1-and 2- dimensional simplex in K corresponds to an elementary cochain of the same dimension. For example, the 1-simplex e has a corresponding elementary 1-cochain e * , which is a function on 1-chain whose value is 1 on e and 0 on all other edges. In other words, </p><formula>e * : C 1 → Z, where e * (e) = 1 and e * (e ′ ) = 0 for all e ′ ∈ K 1 , e ′ = e. </formula><p>Similarly, we have elementary 0-cochains, v * associated with the 0-simplices v; and elementary 2-cochains ∆ * associated with the 2-simplices ∆. 0-, 1-and 2-cochains can be considered as sums of elementary cochains, that is, </p><formula>C 0 = C 0 (K; Z) = {β : C 0 → Z, β = ∑ g i v * i | g i ∈ Z}, C 1 = C 1 (K; Z) = {α : C 1 → Z, α = ∑ g i e * i | g i ∈ Z}, C 2 = C 2 (K; Z) = {γ : C 2 → Z, γ = ∑ g i ∆ * i | g i ∈ Z}. </formula><p>The boundary maps from homology give us an accessible way to build higher-dimensional cochains from lower-dimensional ones. In order to find a value of a new k-cochain on a k-simplex σ we could compute the values of a known (k − 1)-cochain on the boundary ∂ σ and accumulate these values. This suggests a definition, dual to the boundary map, that we call the coboundary map, </p><formula>δ 0 : C 0 → C 1 , δ 1 : C 1 → C 2 , </formula><formula>(δ 0 β )([v 0 , v 1 ]) = β (∂ 1 ([v 0 , v 1 ]) = β (v 1 ) − β (v 0 ), (δ 1 α)([v 0 , v 1 , v 2 ]) = α(∂ 2 ([v 0 , v 1 , v 2 ])) = = α([v 1 , v 2 ]) − α([v 0 , v 2 ]) + α([v 0 , v 1 ]). </formula><p> These notations are convenient in computing coboundaries. For example , If </p><formula>α = ∑ g i e * i , then δ (α) = ∑ g i (δ e * i ). To compute δ e * for </formula><p>each oriented simplex e, we have δ e * = ∑ ε j ∆ * j , where the summation extends over all ∆ j having e as a face, and ε j = ±1 is the coefficient with which e appears in the expression for ∂ ∆ j . A similar rule applies to computing δ v * . In analogy to the treatment of homology above, for a cochain α ∈ C 1 , we call α a 1-cocycle if δ 1 (α) = 0. We call α a 1-coboundary if there exists a cochain β ∈ C 0 such that δ 0 (β ) = 0. It is easy to verify that δ @BULLET δ = 0. 1-coboundaries are always 1-cocycles, we have im (δ 0 ) ⊆ ker (δ 1 ). We define the 1-cohomology of K to be the quotient group, H 1 = H 1 (K; Z) = ker (δ 1 )/im (δ 0 ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Local cohomology</head><p> The notation H 1 (X, Y) is commonly referred to as relative cohomology , which is closely connected to the computation of the cohomology groups of the quotient space X/Y. Intuitively, when gluing all points in Y to a formally introduced dummy vertex w, any non-trivial topology within Y is destroyed, ensuring that H 1 (X, Y) only cares about topological features that are in X and not in Y. Suppose we have a topological space X. We may define the 1- dimensional local homology group of X at a point x ∈ X as H 1 (X, X − x) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,32.70,657.12,13.79,8.07" target="#b35">[39]</ref>. In analogy, the 1-dimensional local cohomology group of X is a corresponding relative cohomology group H 1 (X, X − x). Fixing some sufficiently small radius r, using the axiom of excision, we can define the above local homology group as H 1 </p><formula>(X ∩ B r (x), X ∩ ∂ B r (x)</formula><p>), where B r (x) denotes the ball of radius r centered around x, and ∂ B r (x) denotes its boundary. With the same analogy, we may define the 1- dimensional local cohomology group to be H 1 (X∩B r (x), X∩∂ B r (x)). This local cohomology group computes topological features of X within a local neighborhood B r (x), hence the term local cohomology.  In the discretized setting of simplicial complexes, these local cohomology groups are approximated in Section 5. To put the above formal definition into context, see <ref type="figure" coords="4,482.46,288.96,30.40,8.07" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref>(left). The space X is an annulus. Given a point x ∈ X and a radius r, we draw a ball of radius r around x. The space that is inside the ball is X ∩ B r (x) (pink shaded region), and the space that is on the boundary is X ∩ ∂ B r (x) (black). This allows us to compute H 1 </p><formula>(X ∩ B r (x), X ∩ ∂ B r (x)). </formula></div>

Let [X, S 1 ] be the set of equivalence classes of continuous maps from space X to S 1 under the homotopy relation. For topological spaces with the homotopy type of a cell complex, there is an isomorphism <ref type="bibr" coords="4,285.06,571.68,13.79,8.07" target="#b31">[34]</ref> .

We shall assume that we can represent point cloud data X by a simplicial complex K containing vertices, edges and triangles. 1- dimensional cohomology classes consist of integer-valued functions on the edges of this complex. By the isomorphism above, non-trivial global 1-cohomology classes correspond to circular or cyclical structures while local 1-cohomology classes correspond to branching structure in the data underlying the point cloud. </p><formula>H 1 (X; Z) ∼ = [X, S 1 ] </formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">OVERVIEW</head><p>With the technical tools described early, we now give an overview of our algorithm. We detect branching structures by computing local circular coordinates. Given a point cloud X and a point of interest x ∈ X, we choose a subset U ⊆ X ⊂ R d in the neighborhood of x, and output local circular coordinate functions θ : U → S 1 , that give the values for points in the neighborhood of x. Our overall pipeline is as follows: 1. Compute a simplicial complex K from the point cloud data X in the local neighborhood of x. 2. Use our local persistent cohomology to detect a significant cohomology class <ref type="bibr" coords="5,100.50,368.16,15.09,9.56">[α p ] </ref>in the data: </p><formula>[α p ] ∈ H 1 (K, F p )</formula><p>, where F p is the field of integers modulo a fixed prime p. </p><formula>3.

Encode each local circular coordinates with a color map transfer function to highlight true structures and rule out structural illusions. </p><p>Here, step 1 adapts and build upon previous work, and step 2 is our own development. Step 3 uses well-established procedures in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,252.06,480.00,14.87,8.07" target="#b14">[15] </ref>and step 4 introduces approximations of circular and branching structures to help visualization. We find it useful in practice as demonstrated in Section 6. Branching behaviors. Branching is a phenomenon we observe in structures that are locally approximately 1-dimensional. We define a branching point to be a point at which any path leading in along some locally 1-dimensional structure has some number of different paths leading out again. Consider the example illustrated in <ref type="figure" coords="5,230.82,556.44,29.50,8.07" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref>. The pink regions above and below both decompose into approximately 1- dimensional components. However, in the top figure, there is only one such component leading out, and in the bottom, there are three. We call a point a k-way branching point if it is the point where k + 1 such 1-dimensional components merge. The fundamental observation in this paper is that we can detect k-way branching by observing a local cohomology group of rank k, and that the resulting local circle-valued coordinates form a basis for the space spanned by the different possible branches. These basis elements often, though not always, immediately correspond to the distinct branches in the data set. , to compute local cohomology of a space X at a point x, we compute H 1 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">ALGORITHM</head><formula>(X ∩ B r (x), X ∩ ∂ B r (x)</formula><p>) for some appropriate fixed radius r. To approximate this situation simplicially, we introduce – for a simplicial complex K representing the point cloud – two new simplicial complexes K ′ and L ′ . K ′ consists of all simplices σ of K such that either some vertices of σ are contained in B r (x), or σ is a face of such a simplex. L ′ consists of all simplices σ of K ′ such that no vertices are contained in B r (x). We note that if K is in fact a parametrized family of complexes K(ε), then we define K ′ (ε) and L ′ (ε) correspondingly: by picking out appropriate simplices in K(ε) for the definitions of K ′ (ε) and L ′ (ε) respectively. For a simplicial complex K and a formally introduced dummy point w, we define the cone on K with vertex w, denoted CK, to be the simplicial complex whose simplices are of the form [w, v 0 , . . . , v p ] or [v 0 , . . . , <ref type="bibr" coords="5,322.02,158.76,10.89,9.56">v p ] </ref>for each (possibly empty) simplex [v 0 , . . . , v p ] of K <ref type="bibr" coords="5,527.34,159.36,13.70,8.07" target="#b30">[33]</ref>. We call K the base of the cone. Relative cohomology groups can be interpreted as the absolute cohomology groups of an associated simplicial complex <ref type="bibr" coords="5,491.34,188.52,13.79,8.07" target="#b30">[33]</ref>. By using the excision theorem, it follows that Given a collection of data points X with some distance metric, such as the L 2 , Hamming or Edit distances , there are a number of popular ways to represent the data set as a simplicial complex. We can extract a representation of local information in each of these cases, by constructing K ′ ∪CL ′ from K ′ and L ′ induced from an appropriate simplicial representation. While there are ways to generate a single simplicial complex to represent a point cloud, the more useful approach has been to generate a nested family of simplicial complexes <ref type="bibr" coords="5,452.22,353.64,13.79,8.07" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In our work, we use the Vietoris-Rips complex Rips (X, ε), which includes a p-simplex for every finite set of p + 1 points in X with diameter at most ε. Since we are only interested in H 1 , we can restrict our attention to the 2- skeleton of Rips (X, ε). For a sequence ε 1 ≤ ε 2 ≤ · · · ≤ ε n , we obtain a nested family of simplicial complexes Rips (X, ε 1 ) ⊆ Rips (X, ε 2 ) ⊆ · · · ⊆ Rips (X, ε n ). For larger data sets, the witness complex construction may be more appropriate, as it tends to be smaller <ref type="bibr" coords="5,491.34,421.80,13.79,8.07" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Na¨ıvelyNa¨ıvely we can now compute K ′ (ε i ) ∪ CL ′ (ε i ) induced from Rips (X, ε i ) by the conditions stated above. However, it is enough to compute Rips (X ∩ B r+ε i (x), ε i ) instead, since all simplices of K ′ (ε i ) ∪ CL ′ (ε i ) are contained in a r + ε i neighborhood of x. The resulting </p><formula>H 1 (K ′ , L ′ ) ∼ = H 1 (K ′ ∪CL ′ ). This complex K ′ ∪CL ′ </formula><formula>K(ε i ) = K ′ (ε i ) ∪ CL ′ (ε i </formula><p>) is a nested family of simplicial complexes that reflects local behavior around x. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Persistence cohomology in its local version</head><p>At step 2 of the algorithm, we are given a nested family of simplicial complexes that represent the local structure at different parameter values ε. We introduce the notion of scale for learning this local structure through the concept of persistence. Persistence studies the evolution of vectors in a sequence of vector spaces <ref type="bibr" coords="5,445.14,545.40,13.70,8.07" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. One main example of such a sequence comes from relating the cohomologies of simplicial complexes reflecting different scales. With persistence we can rank the significance of cohomology classes, and gain robustness in our proposed methods. Formally, letting K i = K(ε i ) as constructed above, we are given a nested family of simplicial complexes connected by inclusions, K : K 1 → K 2 → ... → K n . For ε i ≤ ε j , the inclusion of spaces K i ⊆ K j induces a map between cohomology groups, f : </p><formula>H 1 (K j ) → H 1 (K i )</formula><p>, and we consider the sequence, </p><formula>H 1 (K 1 ) ← H 1 (K 2 ) ← . . . ← H 1 (K n ). A class α ∈ H 1 (K a </formula><p>) is born at the time a if it appears for the first time as a cohomology class, and such a class dies entering H 1 (K b ) when it disappears as a cohomology class. We call ε b − ε a the persistence of α. We consider classes with high persistence as representing significant topological structure. It is important to note here that we compute H 1 (K 1 ) = H 1 (K 1 ; F p ) with coefficients in F p . As observed in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,294.06,707.76,13.79,8.07" target="#b46">[50]</ref>, persistence as a characterization of topological features relies on the coefficients being a field. Computing over a finite field F p allows for fast arithmetic, and any free cohomology classes over Z will still be classes over F p . As described in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,429.18,736.32,13.79,8.07" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, if the computation detects classes that do not correspond to free classes over Z, the smoothing step will fail to converge. In this case, <ref type="bibr" coords="6,165.42,189.36,14.99,8.07" target="#b14">[15] </ref>recommend that the user re-run the computation with a different prime. Any classes that occur over both primes are guaranteed to be free. Intuitively, persistence separates topological features from noise by measuring, in a sense, their size. An illustrative example is shown in <ref type="figure" coords="6,32.10,237.12,30.52,8.07" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref>where the global circle-valued coordinate function on the left corresponds to a persistent, or significant circular structure, while the circle-valued coordinate function on the right might be considered noise. We give topological methods to detect branching or circular structures in point clouds, and use persistence to detect their signifi- cance. The algorithm that computes persistent cohomology of a sequence of simplicial complexes is a modified version of the persistent homology algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="6,74.70,313.68,14.12,8.07" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,90.78,313.68,10.68,8.07" target="#b9"> 10]</ref>, which in turn is a variation of the classic Smith normal form algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="6,106.98,323.16,13.79,8.07" target="#b35">[39]</ref> . In a nutshell, it involves a specific ordering of matrix reduction steps on the coboundary matrices of the nested simplicial complexes. After reducing the matrix we obtain a collection of cocycles, each of which is represented as a set of edges together with their function values. For a detailed treatment and discussion of the persistent cohomology algorithm, see <ref type="bibr" coords="6,172.38,370.92,13.79,8.07" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Lifting, smoothing and integration</head><p> For step 3 of our algorithm, we are given a collection of cocycles obtained from step 2. Each cocycle is represented as a collection of edges with coefficients in F p . We then lift the coefficients first to the integers (Z) and then to the reals (R). Once the cocycle is a real cochain, we can smooth the corresponding function, and then integrate to produce a function from vertices compatible with the given values on edges. These steps are detailed in <ref type="bibr" coords="6,122.46,459.00,13.70,8.07" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Here we shall review some of their key ideas, for easier reference. Lifting. Given α p , we lift α p to α, from F p coefficient to integer coefficient. We lift </p><formula>α p = ∑ n i e * i to α = ∑ g i e * i , where g i is the unique integer in [−(p − 1)/2, (p − 1)/2] congruent to n i . </formula><p>Smoothing. Given α, we find the " smoothest " cocycle ¯ α ∈ C 1 (K; R) that is cohomologous to α. By smoothness we mean that ¯ α has a small total variation defined as || ¯ </p><formula>α|| 2 = ∑ e∈K 1 | ¯ α(e)| 2 . α and ¯ α are cohomologous if there exists a f ∈ C 0 (K; R) such that ¯ α − α = δ 0 f . </formula><p>Therefore, we obtain ¯ α by solving the following minimization </p><formula>lem: ¯ α = arg min ¯ α {|| ¯ α|| 2 | ¯ α − α = δ 0 f , ∃ f ∈ C 0 (K; R)}. </formula><p>Integration. We can integrate ¯ α brute force, by picking a point on each component (typically including the cone point) to have coordinate value 0, and then setting θ (b) = θ (a) + ¯ α (<ref type="bibr" coords="6,193.73,588.96,17.65,8.97">[a, b]</ref> ) to update a vertex b based on the value of a vertex a and an edge <ref type="bibr" coords="6,200.94,598.56,16.57,8.97">[a, b]</ref>. This defines a function θ on the vertices. Alternatively, as pointed out in <ref type="bibr" coords="6,231.06,608.64,13.79,8.07" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, such a function θ comes out of the smoothing step above as the f minimizing ¯ α, modulo Z. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Generator approximations</head><p> To aid visualization, we provide two methods to give a fast approximation to ¯ α, the cocycle generator cohomologous to α. Due to the highdimensionality and complexity of the data, often many data points may map to the same value on S 1 , or close in parametrization by a small ε. Therefore tracing out all edges with non-zero coefficient in ¯ α can lead to a messy visualization when projected onto a lower dimensional space. One fast and simple approximation of ¯ α computes a minimum weight cycle which spans bins of values. Here we assume a binning of parametrized values, where points lie in a common bin if their distance (difference in value) is less than a predetermined value. Bins are ordered according to their values with respect to S 1 . Between two neighboring bins, we assumes a complete graph where all pair-wise edges across bins are possible, with edge weights reflecting value differences at their end nodes. Our problem reduces to computing a minimum weight cycle across all bins. We demonstrate in Section 6 that even this simple approximation reveals much information on the structure of the parametrization. On the other hand, we know that ¯ α must operate on edges of the underlying Vietoris-Rips complex. Therefore we can augment the minimum weight cycle approximation to enforce this constraint. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Algorithm summary</head><p> The algorithm described above detects local 1-cocycles with the following highlights. First, computing local cohomology groups can be approximated by coning operations on Vietoris-Rips complexes. Second , persistent cohomology detects significant features from noise. Third, the above procedure leads to a local circular parametrization that emphasizes branching structure. Last but not least, generator approximations correspond to approximating circular and branching structures in high dimensions to aid visualization. It is important to note that these branching and circular structures are detected in the high dimensional space via cohomology computation. We only use dimensionality reduction techniques overlaying color-mapped coordinate functions to visualize them in their low dimensional projections. Furthermore, we can construct circle-valued coordinate functions locally even if topology is trivial globally. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Surfaces embedded in R 3</head><p> We test our methods on several synthetic data sets with known branching structures.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Motion capture data</head><p> For this example, we construct both global and local circular coordinates on a couple of motion capture data sets freely distributed online . Motion capture data is the recorded movement of a live actor over time. In the following we show that there are interesting features captured by our methods that are worth further investigation. For our testing, we have analyzed motion capture data saved in the Biovision BVH format. BVH is a hierarchical set of relative joint angles rooted at a node that is traditionally centered at the hips of the live actor. All translational motion of the actor in world space is also encoded at this node, to give a complete representation of the motion. Since the space for translational motion is small, finding circular structure due to this motion should not be difficult. A much more interesting problem is finding structure and correlation in the joint angles, therefore the translational motion is ignored in our testing. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,161.10,488.04,14.87,8.07" target="#b32">[35] </ref> involves a female actor walking , hopping over an obstacle and then walking again. It contains 189 frames with 66 joint angles per frame. For our tests, each frame is considered a point in 66 dimensional space with a L 2 distance metric. <ref type="figure" coords="7,31.50,526.20,34.48,8.07" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> shows this point set embedded onto 3D Euclidean space using Laplacian eigenmaps. This 3D embedding appears to reveal some branching structure, denoted in the top image of this figure. Contrary to this, the local circle-valued coordinate functions computed in high dimension indicate that it is a visual illusion, shown in the rest of images . This example emphasizes the fact that traditional dimensionality reduction can introduce structure where none is present. Local circlevalued coordinates do not suffer from this flaw and therefore can help uncouple illusions from actual structure in visualizations. This local cocycle took 0.08 seconds to compute (0.08 for Rips calculation, persistence calculation timing is negligible). Ballet dancer. The Ballet dancer data set, obtained from <ref type="bibr" coords="7,237.18,631.44,9.60,8.07" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, involves a ballet dancer performing a traditional stretch. The dataset contains 471 frames of 54 joint angles. A sub-sampled (every 2nd frame) compilation of the frames is shown in <ref type="figure" coords="7,174.78,660.00,35.32,8.07" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref>top. In this figure, time flows in row-major order first from left to right then top to bottom by rows. We construct global circle-valued coordinate functions on the data. The parameterized value bins for the second largest 1- cocycle in terms of persistence is drawn over the frames of <ref type="figure" coords="7,247.02,698.16,34.84,8.07" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref>top. As this shows, the cycles coincide with the points of the motion data where there is hesitation or pauses before a point of inflection in the arm movement, see <ref type="figure" coords="7,129.78,726.84,35.32,8.07" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref>bottom right. Additionally, the global-circular coordinates give a binning of similar motions in this (c): when we visualize local-circle valued coordinate functions in the same neighborhood, we obtain two independent parametrizations. This indicates that no branching structures exist in that local neighborhood. We approximate the generators associated with the local cohomology classes to aid visualization of the circular structure. The approximated generator travels along a given branch where the color indicates its direction. Notice that there are extra edges pointed by arrows that are artifacts from the approximation. The red arrow in (c) shows that our sample point no longer has a distinct value in the parametrization. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5">Voting</head><p>Consider the House of Representatives of the US Congress. In a given session, a number of votes are being cast on proposed bills in the House, and a simple numeric scheme can be used to assign values +1, −1, 0 to votes of Yea, votes of Nay and absence of a vote. This yields a point cloud of representatives in a vector space of rollcalls . We study vote records extracted from house.gov that cover the voting behaviors of Democrats in the House of Representatives In <ref type="figure" coords="8,43.74,642.96,34.65,8.07" target="#fig_2">Figure 14</ref>, we see that the most significant circular structure is formed using representatives Deal (D-GA), Laughlin (D-TX), and Reynolds (D-IL), who switched political affiliation or resigned during the year (marked with red arrows in the figure), as well as two tails from the core of the point cloud. This circular structure likely indicates that in addition to resignation or party switches, there are several modes in which a representative can differ from the mainstream of their party. Beyond not agreeing with their own party, representatives can seem absent through having heavy political duties or being absent from their work for other reasons. This cycle took 94.27 seconds to compute (92.15 for Rips calculation, 1.76 for persistence calculation). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6">Combustion and climate simulations</head><p>Advanced modeling and simulation tools have been used recently to reduce the need for large, expensive integrated physical and chemical experiments. As these simulations become more sophisticated and accurate, it becomes crucial to estimate the likelihood of a given prediction and quantify its uncertainty. Topological tools have been helpful in handling parameter choices and an analysis of the parameter spaces related to a simulation <ref type="bibr" coords="8,395.10,639.84,13.70,8.07" target="#b29">[32]</ref>. We believe that topological tools in general, and the analysis of global circular structures in particular, are helpful as feedback for domain scientists that provide extra information useful for uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis. We demonstrate here that within simulation data from both combustion simulations and climate simulations, there are significantly large circular structures present. Combustion simulation. We use a subset of points from a combustion simulation and analyze its output parameter space. Points are located on a 16 by 16 grid with 4 simulation time steps. Each point is considered 16 dimensional, including parameters such as mixture fraction, dissipation rate, heat release rate and temperature. We embedded the points into 3D using Isomap and visualized the significant circular features in the data. This is shown in <ref type="figure" coords="9,160.50,72.48,33.69,8.07" target="#fig_3">Figure 15</ref>. This cycle took 17.04 seconds to compute (11.66 for Rips calculation, 2.96 for persistence calculation). Climate simulation. We are also interested in finding features in the output parameter space of a climate simulation. This data set comprises 1612 simulation points, each with 8 output parameters, including total cloud percentage, precipitation rate, sea-level pressure, surface stress and temperature . We construct global circle-valued coordinate functions and visualize them in Landmark Isomap 3D projection. This is shown in <ref type="figure" coords="9,94.02,158.40,33.45,8.07" target="#fig_4">Figure 16</ref>, where the significant circular structure is concentrated at the basin of the projection. This cycle took 0.09 seconds to compute (0.05 for Rips calculation, 0.02 for persistence calculation ). For this particular cycle, its birth time is low compared to the range of function values. Therefore, the calculation is very efficient due to needing only a small Rips complex to fully capture the cocycle. These global circle-valued coordinates indicate potential non-local correlations among simulation parameters since they indicate high dimensional path along which they may be changed in different ways to achieve the same conditions. This type of non-local correlations are challenging to find and provide insight to the scientists on the complexities of their simulations. We will work with domain scientists to validate the consequences that the emergence of such cycles implies. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.7">Feasibility, performance and limitations</head><p> We shall discuss the runtime complexities of each step in our algo- rithm: @BULLET Step 1: computing the 2-skeleton of the Vietoris-Rips complex. For ε = ∞, the complex has O(v 3 ) simplices (by choosing all possible triangles), where v is the number of vertices. Generating the complex takes time worst case O(v 3 ), this is however rare in practice <ref type="bibr" coords="9,82.50,366.00,13.79,8.07" target="#b45">[49]</ref>. Usually, ε is chosen with prior knowledge of the problem domain to be just large enough to detect the topology. This decreases the above bound to an expected linear or even constant behavior. When computing local cohomology, we only need to construct the complex in the (r + ε)-neighborhood of a center point, which radically reduces the v generating runtime complexity. @BULLET Step 2: computing (local) persistence cohomology. The persistence algorithm runs in time O(n 3 ), where n is the number of simplices <ref type="bibr" coords="9,88.62,453.60,13.79,8.07" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. It shows a roughly linear behavior in practice <ref type="bibr" coords="9,51.42,463.20,9.51,8.07" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. @BULLET Step 3: solving a LSQR optimization problem, which generally has low-complexity and is unlikely the performance bottleneck. The ambient dimension plays a role in the computation of metrics, possibly as a pre-processing step. The rest of the algorithm is independent of the ambient dimension (or even the notion of a well-defined embedding space). In terms of locating points of interest for branching detection, we assume that the prior knowledge suggests a set of candidate points. If not, the computation can be performed on a random sample, retaining any points that show an unexpected high rank for its dimension-1 local cohomology. Our computation includes two user-specified parameters: the size of the neighborhood r and the maximal bound on the persistence parameter ε. While ε can be chosen as indicated in <ref type="bibr" coords="9,205.26,599.76,13.70,8.07" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, keeping in mind that a too small r will miss the local structure, and a too large r may involve disjoint parts of the data set. Our method captures continuous occurrences of circular structures (or branching structures) within a given data set. If the data set does not reflect such structures, that is, its 1-dimension (local) cohomology has rank 0, then no continuous circle-valued functions exist. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">DISCUSSIONS</head><p>We consider our work as a first step towards a more ambitious goal of combining dimensionality reduction with local or regionalized topological analysis of intrinsic structure. Our local circle-valued coordinate functions are similar to local dimensionality estimation in a way that they reflect detailed structural information which might have global effects. We ask the following questions: how do the local and global structures of data interact with one another? How can local analysis infer global structure? There are various open questions, and we address a few here. Shortest local cocycle. Many algorithms exist to compute 1-cycles with geometric constraints, such as shortest by length or minimum by weight. Are these algorithm extendable to compute the shortest (local) 1-cocycles? The smoothing step described earlier obtains a 1-cocycle with minimum total variance. While persistent homology computes representative homology-generating cycles, these cycles can fluctuate drastically due to changes in the filtration or in the simplicial complex. Work in <ref type="bibr" coords="9,361.38,148.80,10.55,8.07" target="#b8">[9] </ref>tracks these cycles so that the changes are local with temporal coherence. We believe this line of work can be extended to (local) persistence cohomology computations. Extending local parametrization. Using our algorithm, a point set U ⊆ X in the r-neighborhood of x ∈ X is parameterized by a circle-valued coordinate function θ : U → S 1 . We can extend such a parametrization by gradually increasing r until non-trivial topological changes take place. That is, we can extend θ : U → S 1 to θ ′ : U ′ → S 1 where U ⊆ U ′ . We can also obtain a partial ordering of all points in X by concatenating multiple local parametrizations. That is, given two circle-valued functions θ 1 : </p><formula>U 1 → S 1 and θ 2 : U 2 → S 1 , where U 1 ∩U 2 = / 0</formula><p>, it might be possible to construct a gluing θ : U 1 ∪U 2 → S 1 in a coherent manner. The notion of 1-cocycle is not only important in our context of circular coordinates, but also shows up in data ranking and discrete vector fields <ref type="bibr" coords="9,388.86,286.32,9.51,8.07" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Does a total partial ordering obtained from " gluing " local 1-cocycles play a role in data ranking? Computation efficiency. To guarantee theoretical correctness in computing local (co)homology, we need to use the Delaunay complex as detailed in <ref type="bibr" coords="9,333.18,324.48,9.80,8.07" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,344.82,324.48,6.45,8.07" target="#b6"> 7]</ref> . However it is impractical to compute Delaunay complexes in high dimensions. We believe that using Vietoris-Rips or witness complexes to compute local cohomology in high dimensions is the best available option. In particular, methods for fast constructions of Vietoris-Rips complexes have become available <ref type="bibr" coords="9,477.66,362.64,13.70,8.07" target="#b45">[49]</ref>, and there has been theoretical advancement on the topology-preserving qualities of Vietoris-Rips complexes <ref type="bibr" coords="9,385.38,381.84,9.51,8.07" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Efficient data structure for representing and simplifying simplicial complexes in high dimension has been pro- posed <ref type="bibr" coords="9,317.46,400.92,9.51,8.07" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Other proximity graph constructions, such as the k-nearest neighbor graph or the Gabriel graph might be employed as well. The correctness guarantee associated with these constructions remains as an open question. <ref type="figure" coords="9,319.86,448.56,32.85,8.07" target="#fig_4">Figure 16</ref> , the default projection and viewing angles can not visualize the circular structures clearly. We obtain better visualization on these structures by approximating cocycles in high dimensional space and choose proper viewing angles, using the algorithm presented in Section 5.4. However, augmenting a low-dimensional projection with color maps still suffers visual drawbacks as some structural information can be hidden. We believe it is an interesting open question to develop visualization techniques that preserve and emphasize topological structures recovered in high-dimensions. In other words, we would like to develop topology-driven or feature-optimized projection in terms of found branches or cycles. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,285.06,195.88,250.31,7.37;2,285.06,205.36,250.36,7.37;2,285.06,212.40,53.47,10.53;2,338.58,212.40,31.75,10.66;2,370.38,214.84,165.06,8.22;2,285.06,224.20,237.18,7.37"><head>Fig. 2. </head><figDesc>Fig. 2.

It is a 1-boundary if it is the boundary of some 2-chain c, that is, ∂ (c) = a. Let ker ∂ 1 denote the set of all 1-cycles and im ∂ 2 denote the set of all 1-boundaries. Since the 1- boundaries are always 1-cycles, im ∂ 2 ⊆ ker ∂ 1 . The 1-homology of K is the quotient group, H 1 = H 1 (K; Z) = ker ∂ 1 /im ∂ 2 . For example, a 1 (bold red) is a 1-cycle since ∂ (a 1 ) = 0. a 2 = e 9 + e 10 + e 11 + e 12 (bold cyan) is a 1-boundary since it is the boundary of the 2-chain c 1 . a 1 is a 1-cycle, but not a 1-boundary, which makes [a 1 ] a non-trivial element of H 1 . Therefore a 1 can be used as a representative of the homology class that generates the first homology group of K. Two elements a, a ′ ∈ C 1 are homologous iff a − a ′ = ∂ (c), for some 2-chain c, denoted as a ∼ a ′ . In this case [a] = [a ′ ].
