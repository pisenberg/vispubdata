				<p>—Continuous Parallel Coordinates (CPC) are a contemporary visualization technique in order to combine several scalar fields, given over a common domain. They facilitate a continuous view for parallel coordinates by considering a smooth scalar field instead of a finite number of straight lines. We show that there are feature curves in CPC which appear to be the dominant structures of a CPC. We present methods to extract and classify them and demonstrate their usefulness to enhance the visualization of CPCs. In particular, we show that these feature curves are related to discontinuities in Continuous Scatterplots (CSP). We show this by exploiting a curve-curve duality between parallel and Cartesian coordinates, which is a generalization of the well-known point-line duality. Furthermore, we illustrate the theoretical considerations. Concluding, we discuss relations and aspects of the CPC&apos;s/CSP&apos;s features concerning the data analysis.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The visual analysis of data has become important within the last years due to the substantial benefit to facilitate an intuitive data access. Especially approaches based on mappings/projections are popular and widely used, e.g., parallel coordinates, scatterplots or radvis, which all visualize the data discretely. For some time past, corresponding continuous visualizations are developed which visualize data uninterrupted. Within those visualizations , additional features occur in comparison to the corresponding discrete visualizations. The additional features convey certain properties about the underlying data, are therefore relevant for the visual analysis, and thus need to be understood concerning their causes and meanings. At present, our community knows a few of such continuous visualization approaches but we know not yet much about the features of them. Two popular examples of continuous visualizations are Continuous Scatterplots <ref type="bibr" coords="1,92.10,404.97,10.45,8.07" target="#b2">[3] </ref>and Continuous Parallel Coordinates <ref type="bibr" coords="1,241.98,404.97,13.74,8.07" target="#b13">[14]</ref> . Concerning this, article <ref type="bibr" coords="1,104.97,414.94,14.94,8.07" target="#b17">[18] </ref> presents a classification of features of Continuous Scatterplots, introduces appropriate detection approaches and gives first rudiments what the meaning of them within the data might be. Furthermore, article <ref type="bibr" coords="1,121.50,444.83,14.94,8.07" target="#b13">[14] </ref>shows that Continuous Scatterplots can be straight transformed into Continuous Parallel Coordinates and that they are therefore related to each other. However, not yet investigated are the features within Continuous Parallel Coordinates which occur, e.g., as edges. Therefore, the theoretical part of our paper completely investigates and describes the mathematical causes of such features, and the practical part of our paper exploits the known features and relations of Continuous Scatterplots and Continuous Parallel Coordinates <ref type="bibr" coords="1,184.64,524.59,14.19,8.07" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,201.00,524.59,11.95,8.07" target="#b17"> 18] </ref>in order to directly detect and illustrate the discussed features within the Continuous Parallel Coordinates. In detail, our contributions are: @BULLET a tool/algorithm to generate a linked overlay between the involved visualization domains in order to examine relations between the features (@BULLET applications in order to demonstrate the feature relations of the involved visualization approaches (Section 6), and @BULLET a discussion of the progress concerning the feature-based data analysis with Continuous Scatterplots/Continuous Parallel Coordinates (Section 7). Following, the related work and background, on which our work is based on, are presented. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK &amp; BACKGROUND</head><p>In 2008, Bachthaler and Weiskopf <ref type="bibr" coords="1,420.89,361.28,10.45,8.07" target="#b2">[3] </ref> presented the visualization approach of Continuous Scatterplots. They extended the concept of discrete scatterplots in order to produce scatterplots which are continuously defined: if the underlying scalar fields are continuous, then the construction of a Continuous Scatterplot (CSP) is possible, as the authors show. Regarding this, a continuous mapping τ : R n → R m between an n-dimensional space and an m-dimensional space is required to define a scalar density function σ (τ) : R m → R, which yields color coded the CSP visualization. The first domain R n of this map τ is known as spatial domain (SD) because the data are measured there. The second domain R m is denoted as data domain (DD). To draw an analogy to physics, a mass is defined by an integral over a volume element weighted with a certain density. Thus, considering a small SD volume element V ∈ R n and the corresponding DD volume element Φ = τ(V ) ∈ R m , the CSP approach assigns each of them a mass value by </p><formula>m sd = ∫ V s(x) d m x (usually s(x) = 1) and m dd = ∫ Φ=τ(V ) σ (ξ ξ ξ = τ(x)) d n ξ ξ ξ . Under </formula><p> the assumption of mass conservation m sd = m dd the required scalar density function σ can be described implicitly as: </p><formula>∫ V s(x) d n x = ∫ Φ=τ(V ) σ (ξ ξ ξ ) d m ξ ξ ξ . </formula><p>Several analytical as well as numerical techniques can be derived from this equation in order to calculate and to render CSPs of most diverse dimensionalities, as shown, e.g., in <ref type="bibr" coords="1,428.30,608.58,9.52,8.07" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="1,444.73,608.58,9.52,8.07" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, or <ref type="bibr" coords="1,472.08,608.58,13.74,8.07" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, the dimensionality of the SD might be an arbitrary value, but the DD is usually two-dimensional as it is typical for a visualization. Later on, in 2009, Heinrich and Weiskopf <ref type="bibr" coords="1,464.09,638.47,14.94,8.07" target="#b13">[14] </ref> presented the visualization approach of Continuous Parallel Coordinates (CPC). They introduced a scheme of continuous density for the concept of parallel coordinates. The approach defines a continuous transformation of the density between the two-dimensional DD and the corresponding two-dimensional parallel coordinates domain (PCD) with aid of the point-line duality <ref type="bibr" coords="1,358.71,698.24,14.19,8.07" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,375.32,698.24,11.21,8.07" target="#b16"> 17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,388.94,698.24,10.64,8.07" target="#b15"> 16]</ref>, which describes that a point in the DD corresponds to a line in the PCD and vice versa. Concerning this, a point η η η = (η 1 , η 2 ) T of the PCD links to a line L in the DD, given by: </p><formula>L : η 2 = n· ξ ξ ξ . </formula><p>Please note that the slope of this line depends on the attribute η 1 : </p><formula>n = (1 − η 1 , η 1 ) T . For the density φ(η 1 , η 2 ) : R 2 → R </formula><formula>∫ Ω φ(η 1 , η 2 ) dη 2 = ∫ Φ σ (ξ ξ ξ ) d 2 ξ ξ ξ . </formula><formula>(1) </formula><p>With the aid of the point-line duality Equation (1) can be rewritten to define the density φ(η η η) of a point η η η = (η 1 , η 2 ) T in the PCD by integration of the density σ (L) over the corresponding line L in the DD: </p><formula>φ(η 1 , η 2 ) = ∫ L σ (L(t)) ||n|| dt. </formula><formula>(2) </formula><p>Based on Equation (2) some approaches to render a CPC from a CSP have been introduced. One approach, named gathering, determines several density values in the PCD by a Monte Carlo integration of the density over the corresponding lines in DD in order to generate a numerical approximation of the CPC which corresponds to a certain DD. Another approach to get such an approximation is called scattering. It takes the backward direction and blends different lines of constant density from samples of the DD onto their corresponding lines in PCD by exploiting the point-line duality. Additionally, a third analytical approach for triangulated data is mentioned, which allows an analytical density interpolation from a triangulated grid of the DD, which is mapped onto the corresponding lines of the PCD. In practice, this rendering approach is very usable due to the fact that a CSP is mostly presented as triangulated data. In 2010, Lehmann and Theisel <ref type="bibr" coords="2,151.50,354.34,14.94,8.07" target="#b17">[18] </ref>started the discussion about discontinuity features within CSPs, in order to enhance the user's ability to even better interpret data with the aid of the CSPs. Regarding this, the discontinuities are non-smooth transitions within the scalar field of density, as which a CSP can be interpreted. The authors introduced mathematical models and detection approaches for discontinuities of several cases of CSPs: a CSP 2D is based on a map from a two-dimensional SD onto a two-dimensional DD; a CSP 3D is based on a map from a three-dimensional SD onto a two-dimensional DD. It has been shown that discontinuities are either caused by effects of the boundary or the mapping function, which connect both involved domains with each other. For a CSP 2D an equivalent parametric surface S ξ ,d can be assigned by </p><formula>S ξ ,d =   ξ 1 = τ 1 (x) ξ 2 = τ 2 (x) d = det(D(τ)(x))   where det(D(τ)(x)</formula><p> ) (with the Jacobian D) codes the reciprocal density value σ (ξ ξ ξ (x)) for a DD element ξ ξ ξ (x) = τ τ τ(x) : R 2 → R 2 . Closed discontinuity curves with infinite density are zero crossings of the surface and the DD described by S ξ ,d=0 . In practice, the SD is bounded. Therefore, further discontinuity curves occur where the boundary edges of the SD are mapped onto the DD. These curves appear as " jumps " within the density. For a CSP 3D the discontinuities can be described via a helpful vector field q(x) = ∇ξ 1 (x) × ∇ξ 2 (x). Curves for which this vector field vanishes q(x) = 0, mapped onto the DD, are discontinuities. If they fulfill that the eigenvalues λ 1 , λ 2 of the Jacobian are ℜ{λ 1 } ≤ 0 ≤ ℜ{λ 2 }, then they form discontinuity curves with infinite density which are denoted as saddle discontinuities . Otherwise they are " jumps " within the density denoted as center discontinuities. Furthermore, interesting boundary effects have been mentioned, which also yield density " jumps " : the boundary edges of the SD, and the boundary switch curves <ref type="bibr" coords="2,169.70,686.56,14.94,8.07" target="#b27">[28] </ref>of the vector field q(x). We consider that the SD, the DD and the PCD are normalized within a range of <ref type="bibr" coords="2,60.43,706.39,9.46,7.96">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,70.88,706.49,6.97,8.07" target="#b0"> 1] </ref>h , whereas h is the dimensionality of a certain domain. <ref type="figure" coords="2,22.50,716.45,30.13,8.07">Figure 1</ref>summarizes the classification of discontinuity features.

Variables related to the spatial domain appear with Latin letters, those which address the data domain or parallel coordinates domain appear with Greek letters. Additionally, lowercase thin variables relate to scalar values and the bold variables relate to vectors with two/three attributes. Uppercase bold variables are lines or curves. Those variables might occur in italic, non-italic or with additional indices for reasons of case differentiation. As mentioned in the related work, we consider three different domains (see <ref type="figure" coords="2,325.01,545.42,28.67,8.07">Figure 2</ref>). Regarding this, a CSP is defined by its density σ over the data domain (DD), and a CPC by its density φ over the parallel coordinates domain (PCD). A CSP based on a 2D/3D spatial domain is a CSP 2D/3D . Certain feature curves within a CSP/CPC appear either as discontinuity curves of density " jumps " , which we denote as edges curves, or they appear as discontinuity curves of an infinite density which we denote as attract curves. Furthermore, feature curves might appear as extreme curves, e.g., ridge curves.  In order to understand the relations between the features of the different domains, several geometric properties are introduced at first. By now, the point-line duality is already known (Section 2). In this section we introduce the curve-curve duality and the circle-area duality which are based on the ellipse-hyperbola duality known, e.g., from <ref type="bibr" coords="3,249.11,106.38,13.74,8.07" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. </p></div>

Proof: let us consider a plain curve ξ ξ ξ (t) : R → R 2 ;t ∈ R in the DD with the tangent vector dξ ξ ξ (t)/dt = ξ ξ ξ ˙ (t), which define a tangent line L L L(t). Due to the point-line duality the line L L L(t) maps to a point curve η η η(t) in the PCD. Consequently, curve ξ ξ ξ (t) and curve η η η(t) link to each other.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Circle-Area Duality</head><p> By the curve-curve duality the point-line duality is extensible to a concept of circle-area duality, as shown in <ref type="figure" coords="3,438.06,277.66,29.54,8.07" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>. It describes that an area of a circle in one domain is linked to an area bounded by the corresponding curve of the other domain. The proof is trivial, thus we mention only the basic scheme of it: two circles with different radii but same center point in one domain are related to two curves in the other domain which are free of intersections (curve-curve duality). Additionally, a circle with radius r = 0 links to a corresponding line of the center point (point-line duality). By converging an arbitrary radius r → 0 the circle-area duality follows directly. We briefly treat the case from the PCD to the DD. Let </p><formula>P r c (t) = (r· cos(t) + c 1 , r· sin(t) + c 2 ) T ;t ∈ </formula><p>{0, 2π} be a circle within the PCD with the center c = (c 1 , c 2 ) T and the radius r. Then, concerning Equation (6), the curve ξ ξ ξ r c (t) in the DD, which envelopes the corresponding area, is given by: </p><formula>ξ ξ ξ r c (t) =   c 2 ·sin(t)+c 1 ·cos(t)+r sin(t) c 2 ·sin(t)−cos(t)+c 1 ·cos(t)+r sin(t)   . </formula><formula>(7) </formula><p>Now we treat the case from the DD onto the PCD. We consider a circle ξ ξ ξ r c (t) = (r· cos(t)+ c 1 , r· sin(t)+ c 2 ) T in the DD. With Equation (4) its corresponding curve in the PCD is: </p><formula>P r c (t) =   sin(t) sin(t)+cos(t) c 1 ·cos(t)+c 2 ·sin(t)+r sin(t)+cos(t)   . </formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Circle-Area linked overlay Algorithm</head><p> What remains is to state an algorithm to link/highlight associated areas . We introduce it for the case from the PCD to the DD, the other case works analogous. The user interactively places a circle P r c with center c and radius r in the PCD. The linked area can be obtained as follows: the corresponding curve ξ ξ ξ r c (t) (c.f. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,183.50,53.34,44.86,8.07">Equation (7)</ref> ) is approximately drawn as polyline L, where one line segment L i is given by the points </p><formula>(ξ ξ ξ r c (t i ), ξ ξ ξ r c (t i+1 </formula><p>)) with t i+1 = t i +h (h steers the resolution). The clipping between polyline L and the domain boundary edges, given by the CohenSutherland or the LiangBarsky technique, yields a polygon which represents the area in DD. We know that the line L c of the center point c is inside of this area. Thus, the polygon can be filled by rasterizations <ref type="bibr" coords="4,72.69,123.08,13.74,8.07" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, as the edge-fill-algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="4,185.64,123.08,10.45,8.07" target="#b0">[1] </ref>or brute-force with a flood-fill seeded at L c . This linking of the areas is shown exemplarily in the applications (Section 6). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">FEATURES</head><p> A CPC equates to a two-dimensional scalar field, caused by the transformation of the DD onto the PCD. Thus, known scalar field features might occur, cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,83.72,193.95,9.71,8.07" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,96.06,193.95,6.72,8.07" target="#b8"> 9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,105.41,193.95,10.64,8.07" target="#b20"> 21]</ref> . Additionally, the investigation of the feature's relations is important to facilitate the visual analysis of data by CPCs. In this section we investigate the boundary features, the local features as well as the global features. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Boundary Features</head><p>Figure 6 illustrates the relations of the boundary: the boundary edges of the DD map to the corner points of the PCD. The boundary corner points left-down/right-up of the DD map to the upper/downer boundary edges of the PCD. Thus, these domain structures are not able to mutually influence the quality of the corresponding visualization because they are just barely visible by the user. In contrast, the rightdown/left-up corner points map to diagonal lines which lie across the visualization. The intersection point of these diagonal lines generates a corresponding diagonal line within the DD. Consequently, the transformation from DD to PCD causes that certain areas of one domain visually affect certain areas of the other domain stronger than other areas. Concerning this, the distribution of gray-scale values of <ref type="figure" coords="4,96.86,373.61,30.35,8.07" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref>visually links the areas of DD and PCD which mutual affects strongest; marked by similar gray-scale values. Thus, for instance noise within the DD near the right-down/left-up corner points would be mapped more in the center of the PCD, in contrast to noise close to the other corner points. In other words: the closer the density values of a CSP to the right-down/left-up corner points are, the more they influence the visual quality of the CPC. Furthermore, a CPC is not invariant of rotations of the corresponding CSP. Similar effects are already known from the discrete parallel coordinates. data domain parallel coordinates domain </p></div>

Such local features are especially important for the numerous visualization and analysis approaches which are based on the Morse-Smale Com- plex <ref type="bibr" coords="4,302.48,83.27,14.19,8.07" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,318.75,83.27,10.64,8.07" target="#b11"> 12]</ref>. Several local feature detection approaches such as <ref type="bibr" coords="4,516.19,83.27,9.71,8.07" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,527.97,83.27,7.47,8.07" target="#b6"> 7] </ref>are already known. Thus, we do not treat this aspect. Two cases are possible: features with a finite scalar value and features with an infinite scalar value. The last case are isolated singularities of the scalar field. Based on the point-line duality the question arises whether those local features form characteristic lines in CPC. The case of local features with a finite scalar value does not, as we will briefly explain: the feature's curvation, given by κ, describes the behavior of the environed scalar values. If κ is small, the feature's scalar value is similar to the scalar values of its ε-environment and causes lines with similar density in the CPC, which strongly visually influence each other. The more κ grows, the more distinct is the corresponding line of a feature within the CPC, in comparison to lines of the ε-environment. But this is not a stable property in order to characterize local feature lines in general. Thus, this kind of local features might produce visible lines, but this is neither a stable property nor a characteristic structure. Unlike, the case of local singularity features of a scalar field. They would cause characteristic CPC lines with an infinite density. Thus, we further need to consider the special case of such singularities caused by CSP 2D/3D . The attract curves of a CSP 2D are curves of the parametric surface with S ξ ,d=0 (cf. Section 2). The attract curves of a CSP 3D are the feature lines of the vector field q. Both structures depend on the scalar functions ξ 1 = τ 1 (x) and ξ 2 = τ 2 (x). By varying one of these functions, both structures might shrink to a single point during their evolution (<ref type="figure" coords="4,343.00,340.40,27.98,8.07" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref>). Then, the CSP's attracted curves form local isolated singularities. By a small variation or by adding noise these singularities would break and are not stable within the attracted curve life cycle. Thus, isolated singularities in σ are not relevant concerning CSP 2D/3D . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Global Features</head><p>In this section, we investigate the relations of global features between the DD and the CPC. Such global features are mainly discontinuity curves which either form edge curves or attract curves. At first, we treat the case of a generic scalar field σ (ξ ξ ξ ), given over the DD. Afterwards , we explore the behavior between the CSP 2D/3D and the CPC as special cases of scalar fields. </p></div>

Within an infinitesimal region, the curve's behavior can be described by the </p><p>(semi) osculating circle P r c (t) with radius r(t) and center c(t): </p><formula>r(t) = (ξ 1 ˙ (t) 2 + ξ 2 ˙ (t) 2 ) 3 2 det(ξ ξ ξ ˙ (t), ξ ξ ξ ¨ (t)) , c(t) =    ξ 1 (t) − ξ 2 ˙ (t)·(ξ 1 ˙ (t) 2 +ξ 2 ˙ (t) 2 ) det(ξ ξ ξ ˙ (t),ξ ξ ξ ¨ (t)) ξ 2 (t) − ξ 1 ˙ (t)·(ξ 1 ˙ (t) 2 +ξ 2 ˙ (t) 2 ) det(ξ ξ ξ ˙ (t),ξ ξ ξ ¨ (t))    . </formula><p>In order to simplify the considerations below, we place the ordinate's origin in c(t) and we consider the circle's system as aligned with the ξ ξ ξ axes. Let us assume that the discontinuity curve ξ ξ ξ (t) is an edge curve. Then, the edge curve can be locally described as a disk of a high σ (ξ ξ ξ ) = a ∈ R over the osculating circle P r c (t) (σ (ξ ξ ξ ) = 0 else). </p><formula>µ = √ r(t) 2 − ξ 2 1 </formula><p>, is given by (cf. Equation </p><p>(2)): </p><formula>φ(L ξ (t)) = |2· ∫ µ 0 a dµ| = |2· a· √ (r(t) 2 ) − ξ 2 |. </formula><p>This is a monotonically decreasing density function (<ref type="figure" coords="5,235.91,427.82,29.80,8.07" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref>(b)) for ξ ∈ {0, ∞}. Therefore, an edge curve in DD is not mapped onto an edge curve in PCD, i.e., the edge disappears. We denote this as smoothness effect, which informally means: an edge in DD is smoothed by the CPC's transformation. Let us now assume that the discontinuity curve ξ ξ ξ (t) is an attract curve. Then, the behavior of this curve can be locally described by its osculating circle P r c (t). The scalar value σ (ξ ) at distance ξ along the ξ 1 axis can be described as σ (ξ ) = 1/|r(t) − ξ | a , so that the scalar value is infinite at the periphery of the osculating circle. We assume this kind of functional behavior for each center line of P r c (t), which is orthogonal to the periphery (<ref type="figure" coords="5,145.92,537.65,29.81,8.07" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref>(c)). For each distance µ on a (vertical) line L ξ (t), the scalar value σ µ (ξ ) is given by the shortest distance between the corresponding line point L ξ ,µ (t) and the periph- ery: </p><formula>σ µ (ξ ) = |(||L ξ ,µ (t)|| − r(t))| −a . </formula><p>Thus, the density φ(L ξ (t)) in PCD for a line L ξ (t) in DD is given by: </p><formula>φ(L ξ (t)) = ∫ µ | √ (µ 2 + ξ 2 ) − r(t)| −a dµ. </formula><formula>(8) </formula><p>This integral cannot be solved analytically. Nevertheless, the density behavior strongly depends on the exponent a. If a ≥ 1 for ξ ∈ {0, r(t)}, the density φ is infinite for each line L ξ (t): the attract curve in DD maps onto a region in PCD with infinite density. If a ≥ 1 for ξ = r(t) and 0 ≤ a &lt; 1 else, then, each tangent line gives an infinite density, the other lines do not. Due to the curve-curve duality, such a curve maps onto a curve in PCD with infinite density. If a ≥ 1 for ξ ∈ R, then, there is no line with infinite density in PCD. Thus, such a curve maps on a smooth density plateau in the PCD. Subsequently, we investigate solutions of </p><formula>f (s, a) = ∫ s(x)=a 1 ∥∇s∥ dx. </formula><formula>(9) </formula><p>For a 2D field s, f is obtained by integrating 1 ∥∇s∥ over one (or more) isocurves in arc length parametrization. <ref type="figure" coords="5,444.26,396.31,30.97,8.07">Figure 9</ref>(a) illustrates this. There is an alternative way to compute f : integrate the co-gradient field of s from a point x 0 on the contour s(x) = a, f (s, a) is the time until it returns to x 0 again (or it leaves the domain in both forward and backward direction). <ref type="figure" coords="5,370.98,436.16,30.14,8.07">Figure 9</ref>(b) illustrates this. For a 3D scalar field s, f is obtained by integrating 1 ∥∇s∥ over an isosurface in a local area-preserving parametrization. <ref type="figure" coords="5,490.59,459.69,30.58,8.07">Figure 9</ref> (c) illustrates this. The contour in integral gives a well-defined value as long as ∇s does not vanish. However, in order to analyze feature curves in CPC, we are especially interested in the behavior of f at critical points of s. We analyze this by considering a second order approximation of s having a critical point at 0 and a Hessian whose eigenvectors λ λ λ i are aligned with the coordinate axes: </p><formula>s(x) = λ λ λ 1 2 x 2 + λ λ λ 2 2 y 2 ( + λ λ λ 3 2 z 2 ) </formula><p>where f (s, 0) is the particular point of interest. Fortunately, for this Equation (9) has a closed form solution 1 which gives the following cases: 2D: if s(0) is a local maximum </p><formula>(i.e., λ 1 , λ 2 &gt; 0), f (s, a</formula><p>) has a discontinuity at 0. <ref type="figure" coords="5,364.50,611.10,35.25,8.07" target="#fig_8">Figure 10</ref>(a) illustrates this. A similar statement holds for a local minimum.

If s(0) forms a local saddle, </p><formula>(i.e., λ 1 , λ 2 , λ 3 &lt; 0), then f (</formula><p>s, a) has a local finite maximum at a = 0. <ref type="figure" coords="5,294.10,690.87,34.61,8.07" target="#fig_8">Figure 10</ref>(d) illustrates this. Note that the asymptotic behavior of f around critical points in s is different in 2D and 3D. Now we establish the relation of feature lines in CSP and CPC by: </p><formula>(a) 0 0 0 0 (b) (c) (d) </formula><formula>lemma 1 The density φ(η η η) at a point η η η = (η 1 , η 2 ) T in the PCD is f (s, a) with s(x) = det ( ξ 1 (x) −η 1 ξ 2 (x) 1 − η 1 ) , a = η 2 . </formula><p>Proof: Due to the point-line duality, the point (η 1 , η 2 ) in the PCD corresponds to the line det </p><formula>( ξ 1 (x) −η 1 ξ 2 (x) 1 − η 1 ) </formula><p>= η 2 in implicit form in the DD (<ref type="figure" coords="6,56.15,436.51,34.58,8.07" target="#fig_10">Figure 11</ref>(a)). Its integration in SD gives the lemma (<ref type="figure" coords="6,258.50,436.51,10.76,8.07">Fig</ref></p><formula>r = (−η 1 , 1 − η 1 ) T of a line L in DD yields, with the Jacobian D = D(τ τ τ(x)</formula><p>), a tangent vector v of the corresponding curve in SD: </p><formula>v = ( τ 1 x τ 1 y τ 2 x τ 2 y ) −1 · r = ( τ 2 y −τ 1 y −τ 2 x τ 1 x ) · det(D). </formula><p>The co-gradient ∇ −1 s(x) for a certain threshold η 2 , concerning the contour integral, is then defined through: </p><formula>∇ −1 s(x) = ∇ −1 det ( ξ 1 (x) −η 1 ξ 2 (x) 1 − η 1 ) = v· det(D). </formula><p>The density in DD <ref type="bibr" coords="6,95.42,614.41,10.45,8.07" target="#b2">[3] </ref>is given by: σ = det(D) −1 . Two properties directly follow: (i) the vector length ||∇ −1 s(x)|| corresponds to the DD's density, and (ii) an integration curve of ∇ −1 s(x) equates to a certain curve in the SD, whose integration time t φ gives the PCD's density φ(L) = φ(η η η) for a certain line L of the DD (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,222.76,656.64,43.83,8.07">Equation (2)</ref>). This way, all domains are related to each other. As suggested in the contour integral's discussion, we have to treat the critical points. Due to (i), critical points in ∇ −1 s(x) = 0 are also discontinuity points in DD: σ (ξ ξ ξ ) = ∞. There, two behaviors are possible (<ref type="figure" coords="6,38.96,706.45,33.31,8.07" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref>(a)): a center or a saddle behavior. For a center behavior, the integration time t φ , and thus the density φ(η η η) in PCD, in the center's environment is constant (in a first order approximation), and gets abruptly to 0 at the critical point. Hence, for the center case, the DD's discontinuity point ξ ξ ξ with σ (ξ ξ ξ ) = ∞ corresponds to a point η η η in PCD which is a " jump " within the density φ. For a saddle behavior, the integration time t φ is infinite at the saddle's streamline: t φ = ∞. Hence, for the saddle case, the DD's discontinuity point ξ ξ ξ with σ (ξ ξ ξ ) = ∞ corresponds to a point η η η in PCD with an infinite density: φ(η η η) = ∞. </p></div>

The critical points form closed curves in s(x, η 1 ), so-called feature lines <ref type="bibr" coords="6,372.67,315.92,13.74,8.07" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, which <ref type="figure" coords="6,421.09,315.92,36.77,8.07" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref>(b) illustrates. Let </p><formula>s(t) = (x(t), y(t), η 1 (t)</formula><p>) T be a feature line of s(x, η 1 ): due to (i) it links to a DD attract curve </p><formula>ξ ξ ξ (t) = (ξ 1 = τ 1 (x(t), y(t)), ξ 2 = τ 2 (x(t), y(t))) T . </formula><p>In addition, the feature line s(t) links to a curve in the PCD </p><formula>η η η(t) = (η 1 (t), s(x(t), y(t), η 1 (t))) T . </formula><p>If feature line s(t) has a center behavior, then η η η(t) is an edge curve. If s(t) has a saddle behavior, then η η η(t) is an attract curve: φ(η η η(t)) = ∞. Finally, due to transitivity, a CSP 2D discontinuity curve ξ ξ ξ (t) links to a discontinuity curve η η η(t) in the corresponding CPC, which is summarized in <ref type="figure" coords="6,314.47,449.86,34.61,8.07" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref>(c). Case of CSP 3D Based on the counter integral, we discuss the CSP 3D case in more detail now. Unlike the previous case, the SD is three-dimensional. Thus, a DD line L maps onto a surface within vector field q = ∇ξ 1 × ∇ξ 2 <ref type="bibr" coords="6,387.49,496.59,13.74,8.07" target="#b17">[18]</ref> , given over the SD. The discontinuities of a CSP 3D correspond to feature lines in q. Hence, the density </p><formula>φ(η η η) = φ(L L L) </formula><p> in the PCD is given by the integration over the corresponding surface area in q. All domains are now related to each other. It is not a trivial task to calculate this area, but the behavior of the surface area strongly depends on the area's evolution in the environment of the critical point in q. Therefore, using the contour integral for a 3D scalar field s gives this evolution behavior. The 3D scalar field s of the contour integral f (s, η 1 ), concerning a certain DD's tangent vector </p><formula>r = (−η 1 , 1 − η 1 ) T , is given by s(x) = det ( ξ 1 (x, y, z) r x ξ 2 (x, y, z) r y ) . </formula><p>Each line L in the DD with constant r belongs to an iso-surface in s(x). The vector field ∇s(x) codes the area's contributions for the line L. In contrast to q, the critical points in ∇s(x) are isolated points, with the property that a critical point in ∇s(x) lies on a feature line in q, but not vice versa: ∇s(x) = 0 → q = 0. Note: Would one collect and join the critical points of ∇s(x) for the whole range of r, one would reveal the feature lines of q. This way, vector field s(x) and q are related to each other, i.e., the one is a kind of decomposition of the other. However, a line L which touches a DD's discontinuity point corresponds to a critical point in ∇s(x). Thus, we need to investigate the behavior of the integral contour at the critical points. Two kinds of critical points in ∇s(x) are possible: a center or a saddle critical point. Please note that a center in ∇s(x) appears if the corresponding point on a feature line in q is also a center discontinuity. The same applies for a saddle. A center critical point corresponds to the introduced 3D maximum behavior of the contour integral f (s, η 1 ): the density φ is linearly growing with the (Euclidean) distance to the critical point and is 0 at the critical point. Therefore, the density map from a center critical point onto the PCD does not reveal a discontinuity. Besides, an alternative explanation for this is given by the smoothness effect: since a center discontinuity yields an edge curve within the DD <ref type="bibr" coords="7,231.75,308.72,13.74,8.07" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, it cannot be a discontinuity within the PCD. A saddle critical point corresponds to the introduced 3D's minimum behavior of the contour integral f (s, η 1 ): The density φ has a local maximum at the critical point which decreases with the (Euclidean) distance to the critical point. Therefore, the density map from a saddle critical point onto the CPC does not reveal a discontinuity, but a local maximum curve, a so-called ridge curve (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,198.13,378.47,13.44,8.07" target="#b20">[21]</ref> ). This is an unexpected result because it means that discontinuity features completely disappear within a corresponding CPC. Finally, one special case needs to be discussed. If a CSP 3D based on the SDs of a CSP 2D would be created just by stacking the twodimensional SDs one above the other, then the critical points in ∇s would become features lines. However, such feature lines would be structurally instable and disappear by adding noise. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.3">Numerical Considerations about the CPC Rendering</head><p>During the CPC rendering, the numerical quantification error might cause a poor sampling of lathy smooth regions within the PCD's density . The more lathy the regions are, the stronger this effect might be. In our discussion, this effect mainly concerns the edge curves in DD, which correspond to a " quickly fallen " density function in PCD. A poor quantification depends on the sampling's resolution and yields pseudo edges within the CPC which we denote as shadow edges. From our experience, shadow edges are mainly weak artifacts which are getting weaker by increasing resolution. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.4">CPC Feature Curves Detection Algorithm</head><p>The CSP attract curves form also feature curves in the CPC and thus need to be detected. In <ref type="bibr" coords="7,116.99,599.72,13.74,8.07" target="#b17">[18]</ref> , algorithmic approaches have been introduced in order to detect the CSP's feature curves. By applying these approaches, a feature curve is approximately given by a polyline L. Through the curve-curve duality we know that curves of the involved domains are related. Therefore, we have to map the polyline L in DD onto the corresponding polyline in PCD, which approximates the corresponding curve in CPC. A single line segment L i ; i = 1, . . . , k, with a startpoint/endpoint </p><formula>L i s = (ξ 1 is , ξ 2 is ) T and L i e = (ξ 1 ie , ξ 2 ie ) T can </formula><p>be interpreted as the first order approximation of the tangent vector on the DD's feature curve at a certain point.

First, the local features do not generate stable features. Furthermore , global features as attract curves of a CSP 2D/3D form features stable within the CPC.

Furthermore, edge curves in general disappear due to the smoothness effect, but – depending on the resolution – they might produce weak shadow edges. <ref type="figure" coords="7,498.31,311.15,26.23,8.07" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>summarizes the classification and their relations concerning the features. </p></div>

The second example yields the CSP 3D based on a SD range of </p><formula>[−2, 3] × [−2, 3] × [−2, 3] </formula><p>and a resolution of 1400 × 1400, where the underlying scalar fields of the DD are given by: </p><formula>CSP 3D 2 := ( ξ 1 (x) = sin(z)· sin(x)· x + sin(y)· y + sin(z)· z ξ 2 (x) = sin(z)· sin(x)· y + sin(y)· x + sin(z)· y ) . </formula><p>In comparison to the CPC of the 2D case, the CPC of the 3D case looks generally more blurred (cf. Section 5.3). It can be seen that only the CSP's attract curves (saddle discontinuities) link to smooth maximum density curves within the CPC, or form shadow edges in certain circumstances. All further features, as boundary curves or center discontinuities, disappear. Also the number of CSP features does not correlate to the number of the few CPC features (compare <ref type="figure" coords="9,266.92,403.21,14.95,8.07;9,31.50,413.17,22.50,8.07" target="#fig_3">Fig- ure 15</ref>(a) with </p><p>(b)). Altogether, it confirms that only the attract curves of CSP 2D/3D have a counterpart within the CPCs. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">DATA ANALYSIS BY CSP/CPC: A FEW CONSIDERATIONS</head><p>In this section we discuss the progress concerning the data analysis with CSPs/CPCs. Article <ref type="bibr" coords="9,68.13,475.22,14.94,8.07" target="#b17">[18] </ref>has shown that the number of inverse image elements of map function τ changes at discontinuity curves of a CSP 2D/3D . Since the features of CSP map onto features in the CPC, the same statement also applies for them (inverse image property). Since the CSPs/CPCs are appropriate as visualization method for a variety of data sets, e.g., physical, statistical, or other, it is not trivial to figure out what this abstract semantic property means for a certain case. Nevertheless, these structures are in the data, thus relevant for the analysis, and detectable by those features. Furthermore, the SD boundary edges always yield edge curves in the CSP 2D/3D as visual result of the SD's finiteness. Thus, the CSP edge curves are not relevant for the data analysis because they have nothing to do with the data. On the contrary, the attract curves are really caused by the data. The mapping function τ between SD and DD is always based on the underlying data and consequently the (databased ) attract curves represent characteristics of the data. <ref type="figure" coords="9,246.49,626.97,35.39,8.07" target="#fig_4">Figure 16</ref>illustrates the CSP 2D 1 (<ref type="bibr" coords="9,115.61,638.08,48.89,8.07">Equation (10)</ref>) and CSP 3D 1 , which consists of the following two DD scalar fields </p><formula>CSP 3D 1 := ( ξ 1 (x) = sin(x)· x + sin(y)· y + sin(z)· z ξ 2 (x) = sin(x)· y + sin(y)· x + sin(z)· y ) . </formula><p> It can be seen that the attract curves are characteristic for the underlying scalar fields, while the boundary caused edge curves are volatile and unspecific. There is one special case concerning the CSP 3D which needs to be further discussed: the center discontinuities (cf. <ref type="figure" coords="9,224.95,736.38,29.85,8.07">Figure 1</ref>).

Are they also relevant for the analysis? Not necessarily, as we will explain as follows: A center discontinuity is a by-product of two saddle discontinuities [18] due to the mathematical properties of the underlying vector field q. Shannon [23] points out that information is the measure of unpredictability. If there are two saddle discontinuities, it is predictable that there is one center discontinuity belonging to them, i.e., no further information about the data is available. Furthermore, the pathway of the saddle discontinuities specifies the pathway of the corresponding center discontinuity, i.e., also no further information about the data is available . In summary, neither the existents nor the pathway of the center discontinuities contain more or new information as the corresponding saddle discontinuities already convey. Finally, it follows for CSP 2D/3D that the attract curves are relevant for the data analysis. Fortunately, those attract curve features, which are relevant for the data analysis, remain in a CPC (cf. Figure 2), while non-relevant edge curve features disappear due to the smoothness effect: a CPC conveys only relevant features (relevance property), a CSP conveys relevant as well as nonrelevant features. This shows an advantage of the CPCs in comparison to the CSPs and concerning the data analysis. 8 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we investigated the features of CPCs, their classification, and their relations to known CSP features. With the linked overlay tool we proposed a method to check our theses by other scientists, and gave an algorithmic detection approach for the CPC features based on the curve-curve duality. Additionally, we described the smoothness effect which blurred CSP edges, and shadow edges caused by numerical reasons . Concluding, we introduced the inverse image property and the relevance property of CPCs, which are new contributions concerning the task of a CPC/CSP-based data analysis. The statement of the paper is that only CSP&apos;s attract curves – which are the relevant features concerning the data analysis – map stable and form the dominant CPC features, while other features disappear. Thus, especially for unexperienced users the CPC is less confusing. What remains for the future is to develop feature-based reconstruction approaches for CPC/CSP and appropriate Linking &amp; Brushing [6] tools for CPCs, in order to investigate further properties between features and underlying data to further improve the task of data analysis. Additionally, the analysis of the features for CPCs/CSPs concerning time-dependent multivariate data will be done.
