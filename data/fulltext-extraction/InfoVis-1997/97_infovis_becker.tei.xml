			<abstract>
				<p>A method for efficiently volume rendering dense scatterplots of relational data is described. Plotting difficulties that arise from large numbers of data points, categorical variables, interaction with non-axis dimensions, and unknown values, are addressed by this method. The domain of the plot is voxelized using binning and then volume rendered. Since a table is used as the underlying data structure, no storage is wasted on regions with no data. The opacity of each voxel is a function of the number of data points in a corresponding bin. A voxel&apos;s color is derived by averaging the value of one of the variables for all the data points that fall in a bin. Other variables in the data may be mapped to external query sliders. A dragger object permits a user to select regions inside the volume.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Scatterplots have proven to be an excellent means for representing multivariate data. Each data point is drawn as a geometric object. Its size, shape, color, and position are determined by numeric variables of the data. The ability to produce one, two, or three dimensional scatterplots is a common feature of many visualization systems. Conventional scatterplots lose their effectiveness, however, as the number of points becomes large.</p><p>Modern relational databases often contain so many rows (data points) that it is impractical to attempt to display all of them interactively. Even if the display of so many points were possible, its usefulness would be diminished by excessive occlusion. Random sampling is sometimes used to reduce the size of a large datasets. Another alternative is aggregation based on a categorical variables in the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Each aggregate becomes an object in the scatterplot.</p><p>Several techniques besides scatterplots have been used to represent multivariate data. Allen and Ward <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> devel-oped a system that allows a user to link alternative views using brushing. The alternative multivariate visualizations they used were: pairwise scatterplots, star glyphs, parallel coordinates, and dimensional stacking. Each of these systems prefers numeric variables.</p><p>Space projection and data compression using wavelets were used effectively by Wong et. al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> to increase interaction in their version of HyperSlice <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> (a tool for showing two dimensional scatterplots for all pairs of numerical dimensions). The wavelets provide a means for multi-resolution compression and automatic error measurement.</p><p>In relational databases it is common for many of the variables (columns) to be categorical rather than numerical. The values of such variables have no explicit ordering. This property makes them difficult to map to a linear scatterplot axis. Ahlberg and Wistrand <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> have created a highly interactive visualization system which allows categorical variables to appear as interactive query devices (like sliders, alpha-sliders, and toggles).</p><p>Presented here is a data structure and rendering method which addresses problems presented by too many data points, occlusion, categorical variables, and unknown values. In addition the described method allows for animation of the plot along several additional dimensions, shown as external query sliders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Data Representation</head><p>Uniform binning is used to discretize the real variables mapped to spatial axes or independent slider dimensions. Unique values define the bins for categorical axes. The trade-off between accuracy and rendering speed is determined by binning resolution. A table is a natural data structure for representing the visualization because of the sparsity of the multi-dimensional space. Suppose that be-fore processing we have a table containing 149,643 rows. Selected rows and columns are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>The columns education, occupation, and hours_worked (per week) will be mapped to the x, y, and z axes in the plot. Age will be shown as an external query slider. This will allow showing changes in distribution as age is varied. Thus the first step is to bin the variables age and hours_worked to a desired resolution. The dependent variable, income in this example, is left unbinned, as it will be mapped to color. Lastly an aggregation is performed to compute counts and averages for income using the categorical and binned numeric variables as keys. This results in the processed data shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. There will be at most one row (bin) for each combination of the axes and query variables.</p><p>After processing, there are up to three columns for variables mapped to axes. There is also a column for the number (or more generally, the weight) of data points in each bin. In some cases, it may be desirable to weight records by the value of some other variable, rather than simply counting once for each record. For example there might be a row for every town in a geographic region and a column for population. In this case we should weight each record by population. The sum of record weights in a bin is used to determine opacity. There is one numeric column which represents the weighted average value of the aggregated data in each bin. This column is used to determine color.  Finally there may be columns corresponding to other variables which are to be used for slider dimensions. The binning and aggregating is performed as part of preprocessing. In MineSet <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, where this tool has been implemented, this preprocessing can be performed on the server where the database resides. Only the processed table need be returned to the client for visualization. There are only 4,871 rows and 6 columns in the processed table compared to 149,643 rows and 200 columns in the original table.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Categorical Axes</head><p>If a categorical variable is mapped onto an axis, then the binning is defined to be the distinct values of that variable, or some grouping of these values based on additional intelligence, or a user specified grouping.</p><p>The order of bins along a categorical axis can be determined by sorting the distinct values in a number of possible ways. The categorical values may be sorted alphabetically, numerically by weight, or numerically by aggregate value of some other variable. It was found that sorting by average value of the variable mapped to color provided the most benefit. By looking at how dramatically the color changes along a categorical axis, it is possible to see how well that categorical variable correlates with the variable mapped to color. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows occupations sorted by average income along the left axis, and education on the right. The occupation, executive-managerial, listed at the end of the axis has the highest average income, and private-house-services had the lowest. The ordering for the values of education was generally from low to high, but in one or two cases there were anomalies in the order. This unexpected ordering may be caused by too little data, or it may be something that requires more investigation to explain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Volume Rendering</head><p>Once the dataset has been processed it is in a form that volume rendering algorithms of any type can handle. We arrived at this point by binning and aggregation, rather than sampling.</p><p>Since the result is expected to represent an amorphous cloud of colored data points, it is felt that splatting using Gaussian footprints <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> is the most natural choice for volume rendering. Another advantage of splatting is interactivity. The downside is a lack of depth cues, such as shading and shadowing, which more expensive methods could provide. This deficiency can be compensated for through the use of a stereo display. A splat can be drawn as a collection of Gouraud shaded triangles <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, or as texture mapped rectangles <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The bins(voxels), which represent a local cloud of scattered data points, are volume rendered as Gaussian splats. The opacity of each splat is a function of the density of data in the corresponding bin as computed by:</p><p>where is the opacity value of a splat at its center, weight is the total weight of aggregated data points in the corresponding bin, and u is a scale factor. The above exponential opacity function is effective in modeling light propagation through clouds of tiny light-emitting spheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. The color of the splat is determined by the color computed for the corresponding bin. The splats are drawn, in back to front order, at each bin location to form an image that approximates the appearance of a scatterplot of the original data.</p><p>A slider can be used to vary the value of the scale factor u. This allows global scaling of the opacity for each splat to make an entire display image of rendered splats more or less transparent. This process is nonlinear. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1a</ref>, u is small so that only regions of dense data are prominent. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1b</ref>, u is large so that even bins containing only a few data points are visible. Note that there is a higher variability of color in the regions where record counts are low.</p><p>Volume rendering involving ray-tracing or cell-projection can also be used to represent bins of aggregated data points. The bin positions containing no data are assumed to have zero density. At bin positions where data is present, the density is directly proportional to the weight of those scattered data points. For ray-tracing <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, volumes are rendered by using bin centers to form a uniform grid. For cell-projection <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, cubes are constructed by using bin centers as vertices. The transparent cubes can be rendered directly, or using tetrahedral decomposition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Smooth Slider Animation</head><p>It is often useful to animate a visualization over additional independent variables. This can be accomplished by tracing a path on an external slider dimension. Recall that we needed to bin this dimension in order to have a densely populated scatterplot at any of a finite number of positions along the slider. Between discrete positions on a slider we would like to interpolate scatterplots in order to have smooth animation.</p><p>There is a table for each binned position on an external query slider. For interpolation on a one dimensional external slider, two adjacent tables are merged together, then aggregated using the axis columns as unique keys. The weight is simply interpolated (0 weight is assumed if one of the tables lacks a particular row). The average value used for color is also interpolated, but weighted by the weight. For example, suppose we want to show an image α 1 e u weight ⋅ --= α to represent an interpolated scatterplot t of the way from <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3 to Table 4 on an external slider. Let Tables 3 and 4</ref> be the tables for age=15-25 and age=25-35, respectively.</p><p>For <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> add a new weight column equal to (1-t) weight, and a new weighted value column equal to (1-t) (weight)(value). For <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>, add a new weight column equal to (t)(weight), and a new weighted value column equal to (t)(weight)(value). Merge the two new tables together.</p><p>Using the spatial axes columns as keys, aggregate by summation the two new columns. Finally divide the summed value by the summed weight to get the interpolated values for income. If t=.5, the resulting table would be <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>.</p><p>If the external query slider has two dimensions, as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, then bilinear interpolation is used. The red regions represent places where the data is dense, while white shows areas that are sparse. When the slider is positioned over a black point the image shows uninterpolated data. One may trace out a path on the slider and animate over it using the VCR control panel below the slider <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. A volume rendered scatterplot itself may act as an external slider to a second scatterplot or other visual tool.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Interactive Picking and Filtering</head><p>An opaque dragger is located in the volume and can be moved to select regions of the volume. As the dragger moves over regions containing data, its color changes to   reflect the average value of the data it is passing through. Relevant textual information is displayed in the dialogue at the top. Another purpose an opaque manipulator can serve is selecting a region in preparation for drilling through the visualization to the underlying data. One or more bounding cubes can be dragged open to define a selection in the volume which can be used as a query to send back to the server. This query can extract original data from the database for further exploration via this or some other tool. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3</ref> the original data corresponding to the box selection is displayed in a record viewer.</p><p>A filter panel <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4</ref>) is used to constrain the volume to show specific values or ranges of values along any of the dimensions. This has the effect of slicing the data along desired axes. It can also be used to select only certain ranges of the dependent variable or to show only regions with high or low density.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Handling Unknowns</head><p>It is common for relational data to contain NULL (unknown) values. These NULL values are treated quite differently from 0 or some other value. For example, NULL+v1+v2=NULL while, average(NULL,v1,v2)= (v1+v2)/2.</p><p>For purposes of visualization, the position for a NULL value is placed offset below the origin of the corresponding axis so it is not confused with other values. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> the value of horsepower for some of the cars represented in this dataset is sometimes NULL. These values appear at the bottom of the image offset from the lowest horsepower bin. Gray is used if all the data in a given bin have NULL values for the color variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusions and Future Research</head><p>The speed and accuracy of this technique depends on the binning resolution of the spatial axes variables. The original data never needs to reside on the client computer. A Volume of 20x50x50, where 1/3 of the voxels contain data, is interactive on a minimally configured Silicon Graphics O2.</p><p>Unlike physical datasets for which volume rendering is most commonly applied, increasing the resolution of the volume does not necessarily provide more benefit. Sometimes just a coarse volume with a few bins in each direction will provide more insight than something which is slower to render or has high variance due to few records.</p><p>Among the directions for future research are: finding methods for enhancing depth perception, adding the ability to map a categorical variable to color, showing variance in individual splats, and grouping of categorical variables on an axis.</p><p>Volume rendering of relational datasets is most successful when the amount of data to be viewed is large. Fortunately, the trend of increasingly large databases is likely to continue.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1a .</head><label>1a</label><figDesc>The opacity factor, u, is reduced to show just dense regions.
