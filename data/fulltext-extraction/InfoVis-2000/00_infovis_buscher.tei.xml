			<abstract>
				<p>Drawing on ethnographic studies of (landscape) architects at work, this paper presents a human-centered approach to information visualization. A 3D collaborative electronic workspace allows people to configure, save, and browse arrangements of heterogeneous work materials. Spatial arrangements and links are created and maintained as an integral part of ongoing work with &apos;live&apos; documents and objects. The result is an extension of the physical information space of the architects&apos; studio that utilizes the potential of electronic data storage, visualization, and network technologies to support work with information in context.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Design professions are seldom considered to benefit from information visualization (see, however, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>). While scientists, stock traders, or logistic managers draw upon vast stores of fairly uniform data, architects and others concerned with aesthetic design assemble and assess a heterogeneous array of information. Textual definitions of building standards or plant specifications are considered alongside technical detail drawings; sketches and concept drawings; photographs, or models that explore aesthetic features such as color, shape, texture, or lighting. It is difficult to see how such a diverse range of information could usefully be made amenable to information visualization techniques.</p><p>However, the visualization of automatically recognizable patterns in huge volumes of data -based on statistical analysis or interpretation of file meta-data such as date stamps, author, or size -is only one aspect of the newly emerging discipline of Information Visualization. The World Wide Web has been a spur to the imagination with a view to visualizing information differently. In effect, a 'next generation of graphical user interfaces' has become possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Innovative activity focuses on several core questions: How to increase the volume of information that can be displayed? How to aid orientation? What kinds of visualizations suit which kinds of information? How do these questions relate to issues of human perception? How can we extend the possibilities to manipulate information, and support collaboration? How could information visualization dovetail with the potential of ubiquitous computing and augmented reality?</p><p>These issues are highly relevant for aesthetic design professions. Drawing on ethnographic studies of landscape architects and architects at work within Desarte <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> , we are designing a system that attempts to address these core issues in a way that is directly aimed at supporting architectural work. In the following sections we provide a brief synopsis of ethnographic observations drawing on work on a particular landscape architecture project, selectively discuss developments in information visualization systems in this light, and describe a system we have developed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">CREATIVITY, COMPLEXITY, AND PRECISION</head><p>'The Deep' <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1</ref>) is a new aquatic visitor attraction on the north east coast of England. Its design is being developed and coordinated by a group of architects. The landscape architects are one amongst many professional partners called in to deal with particular aspects of this ambitious project. Also involved are ecologists, engineers, a quantity surveyor who deals with overall cost estimates for materials, and a specialist interior design firm who create museum displays and exhibition designs, which also have an influence on the design of the exterior space.</p><p>This constellation of different perspectives generates a vast amount of information. There are ca. 800 paper documents, and the folder containing the landscape architects' electronic work files alone contains over 500MB in ca. 150 documents. One of the principals explains that 'only about 20% of our time on this project is spent on design. The rest is eaten up by information work -waiting for information from others, providing information, exchanging information and liaising with others at meetings, sifting through the weekly gamut of information only some of which is relevant for us'. Retrieval is supported by categorizations such as 'engineers' reports', 'environmental assessment', 'architects' drawings', etc., and other structuring conventions that reflect, for example, the time order of documents. However, the process of relating a whole host of parameters to specific design issues gives rise to another order of 1 DESARTE: The Design of Artifacts and Spaces is supported by the European Community (Esprit LTR 31870). Partners are Technische Universität Wien (A), Århus University (DK), Architekturbüro R. Lainer (A), Casella (UK), Lancaster University (UK), Mjølner Informatics (DK) and Use-It (A). We thank our colleagues for their contributions to ideas in this paper.</p><p>information structure with more flexible and dynamic categorizations. A snapshot of ongoing work to produce layout and detail drawings will illustrate this point.  Their workspaces are only a few meters apart, and each contains a desk with a computer complemented by shelves, drawing boards, and other surfaces. There are documents and drawings everywhere -on the screens, the desks next to the computers, the drawing boards, and on the floor. Some of these are being generated in the course of work; others have been assembled from various places within the physical and the electronic information space.</p><p>Joanne has a collection of layout drawings on the drawing board to her left ('x' in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>). She checks how her details affect the layout and vice versa. To do so, she turns from one drawing board to the other, bringing her sketch with her. The layout drawings are also a resource for Vic, who has reduced-size copies on his desk, but occasionally walks across to measure exact dimensions. On many occasions this gives rise to a discussion of constraints and possibilities.</p><p>Joanne knows that there will be cuts to the budget which are likely to affect the exterior space. She anticipates them by organizing the design in such a way that whole self-contained parts can be scaled down, preferably in the specifications rather than the drawings, which would be labor intensive to change. A copy of the quantity surveyor's report on her desk, stacked together with the specifications document prepared by engineers, help her in this strategic move. The specifications determine exactly how, for example, paving blocks have to be laid for the 'rumble strip', whether they are to be filled in with mortar or, more cheaply, with sand, and other details. Joanne also has a special collection of product information catalogs in a box that duplicate some of those in the general trade literature library. Having both specifications and the quantity surveyor's report open at the pages relating to rumble strips, she determines a 'favorite' paving block and a less costly alternative. Some pages of this product catalog find their way onto Vic's desk, to enable him to draw dimensions precisely to scale.</p><p>Joanne is also the project coordinator for The Deep. As well as the documents that are directly relevant for her current task, she has a timeline for the project pinned up on her wall, and a folder where information relevant to project coordination is continuously updated. She receives a number of letters and faxes that need to be included in this folder while she is working on the details. This activity is only marginally related to the work she is currently doing, yet it shares the same workspace. It is one example of a 'layering' or archaeology of physical information spaces, where each layer contains separate, often unrelated, but individually meaningful spatio-temporal assemblies of materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Spatio-Temporal Order</head><p>If we examine this sequence of activity with a view to how it might inform the potential of electronic approaches to information visualization, it is striking how the meaning and relevance of work materials to the current task find expression in their organization in time and space. Assemblies such as stacks, piles, and materials collected in a box indicate that they belong together. But more ephemeral groupings, such as the sketches located in relation to specific places in the layout drawings, or the combination of specifications, cost estimate, and product catalog, also importantly document meaningful relationships between things.</p><p>The spatio-temporal order of material assemblies is expressive of relations between documents and objects, and of their meaning and significance for the task at hand. This is an important resource for the organization of individual and cooperative work. In fact, in some respects, the configuration of materials is doing the work. However, in the physical world this spatio-temporal order is a somewhat recalcitrant ally. It is both ephemeral and persistent, with advantages and disadvantages: There are procedures that deal with the disadvantages of persistence, that 'weed out' irrelevant information, or information that has been incorporated into the design in a 'definite' form. However, eventually, many dynamic assemblies are dissolved due to the constraints of physical space, either deliberately or by accident through becoming jumbled. This is an important resource lost. Projects often stretch over long periods of time, with long breaks in-between where a set of documents that summarizes a stage of work is handed over to others -for example for a public inquiry. Eventually the architects get to continue the work. It would be useful if some of the spatio-temporal order that was constructed while the work was going on was still available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">INFORMATION VISUALIZATION</head><p>A basic requirement for effective information visualization is an extension of screen space. Some approaches mainly utilize two dimensions. Distortion-oriented techniques such as fisheye views (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>) or the Perspective Wall <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> greatly increase the amount of visible data whilst allowing for dynamic transitions between detail and context. Recent advances in technology, and approaches that draw parallels to perception in real-world information spaces, have pushed information visualization into 3D. More complex features that are bound up with people's situated discretion, e.g. a document's significance in a specific context, have also become a focus for information visualization. An early example here is Workscape TM <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Ballay reports plans to enable documents to 'acquire a … light-weight association with others just by being "put with" them', while Card et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> translate semantic proximity into spatial proximity in the Web Forager and Web Book.</p><p>The activities of one or several people within large information spaces have featured more prominently in the work of, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Populated information terrains make 3D information visualizations 'inhabitable' and constitute a different approach to information visualization. However, although these approaches begin to explore the possibilities of exploiting people's actions within information spaces for information visualization purposes, there is little support for working directly with information. Yet, it is the work that is done with information that gives rise to meaningful assemblies, as we have seen in our fieldwork example.</p><p>If we consider the practices of our design professionals with a view to supporting visualization through technology, we can distinguish four kinds of information management resources. These are useful orientations rather than hard and fast distinctions because users will in practice weave them into a seamless whole:</p><p>1. Meta-data, such as a document's date, or a project title are used as filing principles and can be automatically detected and used to govern presentation in the digital world.</p><p>2. Content serves to generate categorizations. However, these categorizations are not fixed and permanent, but depend on the context of work. Access is currently supported through 'Explorer' content search, for example. However, context support is limited to showing the directory structure.</p><p>3. Spatio-temporal configurations of materials dynamically and publicly document their interconnectedness. The digital world provides only very limited equivalents -icons and windows in an easily-cluttered two-dimensional interface.</p><p>4. Relationships between arrangements of working materials express another level of interrelations. If individual, e.g. taskrelated arrangements are thought of as a 'first-order' visualspatial organization, then combinations of such arrangements can be thought of as a 'second-order' organization.</p><p>The targeted and highly context dependent character of dynamic arrangements of work materials means that there is little if any prospect of usefully automating either the selection or the configuration of materials. The digital world is potentially well equipped, however, to capture the traces of this self-organization by users. It is the flow of the work itself that generates visible order, order that could become available as a 'save-able' and share-able resource for work in a digitally-supported world. When it comes to combinations of arrangements, the affordances of physical spaces are powerful but limited in scope. Arrangements targeted at particular tasks can be conserved and combined by multiplying workspaces, within the limits of the space and furniture available. For cooperative working, arrangements can be shared by two or more people working on the same one, or by individual but related workspaces being inter-visible within an office.</p><p>The visualization design philosophies applied respectively to these information resources can be thought of as automation, search, trace, and summation/subsumption. The Manufaktur system addresses all of them, though in what follows we concentrate on the third and fourth, which are its more original aspects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">MANUFAKTUR</head><p>The system we are designing builds on our observations of the informational affordances of physical workspaces, and the practices that design professionals have built up around them. It is conceived of as a digital 'craft workshop' or Manufaktur that extends and augments the physical workspace, enabling people to transpose familiar ways of creating dynamic order in the physical environment. Whilst mitigating some of the difficulties that arise from the constraints of the physical environment, Manufaktur also introduces new features that go beyond current practice, such as linking facilities, and support for spatio-temporal configurations of documents and objects in a three dimensional 'desktop' environment ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3)</ref>. These configurations are enhanced by the potential of electronic technologies. They can be saved, searched, shared, copied, and displayed in different ways.</p><p>Documents and 3D objects can be inserted in 3D workspaces, where they are displayed and updated. They can be arranged and grouped in relation to the task at hand. In the workspace in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> an AutoCAD drawing is grouped together with a word document that lists drawings sent to the client and three image files, for example. A billboard carries a sketch of 'The Deep', a photograph, a recently received letter, and the overall timeline for the project.</p><p>A workspace is the basic mechanism for creating and manipulating collections of objects in Manufaktur. Workspaces are sets of references to objects in a certain spatial order: the same object may thus be present in many workspaces. Workspace <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: A Manufaktur Workspace membership is visualized in several ways: by spatial proximity, color and naming (visible on the frame, which also carries the document title). Documents are 'live' in the sense that double clicking launches the document in its respective application, and changes to it will be updated within Manufaktur in near real time. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> is a view of a workspace created to show a number of features of Manufaktur. The three cylinders at the top with the downwards-pointing cones are proxy objects referring to embedded workspaces. The workspace on the left containing five documents is an example of a glass box workspace. The proxy in the middle of the figure is closed, and thus the workspace referred to is not shown. The proxy on the right refers to the billboard workspace below it. It is decorated with a 3D icon that can be used to identify the workspace even when the proxy is closed. Objects stick to the plane of the billboard but can be removed by pulling a little harder than usual. At the top center a 3D model of a building (a 3D Studio file) is inserted into the workspace. Also present as part of the workspace is a camera that can be shared between several collaborating users.</p><p>Workspaces may also contain endpoints: representations of link anchors on document-objects. By integrating and extending the Webvise <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> hypermedia system, we enable linking capability to parts of document-objects residing within Manufaktur.</p><p>To illustrate the use of proxy and workspace objects, consider a workspace containing a billboard sub-workspace. The proxy object corresponds to "the nail on which the billboard hangs", and 'lives' in the main workspace. The workspace object is the board itself, and the objects within the billboard workspace snap to this board. Manipulation of the proxy, e.g. moving it, will affect how the billboard workspace behaves in the outer workspace.</p><p>Manipulating the workspace object, e.g. by resizing it, will affect the content of the workspace, and will be reflected in all workspaces that make reference to this billboard. We describe the use of workspaces within workspaces in detailed scenarios in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Separating the proxy object from the workspace object supports separate interaction with both ends of the reference and allows multiple references to the same workspace. Open references to the same workspace are visualized by synchronized representations of the included workspace. Moreover, as workspaces may be large and contain many objects, including them directly may produce cluttered and unwieldy workspaces. We alleviate this problem by letting the proxy objects have various states of openness. If a proxy object is closed it is represented visually by a single 3D cone showing only that 'here is a reference to another workspace'</p><p>. A fully open workspace shows all the objects of the included workspace within the including workspace. Workspaces may refer arbitrarily to each other via the proxy objects except that circular references are caught: the system forbids the complete opening of a proxy that would result in a circular reference.</p><p>Technically, the Windows 2000 version of Manufaktur uses OLE linking and DCOM monikers to communicate with external applications to support live documents within the 3D workspaces. DirectX retained mode is used to maintain and draw the 3D scenes. An external SQL database serves to maintain the persistent shared state of workspaces. The SGI and Linux version of Manufaktur builds on IRIS Performer and OpenGL and is less integrated with external applications due to the lack of COM technology on those platforms. However, it interoperates with the Windows version through the shared SQL database, and allows interaction with workspaces and their objects in stereo on a TAN Holobench.</p><p>Manufaktur represents a radical approach to information visualization compared to that found in most collaborative virtual environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. As opposed to emphasizing representations of avatars for users, our emphasis is on the representation of materials with which people are working, and the actions they are taking with them. Contextual spatial arrangements of materials are used as a resource for mutual awareness of ongoing work, and Manufaktur supports real-time collaborative, distributed work across platforms, seeking to facilitate users' collective selforganization of spaces embodying the trajectory of their work.</p><p>Besides support for the creation of relations through spatial arrangements, Manufaktur also provides navigational link services through integration with and extension of the Webvise hypermedia system developed at the University of Aarhus. Webvise provides linking capability between parts of documents in external applications. This means that, e.g., Word documents stay in Word format and links are created and followed from inside Word. The links have multiple endpoints and are directional (can be followed both forward and backward). The link structure is maintained outside the linked documents, thus facilitating browsing and searching mechanisms as well as linking to and from documents to which one does not have write access.</p><p>Searching and sorting through heaps of documents based on textual patterns is already well supported by standard search mechanisms. A document found in this way may have links to relevant Manufaktur workspaces, and simply clicking on the link in the document will bring up relevant workspaces. This partly obviates the need for a specific text search mechanism within Manufaktur itself.</p><p>A 3D environment like this not only makes it possible to have many documents visible at the same time, but it also, by spatial proximity, makes it possible to indicate the (changing) relevance of a document for work-in-progress, and its relation to other objects. Our fieldwork examples show the problematic and messy ways, familiar to us all, in which layers of meaningful spatial arrangements crowd in on each other. This problem can partly be avoided in Manufaktur as a result of three features. First, there can be multiple workspaces, each targeted at a particular project or sub-project; these can be closed or minimized and later returned to, either to cope with a short-term interruption or with longer breaks in the life of a project. Second, as document objects within Manufaktur are references to the real documents (CAD documents, Excel spreadsheets etc.), copying the references does not create multiple different document versions. In contrast to the physical world, simply copying a document object from one workspace into another allows the same document or drawing to exist in several places at once. Third, through reference to other workspaces, complete contextual arrangements can be embedded into a new context. The consequence is that users can, in effect, inhabit as many 'parallel universes' in relation to their work as they care to create. This raises important and interesting questions for the fieldwork and our professional partners: 'What kinds of configurations of separate materials (first-order arrangements), but also several collections of materials in different workspaces (second-order arrangements) are there and how are they used?' These questions are best addressed through use of Manufaktur in real work. We are currently implementing it at our partners' studios. In the meantime, we draw upon scenarios of use developed in interdisciplinary workshops and on the basis of our fieldwork to inform the further design of Manufaktur.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper we have argued that it should be part of the remit of information visualization to get close to real settings of work practice. On the basis of ethnographic fieldwork examples and scenarios, we distinguished four kinds of information management resources for the purposes of organization and visualization, each with corresponding philosophies of design and means of technical realization. We described Manufaktur, a system that provides a 3D visual information space and captures the 'first-order' traces of the self-organization of users in arranging visual materials in that space. We identified how it can be important to users to manipulate these workspaces as a whole and to relate them in various ways. We described some of the powerful and flexible ways in which Manufaktur supports interconnections between workspaces.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The metaphor 'The Deep Plaza' captures some of the landscape architects' concepts.
