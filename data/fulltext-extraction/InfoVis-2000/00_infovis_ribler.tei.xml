				<p>This paper introduces a number of general methods for visualizing commonality in sets of text files. Each visualization simultaneously compares one file in the set to all other files in the set. These visualizations, which can be computed in O ¢ ¡ ¤ £ time and space, are explained and then applied to the problem of detecting plagiarism in large computer science classes. A case study is presented and sample visualizations are provided. Finally, a new interactive tool that can be used to produce and manipulate these visualizations is presented.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Computer science instructors usually require students to write their programs independently. Therefore, any nontrivial programming assignment should produce a number of unique solutions equal to the number of students submitting programs. Unfortunately, some students might not observe the rules regarding plagiarism, and copy all or part of another student's program and submit it as their own work. To reduce the chance of being detected, they sometimes change the names of variables or make other cosmetic changes, but often, in large classes where the perceived probability of detection is low, they make only the most minor alterations. Perhaps if better detection techniques were available this type of plagiarism could be effectively deterred.</p><p>This paper describes the production of visualizations that show how similar one file is to the other files in a set of files. When applied to plagiarism detection, they shows how similar one student's program is to all the other programs submitted. These "one-to-many" file visualizations can be computed in O ¥ ¡ ¤ £ time. To see how every file in a set compares to every other file in a set requires ¡ such visualizations, rather than the O ¢ ¡ § ¦ £ operations required for pairwise comparison. While these methods are particularly well suited to plagiarism detection, they are not limited to that application, and represent a general method for performing one-to-many comparisons among text files.</p><p>Visualization is especially appropriate for plagiarism detection because a high level of similarity between documents can be caused by factors other than cheating. So plagiarism detection generally requires two steps. The first step is to identify suspicious programs, and the second step is to examine sections that are similar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Categorical Patterngram (CP)</head><p>In plagiarism detection, we are attempting to identify sequences of characters that are present in more than one program. We define © as the minimum sequence length of interest. Every © -length character sequence defines an n-gram.</p><p>-grams are the sequences of ¡ characters that exist in a text file. For example, the first ¡ -grams of length three in a program that starts with the word "begin", are "beg," "egi," and "gin." We do not include spaces, carriage returns, tabs, or other non-printable characters in our ¡ -grams. The single file in a one-to-many comparison will be referred to as the base file. The entire set of files involved in the comparison will be referred to as the ensemble <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>. We define a categorical patterngram <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref> as a visualization that displays, for each character position in the the base file, the number of ensemble files that contain the </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">A Toy Example</head><p>Suppose that we have three files that contain text as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 1, 2</ref>, and 3. A patterngram that uses Toy File 0 as a base file is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>. The points in the graph have been labeled with the corresponding letters in the files. This is done only as an aid to understanding how Toy0: This is a test.  Toy2: Toy2 has little in common with the other two. This is common.  -grams "Toy0," "oy0:," "y0:T," "0:Thi," and ":This" do not occur in the other two files. The sixth, seventh, and eighth characters (plotted at -coordinates 5, 6, and 7, respectively) produce points at -coordinate three because the ¡ -grams that are initiated with those characters, "This," "hisi," and "isis," occur in all three files. Characters eight through twelve each initiate ¡ -grams that occur in one other file -in this case Toy File 1, so they are plotted at -coordinate two. The remaining characters belong to sequences that do not occur in the other files and are therefore plotted at -coordinate one. In real applications the sequence lengths of interest are typically longer than four characters. In addition, the files are typically made up of thousands of characters, so it is not possible to label each point with its corresponding letter. However, these graphs are designed simply to show  whether or not similarities exist. Another technique will be described in section 5 that shows the ¡ -grams that correspond to the similarities displayed in the patterngram.</p><p>The following notes highlight some important characteristics of the Categorical Patterngram (CP). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The Composite Categorical Patterngram</head><p>The categorical patterngram defined in the previous section shows the degree of similarity that exists between one file and the rest of the ensemble of files. The visualization presented in this section, which we call the composite categorical patterngram (CCP), shows which particular files are similar.</p><p>Each file is assigned a number in the range</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">% &amp; ' ¡ !

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">If a sequence in the base file matches multiple files in</head><p>the data set, then points will be plotted at the multiple -coordinates associated with the matching files. These points will be plotted in the interval corresponding to the position of the matching ¡ -gram in the base file. Additionally, the use of recursive hashing by cyclic polynomials <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>, provides a constant hashing time regardless of the size of © . In practice we have found the memory requirement for the algorithms to be approximately ten times larger than the memory required to store all the files in memory. Using this algorithm, an average Pentium-class machine can produce all the patterngrams for programs in an average computer science class in just a few seconds.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Pattern Text View</head><p>The pattern text view provides an additional many-to-one visualization for text files. It formats the text from the base file so that each character that begins a non-unique sequence is highlighted, either using an underlined font or using an alternative font color. The text view has a simple relationship to the patterngram. If the value of the </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Changing Variable Names</head><p>Sometimes students will change the variable names in a program in an attempt to mask plagiarized code. This technique will reduce the efficacy of the patterngrams, but will not eliminate it altogether. However, the effects of variable name changes can be defeated through the insertion of a simple preprocessing step known as tokenization. The tokenization converts all the alphanumeric strings in a program into single characters. The special characters, which include everything other than the alphanumeric characters, are left unaffected. This produces three effects. The first is that two files that contain the same programs with different variable names will produce identical patterngrams. The second effect is a reduction in the size of the data set. The third effect is that the ensemble becomes more homogeneous, so an increase in © will probably be justified. The results of our case study seem to indicate that this transformation has little adverse effect on the visualizations and has all the positive effects described.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">A Case Study</head><p>A case study was performed to see if these visualization methods could be successfully applied in a classroom situation. The students had been provided with a small sample program and asked to expand it. The sample program contained approximately 30 lines of code. The average completed program was less than 150 lines. Students submitted their programs via email, and each program received was assigned a sequential submission number. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows the patterngram . This provides a better visualization of the points in the interval 1 to 10, which is the critical range in this application. This graph is typical of a graph associated with a program that was written independently.</p></div>

These matches are caused by common words or phrases which naturally occur in independently developed programs or by the sample program that the instructor provided. Color has been added to the the displays to distinguish between the base file (blue), the infrequently matched ¡ -grams (red), and frequently matched ¡ -grams (green). <ref type="figure">Figures 8 and 9</ref> show the CP and CCP for submission number 45.

We made copies and changed all the variable names, we made copies and reversed all the lines, we even copied as few as five lines from one program to another. All of these attempts were visible in our graphs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>begins at that position.

N-grams in the base file that are common to many other files are plotted with a large -coordinate. In plagiarism detection, these ¡ -grams correspond to character sequences that naturally occur frequently without any collaboration between students.3. The sequences that may be indications of plagiarism are indicated by points that have a relatively small -coordinate greater than one. The value of the coordinate provides the viewer with an indication of where the ¡ -gram occurs in the base file. The location of the ¡ -gram in the other ensemble files is unavailable in this visualization. Perhaps the most important information in the graph is provided by the presence or absence of clusters of horizontally contiguous points. For example, a contiguous section of points plotted at indicates a section of code that is unique -a section where the majority of the points are plotted at ! " is also a good indication of independently developed code, particularly when the values that are not at # $ have relatively high -coordinates. However, the absence of points at -coordinate one for an extended section is a good indication of plagiarism. The dominant coordinate in such a section often indicates the number of collaborators involved.</figDesc></figure>
