				<p>Since novice users of visualization systems lack the knowledge and expertise in data visualization, it is a tough task for them to generate efficient and effective visualizations that allow them to comprehend information embedded in the data. Therefore, systems supporting the users to design appropriate visualizations are of great importance. The GADGET system, which has been developed in our previous study, interactively helps them design scientific visualization applications by presenting appropriate MVE prototypes according to the specification of the visualization goals expressed mainly with the Wehrend matrix. This paper attempts to extend this approach in order to develop a system named GADGET/IV, which is intended to provide the users with an environment for semi-automatic design of information visualization applications. To this end, a novel goal-oriented taxonomy of information visualization techniques is presented. Also an initial design of the system architecture and user assistance flow is described. The usefulness of the GADGET/IV system is illustrated with example problems of Web site access frequency analysis.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In the rapid growth of widely accessible data due to the development of the Global Information Infrastructure (GII) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, efficient and effective data exploration facilities are needed. The recent progress in visual computing technologies has enabled us to visualize large amounts of data interactively. Many techniques for facilitating the user's un-derstanding of and insight into the data have been proposed, and a new research field, termed information visualization, has emerged for the pursuit of post-WIMP user interfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p><p>One of the important roots of information visualization is scientific visualization, where in the past decade, easy-touse visual programming environments, termed Modular Visualization Environments (MVEs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, have been commonly used. MVEs allow the user to follow a rough guideline to select and connect built-in functional units, called modules, and construct his/her own visualization applications, called networks. The reusability and customizability of networks make MVEs the de facto standard for scientific visualization. These same merits of the use of MVEs are expected to be found equally in the field of information visualization.</p><p>In practical situations, however, since most of the MVE users are not visineers (visualization specialists) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, they are not always familiar with how to map their datasets to proper graphical representations. Consequently, it has been frequently reported in many scientific and engineering disciplines that the powerful set of built-in mapping modules is not fully used to construct necessary visualizations for realizing the intrinsic nature of their datasets. The situation is supposed to become much worse in information visualization, because potential users in the GII are true novices at computations, and the population is predicted to reach O(10 8 ), relative to O(10 4 ) users in scientific disciplines <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Therefore, a certain mechanism needs to be incorporated into MVEs, which makes use of heuristics and expertise of visineers to offer support for the user in designing his/her information visualization applications with MVEs.</p><p>The GADGET (Goal-oriented Application Design Guid-ance for module visualization EnvironmenTs) system, which has been developed in our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, interactively helps the user design scientific visualization applications. GADGET does this by presenting appropriate techniques, algorithms and examples, primarily according to the specification of the visualization goals expressed with a goal-oriented taxonomy, called Wehrend Matrix, of existing visualization techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. The purpose of this paper is to extend this approach in order to propose the next version of the system named GADGET/IV (Information Visualization), which is intended to assist the user in visualizing abstract data stored in databases as well as simulated/sampled data in scientific and engineering disciplines. The basic idea for the extension is to augment the goaloriented design guidance capability by combining with the Wehrend matrix another taxonomy proposed by Shneiderman <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, called data Type by Task Taxonomy (TTT).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">GADGET/IV Taxonomy</head><p>This section is devoted to the description of a goaloriented taxonomic approach which the GADGET/IV system adopts to realize the MVE-based application design guidance. Section 2.1 gives the basic idea of the original Wehrend matrix, and discusses the enrichment of the vocabulary used in the new Wehrend matrix for classifying information visualization techniques. Section 2.2 describes how the enriched Wehrend matrix is combined with the Shneiderman TTT to refine the goal-oriented specification of information visualization design directives. Section 2.3 formulates the GADGET/IV user assistance in the design of MVE applications for information visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Enriching Wehrend Matrix</head><p>As the primary concept for the visineers' knowledge representations, GADGET/IV relies heavily on the Wehrend matrix, which was originally proposed by Wehrend and Lewis, as a simple, but powerful goal-oriented taxonomy of visualization techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The concept was utilized for indexing a collection of over one hundred data visualizations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Its feasibility was also proven by the GAD-GET system <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the predecessor of GADGET/IV. Here, this taxonomic knowledge of visineers is reused at the first stage of interaction with the user to specify his/her design directives.</p><p>The Wehrend matrix hypothesizes that the identification of a visualization goal (what the user expects to extract from a given dataset) suggests appropriate techniques to use in achieving that goal. In the Wehrend matrix, visualization goals are identified simply by pairing words (verbs and objects) from two types of vocabulary lists, i.e., actions and targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . The classification of actions distinguishes problems in terms of the representation goals, while the classification of targets groups techniques based on the nature of objects in the target domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>In order to make the approach accepted in the field of information visualization as well, an enriched vocabulary for the set of actions is considered on the basis of a related literature survey. We collected candidates for actions from 200 representative information visualizations in references (InfoVis symposium series and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>). Then, refining them through the use of Roget's Thesaurus <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> yielded the following action set A, comprised of fourteen verbs and verbal phrases: f"Associate", "Classify", "Categorize", "Compare", "Emerge structure of", "Find structure of", "Identify feature of", "Rank", "Reveal change of", "Reveal clustering of", "Reveal distribution of ", "Reveal patterns of ", "Reveal relationships of", "Reveal structure of"g.</p><p>Meanwhile, for the set of targets D, the vocabulary used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is again adopted herein. The set D includes seven kinds of targets: f"Scalar", "Nominal", "Direction", "Shape", "Position", "Spatially Extended Region or Object", "Structure"g. An example of a visualization goal is "Categorize nominal".</p><p>Once a visualization goal is specified with a combination of action and target(s), we can associate a set of information visualization techniques which meet the goal. We abstracted the collected set of techniques from the above-mentioned references into a hierarchy of techniques as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> by referring to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. For example, "PieChart" can be selected as one of the primary techniques to achieve the goal "Categorize nominal".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Combining Enriched Wehrend Matrix with Shneiderman TTT</head><p>The data Type by Task Taxonomy (TTT) was proposed by Shneiderman <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> for the specification of information visualization tasks. The Shneiderman TTT is akin to the Wehrend matrix in that any visualization tasks are specifiable by a combination of data types (targets) and tasks (actions). The data types of the TTT characterize the taskdomain information objects and are organized by the problems that the users are trying to solve. The data types include f"1D", "2D", "3D", "Temporal", "MultiDimensional", "Tree", "Network"g. The tasks in the TTT are taskdomain information actions that the users wish to perform.</p><p>The tasks include f"Overview", "Zoom", "Filter", "Detailson-demand", "Relate", "History", "Extract"g. By accounting for the structural similarity between the two types of taxonomies, we attempted to combine them to construct the GADGET/IV taxonomy of information visualization tech- niques. Note that herein the Shneiderman TTT should be combined orthogonally with the enriched Wehrend matrix to realize the progressive approach to visual data exploration. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> shows a rough sketch of the refined goal-oriented taxonomy adopted by GADGET/IV, where the mutual relationships between the Shneiderman TTT and the enriched Wehrend matrix are clarified. To summarize:</p><p>Any visualization goals specified with the enriched Wehrend matrix can be viewed as subtasks of the "Overview" task in the Shneiderman TTT.</p><p>"Relate" is supposed to be realized implicitly with Wehrend's actions: "Associate" and "Reveal relationship of".</p><p>Once the visualization goal is achieved, the user is allowed to manipulate the overview image in a progressive manner with the three specific kinds of actions: "Filter"ing-out data with little relevance to current tasks; "Zoom"ing into areas of interest; and getting "Details-on-demand".</p><p>The functionalities corresponding to "History" and "Extract" are offered by the system browser in itself, which reuses either all or part of visualization results.</p><p>As for the vocabulary of target data types, "Tree" and "Network" data types can be treated as subtypes of "Structure" in the Wehrend matrix.</p><p>A new item Dimension is defined independently of the target data types to describe Dimension (the number of independent data variables involved) with a given dataset. Then, "1D", "2D", "3D", and "MultiDimensional" in the TTT can be treated uniformly as domain elements of Dimension. Also "Temporal" is treated as an external item to specify whether the temporal axis is needed.</p><p>Geographical is introduced as another external item to specify whether geographical maps are utilized in the visualization, since they serve as an important criterion for selecting appropriate visualization techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Formulating GADGET/IV Taxonomy</head><p>Having refined the taxonomy, we are now in a good position to formulate the GADGET/IV taxonomy and the mechanism of user assistance in the design of MVE applications.</p><p>Considering that the action "Associate" requires more than one target 2 , the set of visualization goals P is defined generally as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P A 2 D :</formula><p>The set of visualization goals can serve as an effective index system to select matched visualization techniques. Specifically, the set function K C of classification is defined by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">K C : P 7 ! 2 V</formula><p>where V denotes the set of techniques. For example, the set value for K C ("Compare", "Scalar") includes "Scatter-Plot", "BarChart", "LineChart", "Particle Advector", and "Streamline". </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">K V : ( P O T G ) 7 ! 2 V :</formula><p>For instance, the set value for K V ("Compare", "Scalar", "1D", "Yes", "No") includes "ScatterPlot", "BarChart", and "LineChart". In order to make it possible to select appropriate MVE modules, the set function K N for choosing module networks can be introduced so as to have type:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">K N : V 7 ! 2 N (M)</formula><p>where M is the set of principal mapping modules offered by an MVE, and N(M) is a class of directed graph with the elements of M as nodes, and denotes the set of networks.</p><p>This is because in general for each of the visualization techniques, there are more than one known implementations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">System Overview of GADGET/IV</head><p>This section overviews the GADGET/IV system with a special focus on the main flow of design guidance and the entire system architecture.</p><p>Information visualization techniques are assumed to be classified in advance in terms of the taxonomy formulated in Section 2.3. This classification makes techniques orderly, and is useful for selecting the effective categories of MVE visualization module networks.</p><p>The behavior of the GADGET/IV system can be described with six steps. The system first allows the user to specify his/her visualization goals in the directives (step 1), and shows the list of the recommended visualization techniques (step 2). If the user needs, he/she can consult the system to obtain empirical knowledge about the application domains and prior application examples corresponding to each technique retrieved (step 3). Each of the visualization techniques presented in step 2 has a corresponding MVE module network. The selected network, once loaded to an MVE, is executable and modifiable (step 4). The recommended network is "full fledged": it is comprised of a principal module that implements the selected mapping technique, and supporting modules that implement pre/post processes such as database access, filtering, resizing, rendering, and image display. Hence, the user can apply the suggested network to his/her own dataset on the spot (step 5) to get an overview image (step 6). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> shows schematically the fundamental architecture of the GADGET/IV system with internal data/control transfers. GADGET/IV consists of an MVE, a GUI, a knowledge-base system, a querying subsystem, and a dedicated system manager loosely coupling these components.</p><p>The system manager is the kernel to control the transition of the system, such as retrieval from the knowledge-base, display of the results through the GUI, and transfer of module networks to the MVE. The knowledge-base system is consulted through the querying subsystem at the transition from one state to another. The GUI and the MVE are the accessible components for the user. The GUI passes input data to the system manager, and shows the retrieved knowledge back to the user, and the like. The MVE allows the user to modify a network and its properties.</p><p>The current version of the GADGET/IV system has been implemented by using Microsoft Access as the knowledgebase management system, Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 as the GUI builder, and AVS/Express5.0 as the MVE, all running on a Dell PC Server (CPU: PentiumIII 500MHz, RAM: 768MB, OS: Windows/NT4.0).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Case Studies</head><p>This section demonstrates how the user guidance mechanism based on the refined goal-oriented taxonomy works to select appropriate information visualization techniques. As the source data for three case studies, a log dataset on October 1, 1999 comprising 2,680 requests to the Web site of our laboratory was taken. This dataset was extracted from server logs by a specific script to store into a log database. Although HTTP server log files contain details on the visitors to the site, there are too many data to capture the access patterns. Judicious choice of log data visualization techniques can provide a more intuitive means to comprehend such data.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Case 1</head><p>First suppose that the user wants to know which organization accesses the top page of the laboratory's Web site frequently. The visualization goal is interpreted in the enriched Wehrend matrix (step 1). In this example, action and target are "Categorize" and "Nominal", respectively. Dimension is set to "1D". Both items Temporal and Geographical are set to "No" <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4(a)</ref>).</p><p>According to the input design directive, the set of appropriate techniques is retrieved from the knowledge-base. The hierarchy of information visualization techniques in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> is shown in the distorted form of the cone trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> (step 2). In this case, "PieChart" is displayed as the most recommended technique at the front <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4(b)</ref>). Each technique is attached with three menu button icons: to show corresponding application domains; application examples; and the MVE network (from left to right). A subwindow showing the application domains related to "PieChart" pops up on the cone tree window in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4(b)</ref>. Also, a Web browser window can show thumbnails and hotlink URLs of "PieChart" applications (step 3).</p><p>By clicking the right button "Apply", the corresponding MVE's network is loaded and appears in the MVE window (step 5). The top three modules are used to open, issue a corresponding query to, and reformat the retrieved data from the log database <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4(c)</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4(d)</ref> shows the resulting image, from which we can find at a glance that about one fourth of the accesses on that day came from educational organizations (step 6).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Case 2</head><p>Next, consider that the user wants to know more details on the access log data by comparing each user's page to find out which organization accesses it frequently. In this example, the action and target may be "Compare" and "Nominal", respectively. As the independent nominals include the type of organizations and page owners, Dimension is set to "2D". Both items Temporal and Geographical still remain "No". As the recommended information visualization techniques, "BarChart", "LineChart" and "ScatterPlot" are retrieved this time from the knowledge-base. Suppose that the user selected "CityScape", which is the subtechnique of "BarChart", and whose MVE network is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 5(a)</ref>. The generated overview image is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 5(b)</ref>, from which it turns out that most accesses from educational organizations were concentrated on a couple of page owners.</p><p>Next, the user can interactively manipulate the overview image. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 5(c) and (d)</ref> show the different views of the same dataset, which are created by performing filtering, and zooming and details-on-demand operations on the overview image, respectively. The former gives a collection of data where the total number of requests is more than 100. A slider can be used as an interactive tool to adjust the threshold value. The latter image zooms the scope into a narrow area of interest. Here again, interactive scope adjustment is very helpful. Also displayed is the detailed information on a specific page owner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Case 3</head><p>Lastly, consider a situation where the user wants to know the day long time series of the access frequency to the top page of the laboratory's Web site. The visualization goal can be specified as "Reveal change of scalar". Dimension is set to "1D", and the item Temporal is set to "Yes" this time. "LineChart", and "ScatterPlot" are retrieved as the recommended information visualization techniques. The MVE network of "LineChart" and its resulting image are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 6(a)</ref> and (b), respectively. The daily access profile can be easily understood from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 6(b)</ref>, which shows that a large number of accesses occurred in the nighttime.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Concluding Notes</head><p>In this paper, we have presented GADGET/IV as an information visualization support system which provides the user with a semi-automatic environment to design information visualization applications using an MVE. Through the three case studies with a Web site access frequency dataset, it was demonstrated that the system can capture the different views of information from the same dataset according to the user's specifications of visualization goals.</p><p>The following are left as future issues: 1. Although the GADGET/IV system provides a simple, but powerful means for visualization goal specification, additional user navigation mechanisms are needed to fill the gap between the user's intuitive requirements for visualization in practical cases and interpretable design directives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>The technique classification function K V should return a subset of V as a sorted list of techniques in the order of effectiveness, which could be based primarily on further literature surveys and empirical test uses.</p><p>3. An effective tool is required for assisting the user in authoring queries to access target databases without any knowledge about SQL programming. The methods within MWMD <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> would be useful in developing a module-based query formulation interface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.</head><p>Interactive functionalities such as filtering, sorting, zooming, and details-on-demand vary slightly according to the recommended information visualization techniques. For example, for zooming of tree or network datasets, non-linear distorted transformation techniques such as fisheyes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> are more suitable than linear viewing techniques. GADGET/IV should suggest to the user which types of interactive functionalities accompany each of the recommended techniques.</p><p>5. Although the current goal-oriented taxonomy can serve as the guideline to select desirable data mappings from a source data form to visual structures, the details on how each of the data variables is characterized with visual mapping attributes can not be suggested. By using a design space taxonomy of information visualizations proposed by Card, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, a variety of candidates for visual structures could be suggested to obtain an overview of the nature of a given data. Also it is a challenging theme to exploit the merits of the taxonomy in terms of the visual object-guided similarity search for information visualizations.</p><p>6. Upstream design assistance is also of extreme importance. For example, meta data (DD/D) consultation makes it possible to derive data forms which are more suitable for effective visual mapping, as achieved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>A hierarchy of information visualization techniques used in the GADGET/IV system.</figDesc></figure>
