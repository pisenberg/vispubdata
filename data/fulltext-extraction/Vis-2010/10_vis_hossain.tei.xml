<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The core of volume visualization and volume rendering has been the extraction and presentation of the salient features in the volume. Often times, the data at hand has been corrupted by noise (e.g. Ultrasound <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[39]</ref>, MRI or data range scanners <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[32]</ref>) or the salient features of interest are fine structures, like the tubular vessel structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20]</ref> or the cell walls in microscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref>. Usually, these types of data can not be properly processed by a volume rendering pipeline, since both transfer function based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[33]</ref> as well as topological approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> will break down and not yield a comprehensible view of the data. In all of these cases, a pre-processing step is needed in order to prepare the data for visualization and analysis purposes. A very powerful framework for this purpose is diffusion.</p><p>A simple Gaussian blur usually destroys a lot of features together with noise artifacts in an isotropic / indiscriminate way. Hence, the concept of anisotropic diffusion has been introduced by Perona and Malik in 1990 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26]</ref> (summarized in Section 2) and has become one of the most popular techniques in image and volume processing. Many different variants of anisotropic diffusion have since been introduced. One of the core drawbacks, however, of any diffusion model has been</p><p>• The authors are with the Graphics, Usability, and Visualization <ref type="bibr">(GrUVi)</ref> Lab, School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby BC V5A 1S6, Canada, E-mail: {zha13,torsten}@cs.sfu.ca. the non-intuitive setting of some parameters attached with it. This is typically rooted in the fact that the diffusion is controlled by the gradient magnitude of the underlying function. In most practical cases the distribution of gradient strength of salient boundaries is not known a priori. In fact a single gradient magnitude threshold rarely defines all the salient features within the data. Hence, the diffusion algorithm often needs to be re-fined for each new data set or each new application.</p><p>In this paper we attempt to address these problems of the existing non-linear diffusion techniques. Our main contributions are:</p><p>• We derive an anisotropic diffusion equation with the following features (see Section 3.1):</p><p>-No diffusion is performed along the gradient direction.</p><p>-Diffusion is stopped around the edge locations.</p><p>-Diffusion is performed anisotropically along the direction of the minimum curvature. -Isotropic diffusion on the tangent plane of the normal in regions where the local iso-surface is isotropic in shape.</p><p>• We create a stopping function, that is based on the second derivative in the gradient direction, which allows us to create a robust diffusion algorithm, insensitive to parameter tuning (see Section 3.1).</p><p>Section 4 introduces an efficient way to compute our diffusion equation using the principal curvatures and therefore reducing the computational burden inherit in the scheme. In Section 5 we will discuss some properties of our proposed diffusion model along with aptly demonstrating its advantage over the gradient based method <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20]</ref>. We will follow this by demonstrating the de-noising property of our model in Section 6. In Section 6.1, we will perform an empirical analysis of convergence and stability and then critically compare the de-noising performance of our method with a very recent anisotropic diffusion based de-noising filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref>. Finally, in Section 7 we will discuss some potential applications in volume visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PREVIOUS WORK</head><p>Throughout the paper we will use the notation f and t to denote a real valued scalar function and the time dimension respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The Perona and Malik Model</head><p>To alleviate the problem of isotropic diffusion, which is similar to Gaussian blurring, Perona and Malik <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26]</ref> proposed an anisotropic diffusion scheme, which we will refer to as the PM model for brevity, given by the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∂ f ∂t = div (h( ∇ f )∇ f )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The function h( ∇ f ), termed stopping function, is usually a monotonically decreasing function with function values around one for smaller arguments. Perona and Malik <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26]</ref> also proposed two such h functions and one of them is given below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">h(α) = e − 1 2 ( α S ) 2 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>With such an h(•) function this approach does tend to preserve certain edges given the parameter S in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>is chosen carefully which is often not trivial and data dependent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Generalizations in 2D</head><p>Carmona et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref> generalized the classical PM <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26]</ref> model (in 2D) in a more intuitive way -performing diffusions along the gradient and the orthogonal direction to the gradient as given by the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">∂ f ∂t = c(•) a(•) f nn + b(•) f vv<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Here a and b are some scalar functions modulating diffusion along the gradient direction n = ∇ f / ∇ f and the orthogonal direction to the gradient, v = n ⊥ respectively. Here, c is a scalar function, usually called the stopping function, that modulates the overall diffusion. The notation f nn and f vv denotes the directional second derivative along the gradient direction n and the orthogonal direction v respectively.  A straightforward extension of the PM model to 3D, as it was generalized by Gerig et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11]</ref>, remains isotropic on the tangent plane of the gradient. This isotropic behavior on the tangent plane may destroy fine tubular structures which are vital, for example, in 3D medical imaging. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> clearly shows how tubular structures get destroyed when diffusion is performed isotropically on the tangent plane without taking principal curvatures 1 into account. Therefore Weickert <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[37]</ref> classifies the PM model and higher order diffusion processes as non-linear rather than anisotropic. Thus far, the majority of previous work on these higher order PDEs are based on 2D solutions. On the other hand, a true anisotropic diffusion in arbitrary dimension is usually derived from the diffusion tensor notation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[38]</ref> and has the following form:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Extensions to 3D</head><formula xml:id="formula_3">∂ f ∂t = div(D∇ f )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>were D is a matrix known as diffusion tensor.</p><p>To address this, Krissian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20]</ref> proposed a true anisotropic diffusion model (referred to as KM model in the remainder of the paper) whereby diffusion would be performed primarily along the direction of the minimum curvature. However, their underlying formulation was based on that of the gradient based PM model. They have a gradient threshold parameter k and the edges in a volume get implicitly defined by locations where ∇ f &gt; k. However, the tuning of this parameter is difficult and very much data and application dependent. Different values for this parameter can lead to drastically different smoothing effects as we will demonstrate later. Therefore the KM model inherits similar problems related to this threshold parameter as the classical PM model. Nonetheless, the KM model based on principal curvatures is truly anisotropic in nature. In a later work, Krissian <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[18]</ref> proposed a flux-based anisotropic diffusion which is based on a directional first derivative, i.e. the gradient measured along a direction vector, while the author himself acknowledged the difficulty of choosing a correct threshold parameter for this directional first derivative.</p><p>Recently Mosaliganti et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref> reaffirm the problems of the gradient threshold based stopping function as found in PM or KM models and proposed a new anisotropic diffusion in 3D that is able to automatically detect and enhance specifically plate like structures in a 3D microscopy image of cell membranes. Beside being specific to a particular problem domain, i.e. detecting cell membranes which are largely planar, their method has at least four different user tunable parameters which makes it hard to apply in a practical setting.</p><p>Therefore, the problem of developing a robust general purpose anisotropic diffusion that respects edges in a 3D volume in a meaningful way remains open.</p><p>On the other hand, several interesting works have been done on anisotropic diffusion using level sets, for example Nemitz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[25]</ref> evolved a separate level set function to capture the tubular structures of 3D angiography data. This work is different in the sense that the level set function attempts to restore tubular structure using shape priors even when they may be broken. Other interesting level set methods were proposed by Preusser et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[28]</ref> and Tasdizen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[32]</ref> where diffusion is performed on a level set and the definition of edge is based on curvatures that is measured on the surface of the level set. This is different from our method where edge is defined by the directional second derivative along gradient and this is measured across level sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Denoising</head><p>A variant of anisotropic diffusion, also known as SRAD, has been developed to specifically de-noise speckle noise in 2D by Yu and Action <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[40]</ref>, which was then extended to 3D by Krissian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[21]</ref> and Sun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[31]</ref>. Both SRAD and 3D SRAD use a local statistical measure to define the stopping function. Very recently Krissian and Aja-Fernández <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref> proposed a noise-driven anisotropic diffusion that is able to remove Rician noise from a 3D MRI volume, and this method too uses statistical measures similar to that of the 3D SRAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[21]</ref>. Both of these methods require the user to specify a region of interest for the estimation of noise.</p><p>State-of-the art image de-noising techniques are often based on techniques such as bilateral filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[34]</ref>, mean-shift filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[10]</ref>, or non-local means <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>. These techniques are often related to diffusion processes. Barash et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> showed that bilateral filtering, mean-shift, and non-linear diffusion are indeed equivalent and use gradient magnitude to decide on the amount of diffusion/smoothing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PROPOSED ANISOTROPIC DIFFUSION</head><p>Kindlmann and Durkin <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref> used the directional second derivative along the normal direction as a measure for edge locations. They pointed out that, for a simple 1D case, an edge could be modeled using the error function <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref> as plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>. This is a fair assumption as all measuring devices are band-limited and so sharp edges get convolved with a Gaussian type point spread function upon sampling. Therefore an edge location can be defined by the zerocrossing of the second derivative, a technique commonly used in computer vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[22]</ref>. The same idea can be applied in 3D by measuring the directional second derivative along the normal direction and checking for zerocrossing to define the edge/boundary locations.</p><p>For the rest of the paper we will restrict our attention to a 3D scalar function f : R 3 → R. We will use the notation f v to denote a directional first derivative along a unit vector v which is simply given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f v = ∇ f , v , where •,</formula><p>• denotes the inner product. Similarly, we will use the notation f vv to denote a directional second derivative measured along a unit vector v and this is given by f vv = v T Hv, where H is the 3D Hessian (see Section A of the Appendix in the supplementary material for details). Therefore, using the notation n = ∇ f / ∇ f as the normal vector we will denote the directional second derivative along the normal with f nn .</p><p>In the following subsection we will derive a PDE with the following objectives in mind:</p><p>O-1 No diffusion will be performed along the gradient direction.</p><p>This is one of the major differences our proposed diffusion model has with that of the classical ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">26]</ref>. An edge in a 3D volume will be a surface which is perpendicular to the normal n. Not diffusing along n prevents blurring across an edge.</p><p>O-2 Diffusion will be stopped around the edge locations. Diffusion can be stopped in locations where f vv = 0, a condition which will be satisfied in both constant homogeneous regions and edge locations. However, stopping diffusion in constant homogeneous regions creates no problem as diffusion in such regions would not have any effect.</p><p>O-3 Diffusion will be performed anisotropically along the direction of the minimum curvature. In accordance to the work of Krissian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20]</ref>, this motivation was derived from the fact that fine tubular structures, e.g. blood vessels in a CT scan, get preserved.</p><p>O-4 Diffuse isotropically on the tangent plane of the normal n in regions where the local iso-surface has similar principal curvatures. On the surface of a sphere, for example, where both the principal curvatures are fairly close to each other, it makes more sense to diffuse isotropically on the tangent plane of n, rather than choosing one direction, which might lead to undesirable artifacts, as is the case with Krissian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Our PDE Model</head><p>Consider a simple 1D heat equation as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">∂ f ∂t = c f xx (5)</formula><p>The solution of the above Equation (5) can be approximated very well by convolving the function locally with a 1D Gaussian kernel. We will use this insight to design our new anisotropic diffusion in 3D with the goals described in the previous subsection in mind. In 3D, we can use the directional derivatives along the directions given by three orthonormal bases, r 1 , r 2 and n at a point and write our diffusion equation as the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">∂ f ∂t = h(•) f r 1 r 1 + g(•) f r 2 r 2 + w(•) f nn (6)</formula><p>where h(•), g(•) and w(•) are some scalar functions and the vector n is the normal direction. We emphasize that the PDE model given in Equation <ref type="formula">6</ref>is different from the diffusion tensor model <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. At this point we will take the vectors r 1 and r 2 to be the directions associated with the minimum curvature, κ 1 , and maximum curvature, κ 2 , respectively such that |κ 1 | ≤ |κ 2 |. By definition, the vectors r 1 , r 2 and n form an orthonormal bases and thus fit our proposed diffusion model. We will also set the scalar functions such that g(</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">•) = τh(•) and w(•) = ηh(•) where τ, η ∈ [0, 1].</formula><p>With this setup, Equation <ref type="formula">6</ref>can be re-written:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">∂ f ∂t = h(•)( f r 1 r 1 + τ f r 2 r 2 + η f nn )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Without referring to the exact argument of the scalar function h(•) yet, Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">7</ref>models an anisotropic diffusion which can be intuitively thought of as the summation of the local convolutions of three different 1D Gaussian kernels oriented along the three associated vector fields (compare each term of the diffusion with Equation <ref type="formula">5</ref>). The amount of diffusion along the maximum curvature direction r 2 , and the normal direction n are modulated by τ and η respectively, while diffusion is always performed along the minimum curvature direction r 1 and finally the overall diffusion is modulated by the scalar function h(•), which we will call the stopping function.</p><p>We will set η = 0 for the rest of the paper to achieve objective O-1. To fulfill objectives O-3 and O-4 together we will replace the notation τ with τ ρ which is defined by the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">τ ρ = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ κ 1,ρ κ 2,ρ 2λ where |κ 2,ρ | &gt; 0, λ ∈ Z 1 κ 2,ρ = 0<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where the quantities, κ 1,ρ (the minimum curvature) and κ 2,ρ (the maximum curvature), are computed from a smoothed version of the data f ρ with a Gaussian filter having a small variance ρ 2 . The technique of taking measurements from a smoothed volume f ρ is common in many PDE based methods specially under noisy conditions and we will discuss the effect of having a small ρ in section Section 6. We will use the notation ρ = 0 to imply that f was used to compute the curvatures instead of the smoothed version f ρ . With the above definition, τ ρ drops quickly to values very close to 0 whenever the maximum curvature |κ 2,ρ | is higher than the minimum curvature |κ 1,ρ |, i.e. the surface is not isotropic. In this case, diffusion is performed primarily along the minimum curvature direction r 1 . For an isotropic surface where |κ 1,ρ | = |κ 2,ρ | and a degenerate case, where |κ 2,ρ | = 0 (note that |κ 1,ρ | ≤ |κ 2,ρ |), τ ρ gets assigned to 1 which amounts to performing simple isotropic diffusion on the tangent plane of n. The exponent of Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">8</ref>is always an even integer which makes sure that we are comparing only the absolute values of the curvatures.</p><p>Objective O-2 can be addressed by computing the second derivative along the gradient direction, f nn and stop diffusion whenever f nn ≈ 0. To model this we can define the function h(•) such that it is continuous and approaches 0 for an argument close to 0 and 1 otherwise. For this we can simply modify the functions proposed by PM <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26]</ref> as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">h(α) = 1 − e − ln( 10 9 )( α σ ) 2 = 1 − (0.9) ( α σ ) 2 , σ ∈ R (9)</formula><p>The scaling factor of ln (10/9) (Equation (9)) is there so that we have h(α) &lt; 0.1, which we considered to be very little diffusion, whenever |α| &lt; σ . This allows a more intuitive relationship between the argument α and the parameter σ . However, for a different purpose, this scaling factor could be changed or just simply be omitted. Using f nn as the input to h(•) we essentially fulfill all four objectives we had set for ourselves. We finally present our anisotropic diffusion PDE by the following equation: </p><formula xml:id="formula_11">∂ f ∂t = h( f nn )( f r 1 r 1 + τ ρ f r 2 r 2 + η f nn )<label>(10)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">IMPLEMENTATION</head><p>Krissian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20]</ref> have shown that we could skip computing the principal curvature directions, which usually involves expensive eigenvalue decomposition of some matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">35]</ref>, altogether and compute the quantities f r 1 r 1 and f r 2 r 2 directly using the following relationships:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">f r 1 r 1 = − ∇ f κ 1 , f r 2 r 2 = − ∇ f κ 2<label>(11)</label></formula><p>In the above, κ 1 and κ 2 can be computed in a straightforward fashion by the following</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">κ i = K ± K 2 − G, i ∈ {1, 2} : |κ 1 | ≤ |κ 2 |<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where G and K are the Gaussian and Mean curvatures respectively. These can be computed directly from the first and second derivatives as given by Goldman <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">G = 1 ∇ f 4 ∇ f T H c ∇ f K = 1 2 ∇ f 3 ∇ f T H∇ f − ∇ f 2 trace(H)</formula><p>where H c (see Section A of the Appendix in the supplementary material for details) is the co-factor matrix of the Hessian H. Computation of both G and K can be implemented very efficiently without performing the actual matrix multiplications by expanding the equations as summations first (see Section B of the Appendix in the supplementary material).</p><p>Taking the relations given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(11)</ref>, Equation (10) can be written more compactly and in matrix form as the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">∂ f ∂t = −h(n T Hn) ∇ f (κ 1 + τ ρ κ 2 ) − ηn T Hn<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Note that κ 1 and κ 2 in the above equation are measured from f whereas τ ρ is measured from f ρ where ρ is usually 1 when diffusion is used for the purpose of de-noising (see Section 6) and 0 otherwise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>In this section we will first demonstrate the shortcomings of the classical anistropic diffusion, proposed by Krissian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20]</ref> -referred to as KM model for brevity -which in turn was based on the gradient magnitude, i.e. PM model <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26]</ref> and compare the results with our novel approach. Next we will show the impact of the parameter σ , in Equation (9), of our method on the final output. We will then follow the discussion showing diffusion results using higher order derivative filters and finally provide empirical analysis of stability and convergence of our PDE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Parameter Settings</head><p>For all the diffusion experiments performed in this section we have set λ = 2 in Equation (8). Voxel spacing was assumed to be 1 in all directions and scalar values, which ranged between [0, 255], in the 3D volumes were not scaled. For the time step we have chosen Δt = 0.05, and η = 0 (no diffusion along the gradient direction) for the rest of the paper and we have used f without smoothing, i.e. ρ = 0. For all derivative estimations we have used the standard second-order stencils unless specified otherwise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">The Impact of the Stopping Function</head><p>In this section we will use the Sheep's Heart dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[29]</ref> and demonstrate the sensitivity of the KM method to the parameter chosen. Likewise, we will show the robustness of our novel method with respect to its parameter and yet give a compelling example of its importance.</p><p>In our experiment, we chose Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>and Equation <ref type="formula">9</ref>as the stopping functions in the KM method and h(α) in our new proposed method, respectively, and used 35 iterations for both diffusion models. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> demonstrates the sensitivity of the KM method to its parameter k. The yellow circle marks an area where regions of small gradient magnitude merge with regions of higher gradient magnitude (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4b</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 4c</ref>, which was diffused with the KM model at k = 40 shows the selective nature of this method. Regions with a low gradient magnitude diffused much more compared to regions with higher gradient magnitude. On the other hand, regions having very low gradient magnitude (the blue circle) got diffused the most. As the value of k was increased to 80 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4d</ref>) a dramatically different output was produced. Here, regions inside the blue circle got diffused to the point of loosing structure while those with higher gradient magnitude (the lower part of the yellow circle) just started to get diffused. We also refer readers to <ref type="figure">Figure 1 (a-c)</ref> to see this selective nature of the KM method based on gradient magnitude and the resulting artifacts after 100 iterations were performed. A single iso-surface rendering may not tell the full story sometimes and for this reason we provide 2D slices of the same experiment (as performed for <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>) in Section D of the Appendix in the supplementary material.</p><p>On the other hand, our method has been found to be more robust with respect to its parameter σ . Unlike the KM model, smoothing of an iso-surface in our approach is performed consistently without any discrimination based on the gradient magnitudes. Since the parameter σ in our model is tied to the directional second derivative, f nn , it has a more intuitive impact on the overall diffusion process; i.e. decreasing σ amounts to smoothing a larger range of f nn . This can be thought of removing high frequencies from the 3D volume except near the boundaries between relatively homogeneous regions, where f nn approaches zero and the stopping function h( f nn ) approaches zero too making the diffusion stop (see Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(13)</ref>). The sensitivity of parameters in both the KM and our proposed model is further illustrated in two separate animations we provide as supplementary materials (KM K effect.avi and sigma effect.avi respectively). For both animations, we only changed the parameters k and σ for the KM and our model respectively and ran 35 iterations of diffusion while all the other parameters were kept the same.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Significance of σ</head><p>In our previous examples, we have demonstrated the robustness of our new diffusion model with regards to the parameter σ . However, this robustness is observed for points away from zero. In this section, we argue with an appropriate example that the role of σ around zero is critical. A quick look at Equation (13) immediately reveals that having the stopping function h(•) always evaluate to 1 with η = 0 makes the diffusion similar to the well known mean curvature motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[23]</ref> (assuming τ ≈ 1, i.e. on isotropic surfaces, like a sphere) except for the extra modulating term of ∇ f . However, on the surface of a sphere, for example, ∇ f is constant and simplifying h(•) to 1 essentially makes Equation (13) a mean curvature motion diffusion in such a case. Mean curvature motion is a well studied diffusion scheme where spherical structures shrink until they disappear, which may not be desirable when preserving structures in a 3D volume.</p><p>To verify this we created a phantom dataset with several spherical regions of different sizes and diffused it once by making h(•) a constant 1 and the other by using Equation (9) with σ = 40. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> aptly demonstrates the significance of the parameter σ . When the phantom data was diffused with σ = 40 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5c</ref>) the basic structure of the original data, <ref type="figure">Figure 5a</ref>, was retained except for the very small spheres. On the other hand when the stopping function h(•) was set to a constant 1, <ref type="figure">Figure 5b</ref>, the overall diffusion converged to a simple mean curvature motion and the structure was destroyed. Our supplemental material includes animations that show the full evolution of the diffusions as given in <ref type="figure">Figure 5b</ref> (sigma unity.avi), and 5c (sigma 40.avi).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Impact of Derivative Estimation Filters</head><p>To implement Equation (13) we need to compute the principal curvatures which require second order derivatives for the Hessian H in addition to the gradient components. Since we are computing all these quantities from sampled data the quality of the derivative estimation filters plays an important role.</p><p>We used the Taylor Series based framework proposed by Hossain et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref> to construct discrete derivative estimation filters of error order 2-EF and 4-EF 2 . Usually for real data where the polynomial order of the underlying function is not known apriori, a 4-EF filter has been found to yield more accurate results than 2-EF.</p><p>For our experiment, we used an Angiography dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> in which the blood vessel were the focus of the study. We used the same diffusion parameters (σ = 1) and only varied the first and second order derivative filters. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref> demonstrates that the higher order filter (4-EF) preserves more details in the blood vessels while still removing some of the spurious elements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Stability and Convergence</head><p>We performed empirical tests of stability and convergence whose details can be found in Section C of the Appendix. We learned that with ρ = 1 (in voxel units) and all the other parameters kept the same as Section 5.1, including σ = 1, the time stepping of Δt ≤ 0.4 is stable for most practical purposes. The choice of ρ = 1, which is common in many diffusion methods, was made only to have a better smoothing behavior in a relatively homogeneous region under noise, and this has little effect on the stability. This parameter ρ is useful only for the purpose of de-noising and the value of 1 yields best results for most noise types as we will demonstrate in the next section. Therefore for the rest of the paper we keep all the parameters the same as Section 5.1 except ρ = 1 and Δt = 0.40.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DE-NOISING PROPERTIES OF OUR PROPOSED MODEL</head><p>Although our proposed PDE model is a general purpose smoothing technique to evolve a 3D volume over time removing small high frequency details while preserving edges it exhibits de-noising properties too. On the other hand, general purpose de-noising techniques have been formulated previously, e.g. simple bi-lateral filtering, which has been shown to be a variant of gradient magnitude based non-linear diffusion by Barash and Comaniciu <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Because of the drawbacks of the gradient magnitude based models, the equivalent de-noising operators inherit similar problems. Further, anistropic diffusion in 3D based on the KM model is very sensitive to the parameter choice. Therefore, none of these existing techniques would be well suited for de-noising in 3D without facing difficulties.</p><p>In this subsection we will discuss, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the de-noising properties our proposed PDE model has in the context of the four common noise types: additive Gaussian noise, additive Poisson noise, multiplicative Speckle noise and Salt and Pepper noise. We chose the Tooth dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[29]</ref> which is relatively noise-free and diffused it using our proposed method after adding a particular type of noise. For all the experiments we have set the parameters as described in Section 5.5. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 11</ref> summarizes the de-noising properties of our proposed anistropic diffusion model and it shows that our proposed method could de-noise the tooth data quite well in all four cases. Our method works best with Salt and Pepper noise which is of no surprise because Salt and Pepper noise introduces random and very local blob type artifacts in the volume that get removed immediately and remarkably well. For Gaussian noise and Poisson noise, our method performed similarly well on both occasions. Speckle noise turned out to be the hardest to tackle of all, which is not surprising, and yet our method performed well achieving an SNR of over 24.5 dB (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 11</ref>). We also provide animation sequences to show the denoising process for each noise type listed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 11</ref> as supplementary materials: gaussian.avi, poisson.avi, speckle.avi, and salt-pepper.avi.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref> we present a qualitative result of our diffusion model applied to a 3D Ultrasound data of human liver <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[27]</ref> with a size of 247 × 208 × 86, which has been sub-sampled from the original data by a factor of two in each dimension. Ultrasound data are usually <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Performance evaluation of different diffusion methods: our method, SRNRAD and ORNRAD, on different types of naturally occurring noise. The best performing result for each metric is highlighted with a bold number while the second best is underlined. For the Rician noise we used a standard deviation of 20 similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref>. Note that there can be ties. contaminated with speckle noise and it is noteworthy how the noise was lessened keeping all the vital structures intact even for a relatively low resolution volume. Note how the tubular structures, which were barely discernible in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7a</ref>, stick out clearly in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7b</ref>. When we attempted to apply the KM model on this same dataset we faced real challenges to pick a right value for the parameter k as we had no prior knowledge about the gradient magnitude distribution around the tubular structures and this itself speaks in favor of our method where we could pick within a wide range of values for σ and still got some decent and consistent results. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gaussian</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Comparison with other de-noising methods</head><p>In this section we will compare our method with two very recent PDE based de-noising filters, namely Scalar Rician Noise-Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion SRNRAD and Oriented Rician Noise-Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion ORNRAD, proposed by Krissian and Aja-Fernández <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref>. These filters were designed to de-noise specifically Rician noise in 3D MRI data. At a higher SNR, Rician distribution converges to Gaussian distribution. According to Aja-Fernández et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the noise estimator used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref> is based on the variance estimation of additive Gaussian noise. This is, however, not an unfair mismatch because the Rician noise converges to additive Gaussian noise after few iterations. Therefore, we will also apply their filters on additive Gaussian noise. It is worth mentioning that both SRN-RAD and ORNRAD require users to manually specify a sub-volume for the noise estimator. Further, to demonstrate the versatility of our proposed method, we will apply all three methods on other types of noise and show that our method can be applied equally well in most types of naturally occurring noise types using exactly the same set of parameters values.</p><p>For comparison we have chosen the same dataset as <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref>: the simulated structural MR data <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref>, and used the same quantitative metrics -namely Mean Squared Error MSE, Structural Similarity Index SSIM <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[36]</ref>, and Quality Index Based on Local Variance QILV <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> -for the quality assessment. In accordance to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref>, we also discarded the background, where the original noise-free volume is zero, from any assessments. It is noteworthy to mention that we have used the exact same Matlab script to compute these metrics as the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref> and for SRNRAD and ORNRAD we have used their own C/C++ implementations in the AMILab software <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes the performance of the three diffusion techniques and we provide the corresponding images in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 12</ref>. In terms of MSE, our method performed significantly better than both ORNRAD and SRNRAD for all noise types except Speckle and Poisson, where the differences are close for the MSE metric. For the SSIM metric, we find that our method again performed better than both ORNRAD and SRNRAD for all noise types except Speckle where the numerical difference is only in the third decimal place. It is rather intriguing to find that our method tied with ORNRAD and actually performed better than SRNRAD for the SSIM metric in the case of Rician noise, for which those two filters were specifically designed for. Using the QILV metric, our method performed only marginally different from the ORNRAD for all the noise types except Salt and Pepper noise for which case our method clearly outperformed both ORNRAD and SRNRAD by a large margin for all the three metrics. However, we acknowledge that ORNRAD and SRNRAD were designed for Rician noise (and should also work well for Gaussian) but this experiment reveals that our proposed method, unlike many de-noising methods, can be applied generally for all common noise types and still produce decent results if not better in some cases and that too without re-tuning parameters. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 12</ref> corroborates our numerical results although we see the results yielded by ORNRAD and SRNRAD are visually smoother in homogeneous regions. On the other hand we argue that the fine fiber like structures as seen in the bottom left region of the original volume were preserved better by our method.</p><p>Our method was implemented in Matlab where the values of τ ρ , κ 1 , κ 2 and n T Hn in Equation (13) were computed using MEX files (C/C++ extension for Matlab) using only a single thread. Other computations including all first and second derivative estimations and convolutions were performed using Matlab scripts. On the other hand SRNRAD and ORNRAD were implemented as multi-threaded C/C++ codes in AMILab as mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> reports average time (in seconds) each method took per iteration when we ran them on an Intel Core TM 2 Duo (2.4 GHz on each core) based system using the MRI dataset. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows that our method performs ≈ 14.4 times faster than ORNRAD despite our Matlab implementation. On the other hand, though SRNRAD runs faster, a clear winner is not yet obvious as most computations in our method were performed in Matlab. The proposed method is not only superior in run-time performance, but is superior or comparable in both qualitative ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 12</ref>) and quantitative <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref> measures. In addition, we would like to re-emphasize the ease of parameter choice in our method as we achieved all of these performances using exactly the same parameter settings without retuning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">IMPACT ON VISUALIZATION: 2D TRANSFER FUNCTION</head><p>Kindlmann and Durkin <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref> proposed a 2D transfer function which proved to be very powerful at classifying homogeneous regions and boundaries in a 3D volume. In their method a 2D histogram would be generated where the horizontal axis would be the function value and the vertical axis would be the directional first derivative along the gradient f n , a quantity that happens to be just the gradient magnitude, i.e. f v = ∇ f . For a clean 3D scalar data this histogram will have arc like patterns for every unique boundary in the volume. Because of its importance in visualization, we show the utility of our novel diffusion method in the context of this 2D transfer function. The counts in the histograms are compressed with the function log 10 (x + 1) -where x is the actual count -before plotting them as pixels. Darker pixels denote higher count. For brevity, we will omit the axes labels from the 2D histogram images in this section. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref> we present the 2D histogram before and after diffusion for two different noise types while a reference histogram of the original dataset is provided in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9a</ref>. It is remarkable to see how each noise type changes the 2D histogram so dramatically while our diffusion method brings the original pattern back to a recognizable form. A closer inspection of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8b</ref> reveals that our diffusion not only removes the Salt and Pepper noise but also enhances the pattern in the 2D histogram. This indicates that running our diffusion on a clean dataset for the purpose of smoothing will also enhance its 2D histogram. To verify this, we diffused the tooth data without adding any noise and computed the 2D histogram in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref> which shows that the patterns in the histogram are indeed enhanced. This makes sense because our diffusion was modeled in a way such that edges and tubular structures are well preserved while small, high frequency details are smoothed out. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 10</ref> immediately demonstrates an even greater problem with the gradient magnitude based KM model where the patterns in the 2D histogram get virtually destroyed whereas the patterns get enhanced with our method instead. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION</head><p>Often times, the salient features in 3D data are not easily detectable by volume visualization methods, especially those based on simple transfer function designs. Therefore there is often a need to preprocess data in a reliable manner so that the salient features are preserved. Such pre-processing methods are often based on a smoothing or anisotropic diffusion framework, which requires laborious parameter tuning.</p><p>In this paper we have presented a novel anisotropic diffusion model for 3D scalar data to address these issues. We have used an intuitive definition for edges based on the directional second derivative along the gradient. This led us to the design of a PDE with a stopping function that is much less sensitive to its parameter σ and smoothes data while preserving edges. We have shown that with this new stopping function diffusion is performed consistently on an iso-surface regardless of the gradient magnitude, which is in contrast to previous methods, like KM. Even more so, our proposed diffusion model remains second order and much simpler to implement unlike higher order and existing de-noising PDEs.</p><p>On the other hand, our results demonstrate some remarkable denoising properties of the proposed diffusion model. On this end, we have compared our results with a recent PDE based de-noising technique on five different noise types.</p><p>With such consistent edge preserving smoothing and denoising properties our diffusion model has great utility in the context of visualization. We demonstrated the effect of our diffusion model on the quality of the rendered images using a variety of datasets, including both synthetic and real. Further, we showed its impact on multidimensional histograms, which are the basis of many volume rendering algorithms. Specifically, we are able to recover the arc patterns in the histogram even in the presence of strong noise. In the noiseless case, our diffusion has been found to still enhance these histograms without re-tuning a parameter for each new dataset. This will eventually let the practitioner use our diffusion model as a general purpose smoothing and de-noising tool without destroying salient features or tuning a parameter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">FUTURE WORK</head><p>Convergence, stability requirements, and continuity of the underlying function are not well understood in our method from a theoretical standpoint, which will be our next goal. Apart from the theoretical treatments, our method can also be studied more rigorously in the domain of de-noising. In addition, a comparison to non-local means <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6]</ref> has been planned as a future study.</p><p>Another interesting area of research would be to extend our method for point based models and geometric meshes. For example, the classical PM model has been used within a level set framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[32]</ref>, photon mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[30]</ref>, and we speculate similar applications of our method in such areas.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figures (11a, 11b, 11c, 11d</ref>), was derived from an experiment performed with one particular type of noise, as indicated by the corresponding captions. All the diffusions were performed with identical settings and for 25 iterations. Identical transfer functions were used to render all the 3D images above. The profile plot in each figure is a 1-D plot of the scalar values taken from a slice as indicated by the yellow line in the 2D images. The red curve is a plot of the original scalar values, the green curve is that of the noisy scalar values while the black curve is the plot of the de-noised scalar values. Note how the black curve approximates the red curve for different noise types. SNR (in dB) of the noisy and the diffused data are also provided for each experiment. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Manuscript received 31</head><label>31</label><figDesc>March 2010; accepted 1 August 2010; posted online 24 October 2010; mailed on 16 October 2010.
