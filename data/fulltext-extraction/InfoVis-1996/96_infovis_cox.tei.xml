				<p>Many business data visualization applications involve large databases with dozens ofJields and millions of rows. Interactive visualization of these databases is dificult because of the large amount of data involved. We present a method of summarizing large databases which is wellsuited to interactive visualization. We illustrate this with a visualization tool for the domain of call billing data. &apos; 1 Multiway Tables One important use of information visualization in the business community is in the mining of large databases. A relation in one of these databases may have several dozen columns and thousands to millions of rows. An example is call detail, where each row is a telephone call and the columns are fields describing the call. For billing purposes, AT&amp;T provides call detail to its largest customers in the form of CD-ROM databases [I]. Each CD-ROM contains over two million call detail records with about 30 fields each, and it is not uncommon for large corporate customers to receive five to ten CD-ROMs each month. Few information visualization systems can directly manage this volume of data, particularly if the application also calls for interactive visualization (defined here as at least five updates per second). In this case, the only practical solution is to visualize selected summaries of the data. These summaries or roll-ups are obtained by preprocessing the database and storing the results as a new, smaller table. The visualization is then used to inspect the roll-ups. It is also desirable to provide mechanisms whereby the user can &quot;drill-down&apos;&apos; and inspect the rows of the original table corresponding to selected portions of the roll-up. One common form of roll-up is the multiway table, which summarizes the data with respect to chosen keys. The fields selected as keys and the values stored for each key are selected to support the anticipated user tasks. To return to the example of telephone billing data, a useful one-way table is one keyed by the originating number and store the total number, duration, and charge for all calls made by that number. A second table might store the same information for each hour of the day.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dianne Hackborn</head><p>Oregon State University Corvallis, Oregon, 9733 1 hackbod @ cs.orst.edu</p><p>The use of one-way tables limits the utility of the system, as there is no connection between the data in the different tables. To address this problem, we can expand the roll-up to a multiway table. Each dimension of such a table represents one of the selected key fields: each cell represents a particular combination of keys. For example, the combination of the two previous one-way tables yields a two-way table where each "cell" contains the number of calls, total time, and total charge for some combination of originating number and hour. This concept extends to tables of arbitrary dimensions.</p><p>One-way tables can be displayed using any of a variety of familiar mechanisms, such as bar or pie charts <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Multiway tables are somewhat more difficult to visualize directly, although techniques do exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[ 3 ]</ref> . A simpler technique is to present the multiway table using one view for each dimension of the table, and link the views so user actions (e.g., item selections) in one are reflected in the others <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. To retain the power of the multiway table, the information in each view must be computed dynamically in response to the user's actions. In the two-way table example, if the user interacts with the "hour" view to deselect all calls made during business hours, the "originating-number" view should immediately change to show only calls made outside of business hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Interactive Visualization</head><p>Most businesses uses a database server to store and distribute information. The computation of multiway tables can be performed by this server, which may use special algorithms to efficiently generate, manipulate, and store the tables. This approach is characteristic of OLAP (online analytical processing) systems, such as Arbor Software Corporation's EssbaseB <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. These systems provide mechanisms for generating multiway table views of a database, which are then available to standard data display systems such as spreadsheets.</p><p>The client-server approach is usually not fast enough for interactive visualization-the time needed to obtain information from the server exceeds the tight limits required for interaction. The needed performance can be obtained by storing the multiway tables in the client visualization and manipulating them locally in response to user interactions. Thus, the visualization program will make use of some of the same techniques for efficiently storing and manipulating multiway tables as do OLAP database servers. We list a few of the more important ones:</p><p>in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>. (This was a design decision, as the target users of the visualization are comfortable with these views.) The main view is a choropleth map <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Subsidiary controls and views are used to select and deselect on each of the four dimensions of the table. The user can also drill-down and display call detail associated with a particular region. Exploit sparseness. In practice, most of the table entries are zero; use of an associative array dramatically reduces both storage and computation time. Use caching and incremental computation. For example, when the user de-selects an item, only compute the changes to the affected values. Use demand-driven computation. Only compute those values that are needed by active views.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Summary</head><p>Multiway tables can be used by visualization tools to allow the exploration of large-volume data sets in a highly-interactive manner. Storing the multiway table in the tool allows visualizations which are almost as flexible as ones which perform direct queries on the database, but without reauiring the associated database-access over-</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">An Illustrative Implementation</head><p>The SeeBill tool visualizes call detail databases using a multiway table. The current version uses a four-dimensional table, with dimensions direction (inbound or out-  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>bound), endpoint (originating or terminating), region (location of the endpoint, in a hierarchical map), and timeo f d a y (in two-hour periods). Each cell stores the number of calls, total duration, and total charge. The dimensions and the stored values were chosen to support the tasks that business customers have indicated they require in areas such as market analysis, customer support, call-center monitoring, and fraud detection. SeeBill can either load precomputed multiway tables (as from an OLAP server) or compute the tables itself from call detail records. SeeBill uses all the techniques listed above to improve performance. The system is efficient enough to run with good responsiveness (about one update per second) on a 33 MHz 80386 system with eight Mbytes of RAM; interactive response is easily attained on 75 MHz Pentium systems. The SeeBill views are relatively simple, as can be seen L Yhead. The table also facilitates linking of views, as the views all access the same data structure.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>SeeBill interactively displays a four-dimensional multiway table. The hierarchical choropleth map uses color and size to encode values, under the control of the double-thumb sliders to the left. The four buttons below the map allow the user to select any combinations of the direction and endpoint dimensions. Histograms in separate windows are used to display and select on the region and time-ofday dimensions.</figDesc></figure>
