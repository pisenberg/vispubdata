				<p>We present a new multiresolution visualization design which allows a user to control the physical data resolution as well as the logical display resolution of multivariate data. A system prototype is described which uses the Hyperslice representation. The notion of space projection in multivariate data is introduced. This process is coupled with wavelets to form a powerful tool for very large data visualization.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Hyperslice [3] is designed for visualization of multidimensional scalar functions. The main strength of the Hyperslice representation is its interactive environment in which only part of the data is displayed while the rest can be accessedvia direct manipulation. We present an enhanced Hyperslice with a progressive refinement environment for data visualization. This environment allows a user to visualize massive amounts of data at a coarsc resolution to idcntify areas that warrant investigation at finer resolutions. The coarse resolutions provide an accurate visual representation of the finer resolutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Hyperslice</head><p>HypcrSlicc is an extension of the scatterplot matrix which displays multivariate data as a set of bivari- spheres in the Hyperslice representation is depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. We define the lower left tile of the Hyperslice as the origin which has the matrix coordinates of (0,O). So the tile above it has coordinates of (1,0), and the blank one to the right has (0, 1). The cross hair lines shown in the three upper left tiles indicate the locations of the cross-section displays in the diagonal tiles (i.e., { ( n , n) : n E z}).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Dual Multiresolution Exploration</head><p>Two approaches are applied in our design to reduce the size of the data and create a fine to coarse data hierarchyspace projection and wavelet transform. Our system combines these two processes and providcs a dual multiresolution visualization environment to improve the browsing capability as well as the data navigation of the original HyperSlice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Display Resolution Through Space Projection</head><p>Spacc projcctions are based on {R" + @in : m &gt; n}. Our definition of projection i s stronger and more powerful than the similar term which simply describes the view point projections of different dimensions in the scatterplot matrix and prosection matrix [2] techniques. In our design, data from higher rank spaces are projected by different no~ms into dala of lower rank spaces. By applying the projection to the data repeatedly, we generate a data hierarchy with multiple display resolutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Data Resolution Through Wavelets</head><p>Wavelets are based on translation ( W ( t ) + W ( t -1)) and dilalion ( W ( t ) + W ( 2 t ) ) . We use urlhogunal wavelets because they provide non-redundant information. The ideal choice of wavelets is data and application dependent <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>. Without loss of generality, we describe a wavelet as a filter matrix that accepts a data stream with n items, and generates n/2 items of approximations and n f 2 items of details. The approximation is a coarse summary of the original data, and the details contain the data loss during the decomposition. A hierarchy of coarse approximations is generated when this process is applied iteratively to the approximations to obtain increasingly coarse data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Display Resolution versus Data Resolution</head><p>A major diawback of orthogonal wavelets IS thdt thc ieductiuri late is fixed at 50% in each dimension Conventional aggregate func tions, however, can generate more flexible resolutions Data exploration using wavelet approximations count (both objectively and subjectively) on the shapes and the trends of the coarse approximations being preserved For data mining, conventional aggregate functions are more natural and easicr to undcrstand and manipulate We do not change the physical contents of the data during space projections, only the visualization Wavelets, on the other hand, physically replace the data with smoother values are gener-by space projections and wavelets. ated. Wavelet approximations provide a coarse view of a large dataset, which may not otherwise be able to be displayed on scrcen. Oncc thc intcrcsting patterns are located from this resolution of the data, the user can go to a higher data resolution to do the data mining using space projections.</p><p>Nearly all matrix-based visualization representations, including Hyperslice, duplicate mirror images (and/or movements) of the upper left half to the lower right half of the matrix. We, however, believe that this precious space (almost one half of the display area) can be used to provide another dimension of information. In additional to all the standard features to define a Hyperslice representation, our system also provides the error information generated by the wavelet decompositions. The approach of using wavelet details as a mean of data authenticity analysis is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>We present an application using a publicly accessible dataset' containing information about faculty at U.S. universities. We have selected six variates from this datasetthe number of faculty at each faculty rank and the average salaries at each rank. The data is displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> and Color Plate la with 1024 (32') pixel blocks used in each display tile. The display data, which is the second approximation generated from the wavelet transforms, represents well over 36K data values. The points of interest and the ranges of the display of the tiles are indicated in the corresponding diagonal tiles.</p><p>We notice that the overall pixel intensity (see also Color Plate 1 c) of the ( 0 , l), (0, a), and ( 1 , 2 ) tiles generated by the average norm in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> are much lower than the rest of the tiles in the lower right half of the matrix, This indicates that the approximations depicted in the (1,0), (2,0), and ('2,l) tiles (which are the pairwise scatterplots of the salary figures of full, associate, and assistant professors) are more accurate representations than the rest of the approximations in the upper left half of the matrix. Suppose we want to see the distribution of the error in order to show that all (i.e., notjust some of) the error values in the mentioned tiles are small. We decrease the display resolution and apply the maximum norm space projection. As we can see, the pixel intensity of the ( 0 , l), ( 0 , 2 ) , and ( 1 , 2 ) tiles stays almost the same in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> and Color Plate 1 b. This shows that all the error data values of the three tiles are indeed very low.</p><p>' http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/colleges/aaup.data <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: A coarse projection of a coarse approximation.</p></div>
