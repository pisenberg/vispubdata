				<p>This paper describes our work on visualizang the information of a tennis match. W e use competition trees to organize the information of a tennis match and visualize the competition trees by the top-nesting layered maps with translucent colored layers. W e create iconic representations to describe the detailed information of athletic events in an intuitive manner. Specialized views of the information are displayed by applying multiple Magic Lens filters on the top-nesting layered maps. The dynamic nature of the tennis match is depicted by the time-varying display. The approach we present in this paper can be used to visualize other sports information, information with competition property, or information with hierarchical structure.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The graphic capabilities and speed of hardware systems have provided a strong base for exploring new techniques of information visualization in new areas. Sports data has not benefited from information visualization. Large data sets are generated from athletic events day by day. <ref type="bibr">ESPNET [4]</ref> (on the world wide web), radio, television, and newspapers are currently media that report sports events. They usually summarize a contest in top-down prose. They provide the general information (such as the final winner and the final score) at the beginning of their report. After that, they describe the details of some interesting portions, then some sub-portions. They organize the sports information in a tree structure but display it in a linear manner. The match data and reports usually require many pages or screens to be displayed. Examining the sports information to extract the interesting parts or jumping from one item to another item far away is time-consuming and tedious.</p><p>There are commercial tools for displaying tree structures 171 and graphical summaries of football game <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>) and basketball game <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2</ref>).  In this paper, we describe our work on visudizing dynamic, tree-structured data. We demonstrate our approach through visualizing tennis matches. We developed a tool, called TennisViewer, to provide an efficient interface for users to quickly explore tennis match information. Our main contributions are: (1) The top-nesting layer map supports visualizing the overall structure information. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> We represent detailed information in one screen. (3) We apply multiple Magic Lens filters to explore specialized views of the information. (4) We provide a time-varying display to animate all or part of a match. Items 3 and 4</p><p>are straightforward applications of known techniques.</p><p>Item 1 uses a 2D display of translucent layers; its design is similar to Tree-Maps and the visual scheduler PI -</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Competition trees</head><p>The information of a tennis match is hierarchically structured. One match consists of several sets. One set consists of several games. One game consists of several points. One point consists of one or two services. Each service consists of several strokes. Each level may contain different kinds of information. The basic information at the match, set, and game level is:</p><p>(1) who wins and <ref type="formula">2</ref>what the score is. At the point and service level, a single bit of information (who won the service and the point) suffices. At the stroke level, the important information is the ball-trace: where the ball was hit, and where it was returned.</p><p>Tennis matches have an important property: competition. Two players compete with each for each layer of the match hierarchy. It is meaningful to depict this competition property. The hierarchical structure, information, and the competition property form the basic elements of a tennis match to be visualized.</p><p>The hierarchically-structured information can be organized by trees. We can construct the trees from bottom (strokes) to top (the match), level by level. We think of the process of playing a match as a treebuilding process. During the match, each player tries to build his own tree up to the next level. When he completes a stroke, he builds a stroke node. If he completes the last successful stroke, he claims the node that lies one level higher: the service node. All his stroke nodes become the children of the service node. When he wins the service, he claims a node that lies one level higher: the point node. The point node inherits all his service nodes as its children. When he wins the last point, he claims a node that lies one level higher: the game node. The game node inherits all his point nodes as its children. This process continues, level by level, until the end of the match.</p><p>At this time, the winner completes a tree by claiming the match node at the top level. Both players always compete for the next higher available node, but only one of them can claim it.</p><p>We combine the trees built by the two players together to be a competition tree. It depicts the hierarchical structure and the competition property of the tennis matches. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the top three levels of the ideal tree for player one (we use black dots to denote the tree nodes that he builds). He wins every game. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows the top three levels of the tree for a more typical match. We use white dots to denote the tree nodes that player two builds. Player one (black) wins the match but loses one set and some games. A dotted line in the tree indicates that a child was been orphaned and does not belong to the node claimed by the competitor. We use the top-nesting layered maps and translucent colored planes to visuaiize the competition trees. The top-nesting layered map visualizes the hierarchical structure. The translucent colored layers visualize the competition property.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Top-nesting layered maps</head><p>Several techniques have been proposed for browsing complex sets of information. The nee-Map method [6] offers a way to visualize hierarchicallystructured information. It maps the full hierarchy onto a rectangular region in a space-filling manner. It is suited to depicting the structure of the hierarchy and the content of the leaf nodes. The Cone Tree <ref type="bibr">[ll]</ref> is another approach to visualizing hierarchicallystructured information. It presents hierarchical structure in a 3D manner. Not all nodes are visible at the same time. Some nodes at the higher level may be hidden, but become visible by rotating the cone tree. The Perspective Wall method <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref> is an approach to visualize information linearly. It uses hardware support to fold a wide 2D layout into an intuitive 3D visualization that has a center panel for detail and two perspective panels for context.</p><p>The top-nesting layered maps is organized using k-d trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. It depicts the parent node and its child nodes by dividing the top-nesting rectangle associated to the parent node into sub-rectangles associated with the child nodes (figures 5 and 6 ) . Each rectangle has a title bar to show information for the corresponding node. The space divides in a top-down process, from the match node to the stroke nodes. The match node holds the whole display space, the outmost rectangle. We vertically divide the rectangle under the title bar into sub-rectangles for sets. Then, we horizontally divide the rectangle under the title bar of each subrectangle for each game of the set. We continue the process level by level, alternating the dividing direction at each level, to build a top-nesting layered map. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> is the top-nesting layered map of the tree of figure 5.</p><p>cll c12 c13 c14 c21 c22 c31 c32 c33 The title bar of each rectangle provides a place to display information about the node. With an appropriate size for the title bar at each level, we can display a great deal of information compactly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Translucent colored layers</head><p>The top-nesting layered map only shows the hierarchical structure and the short annotations. It does not depict the competition property. That is, it does not show who has won a node at a higher level. We assign Colors to the rectangles to represent the competition. We can use red to represent nodes claimed by one player and green for the other player, for example. When a player builds his nodes in the competition tree, his color is assigned to the Corresponding rectangles. Because the child rectangles are embedded in the parent rectangle, their translucent rectangles will reveal the Color of the parent, and hence provide a more global context for the node. A red node in a red parent cell looks different than in a green parent cell. The former case corresponds to a point that contributed to a winning effort by play one. The latter indicates that the point was paid of a losing effort.  We synthesized data for a tennis match between J. Bond (red color) and M. Michel (green color). <ref type="figure">Figure</ref> 10 is the result of visualizing this tennis match. The match layer, set layer, and game layer of its competition tree are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">figure 8</ref>. This top-nesting layered map depicts the hierarchical structure of this match. The scores of the match, each set, each game, the match title, and the players' names are shown in the corresponding title bars. The competition property is captured by colors. J. Bond wins the match with 3-2. The color of the match rectangle is red. He wins the first, third, and fifth set with 6-3,7-6, and 6-2. The set rectangles of these three sets are shown as red-on-red. M. Michel wins the second and fourth set with 7-5 and 6-3. The set rectangles of these two set are shown as green-on-red. Because J. Bond wins the match, all the information in the display is colored by the global outcome of "winner = red". Because it is difficult to discern color coordinates in color space, the gamut between player 1 and player 2 is not likely to be extensible to multi-team games or larger-dimensional color subspaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Iconic represent at ion</head><p>In a tennis match, the ball traces of strokes are an important information to the coaches, the players, and the fans. Using a text description (Bond's service to the left court was returned out of bounds) is a laborious way to communicate the spatial information that describes the flight of a ball from one court to another.</p><p>The ball traces are better depicted in pictures. We use an iconic representation at the stroke level to depict each ball trace. Each icon contains a tennis court; the red and the green colors represent the sides belong to the players, and the arrow shows the ball trace.</p><p>We place the icons in the middle of the Ten-nisViewer stroke rectangles. The icons are resizable dong with the display space allocated to the stoke rectangles. If the icon is too small or not shown, the user can use the Magic Lens filters (discussed in the next section) to view them. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 9</ref> shows the iconic representatioln of the ball traces of a service. The ball is served from the bottom side to the top side. Then, it is returned from top side to the bottom side, but lands out of bounds. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Magic Lens</head><p>To reveal the information at the low liayers of the hierarchy, we must magnify the image. A fisheye view </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Time-varying display</head><p>The information of a tennis match is dynamic. At the beginning of the match, two players have no points and the competition tree is empty. As the match progresses, the players vie for points, games, and sets. They build their own trees from bottom to top. At the end of the match, one player wins the match and his competition tree grows to the match layer. Because some strokes, services, points, and games are more important than others, the display should reflect their importance as it dynamically updates to show information from a match in progress.</p><p>TennisViewer provides a time-varying display to support such animation. The user can select any part at any level to be animated. After the user selects the animated parts, our time-varying display rebuilds the part of the competition tree which is related to this animated part of the match, draws the corresponding top-nesting rectangles, and colors these rectangles stroke by stroke from bottom to top, according to We adopted the Magic Lenses in our system to support exploring information at the low layers. The Magic Lens is a natural choice in a window system that supports rectangular viewports. Moreover, Magic Lenses can easily be overlaid atop each other to produce deep zooming. The basic function of our Magic Lens filters is to zoom into the low layers. Through the rebuilt tree. When a player completes a stroke, the rectangle of this stroke is colored in the player's color. When the player wins a service, the rectangle of this service is colored in the player's color and is covered under the points of this service with translucent. When the player wins a point, this point's rectangle is colored in the player's color which re-colors the translucent display atop it. The time-varying display shows when important events occur through color changes: winning a set causes the colors to adjust in the set-rectangle. Winning a match causes adjustments everywhere in the display. The time-varying display also updates the title bars to be consistent with the information visualization. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> shows the effect when the red player wins the final point of the game of figure 11. Note that there are two basic ways to construct rectangles in the display. One way is to fix the size of child nodes and let their parents be sized accordingly. The other way is to fix the size of the parents and adjust the size of the children to fit. The advantage of the first approach is that the display can be constructed on-the-fly and bottom-up as a match </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Exploring information</head><p>The tennis match information in figure 10 includes 1 match, 5 sets, 51 games, 332 points, 446 services, and over 2800 strokes. This is the first time that we have seen this much information displayed to visualize a competition tree. The user can quickly locate the interesting sets, games, points, services, and strokes in this top-nesting layered map. He can determine the winners of each node by identifying red and green colors. He can locate the long rallies based on the density of the sub-rectangles. If he is interested in examing double faults, he can view the match through a Magic Lens that only displays double faults. The user can apply Magic Lens filters to enlarge the interesting parts to get a clearer view and use time-varying display to re-play the whole or part of the match. He can see each ball trace and see the score change.</p><p>We envision the use of video at the lowest levels of the map to allow an actual replay of specific portions of the match. Future work includes installing statistical lenses (like spreadsheets) to operate on the data of the match. TennisViewer could also be modified to show stroke details (top-spin, under-spin, volley, etc.) that could be helpful to coaches and interesting to fans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Conclusion</head><p>The TennisViewer system provides coaches, players, and fans a new manner to analyze, review, and browse a tennis match. It captures a large amount of information in one screen. The user can quickly explore the information. We select tennis because it is a popular sport, because there is so much information in a tennis match, and because it is organized in an obvious tree-structure. The tree structure maps to points, games, sets, and the (root-level) match. We modified Tree-Maps to show node-ownership in a 2D display. Translucent coloring of the nodes provides a multi-resolution view of which player won the varies nodes. Animation shows abrupt color changes after crucial points.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The summary of a football game.</figDesc></figure>
