				<p>As the use of 30 information presentation becomes more prevalent the need for effective viewing tools grows accordingly. Much work has been done in developing tools for 2 0 spaces which allow for detail in context views. We examine the extension of such 2 0 methods to 30 and explore the limitations encountered in accessing internal regions of the data with these methods. We then describe a novel solution to this problem of intemal access with the introduction of a distortion function which creates a clear line of sight to the focus revealing sections previously obscured. The distortion is symmetric about the line of sight and is smoothly integrated back into the original 3 0 layout.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">I~t r o d u~t~o n</head><p>There is accumulating evidence [ 1,211 supporting the idea that 3D representations of data are advantageous both intuitively and quantitatively. As this translates into frequent use of 3D information spaces the need for effective 3D viewing tools becomes increasingly important. There has been a considerable amount of work recently in developing such tools for 2D information displays. Much of this has focused on the need to display sufficient detail within its global context; for surveys see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[ 15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">181</ref>. This has led to the notion of multi-scale diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[8]</ref> or distortion viewing where different sections of the information are displayed at different scales. These differing scales of magnified detail and compressed context can be integrated through various distortion functions <ref type="bibr">[2, 3, 9, 10, 16, 191.</ref> Support for the concept of integrated detail in context viewing can be found in studies by Furnas <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[7]</ref>. This work indicates that across many disparate fields humans store and recall information in great detail for areas of interest and gradually decreasing detail for the related context. The studies in experimental psychology [6, 121 indicate that while humans integrate information that is perceived as a single event auto-matically, cognitive re-integration of distinct events such as multiple views requires much greater effort.</p><p>Semnet <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> discusses two 3D fisheye approaches, other than the implicit one provided by perspective. One, relying on the use of semantics for positioning, creates an octree and uses this to display focal region in full detail and more remote sections in progressively larger volumes. This approach isefficient but suffers from sudden changes between boundaries of regions of differing scales. The other, a density approach, samples fully around the focus and less as the distance increases. This approach would actually aggravate density problems in the focal region. Mitra [ 141 method of threshold filtering exploded views while not actually moving occluding objects does create more space in the 3D view allowing improved if not total visual access for internal sections.</p><p>This work explores the extension of 2D distortion viewing techniques, providing framework and motivation for the development of visual access distortion techniques for 3D data. Inherent in working with data in 3D is the fact that some data will be buried within a structure, whether a solid model or a complicated 3D graph layout, and hence visually inaccessible. Previous work provides access to the internal details of such structures through the use of cuttingplanes, layer removal and transparency. We describe a novel solution to this problem of internal access with the introduction of a distortion function which creates a clear line of sight to a focus revealing sections that had been previously obscured. The distortionis symmetric about the line of sight and is smoothly integrated back into the original 3D layout. This paper is organized as follows: first we will demonstrate the problems that arise with a naive translation of 2D techniques to a 3D display. Then extend Leung and Apperly [ 111 observations about the mathematical distinction between displacement and magnification functions with a practical application of these aspects separately creating our viewer aligned visual access distortion <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> to provide an exploration tool for 3D information displays.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Identifying issues in 3D distortion vi e w i n g</head><p>This section illustrates the problems that arise when applying 2D distortion techniques to 3D displays. The intention is to demonstrate the distinctive patterns of differing types of distortion, and show that while they offer considerable advantage in a 2D display, they do little to improve access in 3D. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the characteristic patterns of four 2D distortion methods. While this set of example techniques is not exhaustive, it is representative of the types of distortion available. The space-filling orthogonal approach (top left), similar to stretch tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[17]</ref> and 2D-bifocal <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[18]</ref>, is formed by stretching all data that lies on either of the two axis centered at the focus and compressing the remaining areas uniformly. The resulting distorted image makes good use of available screen space but has entire rows and columns of distorted data. The simple orthogonal approach (top right), used by [2, 201, performs the same distortion but leaves the data in the rows and columns aligned with the focus "retched. This basic approach creates less data distortion but leaves more unused space. The graduated orthogonal approach (bottom left) magnifies data according to its orthogonal distance from the focus. A variety of mathematical curves have been used with this approach including arctan <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">13]</ref>, hemisphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[16]</ref>, and hyperbola [lo]. The particular pattern of this figure is based on the sine curve. The fourth example (bottom right) uses a Gaussian curve to radially distribute distortion. Again other curves are possible, in fact many techniques include both radial and orthogonal options. The principle of nonlinear radial distortion is common to [3, 10, 171.</p><p>These four distortion patterns reveal the different possibilities offered in providing a magnified focus in a 2D context. <ref type="figure">Figures 2, 3, 4</ref> and 5 show a direct naive extrapolation of the previously discussed two-dimensional schemes to 3D data. Simply applying these approaches to a 3D display does more to obscure the focal point than reveal it. In fact, the usual problem of some objects occluding others in 3D layouts has been exacerbated in 2D distortion approaches with space-filling aspects. While the orthogonal step function ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>) does open up some visual access to the focal node, it still does not allow viewing from all angles. If distortion is to aid in full examination of internal aspects of 3D data, one necessary function is that the user actually have unrestricted visual access to the chosen focus.  Leung and Apperly [ 1 I] discuss distortion viewing in terms of a transformation or displacement function with a derivative magnification function. As the 2D examples reveal, displacement provides the space that allows for the magnification. The usual application creating 2D detail within context views is achieved by applying both magnification and displacement distortions simultaneously. However, this does not have to be the case; these ideas are distinct and can be applied alone or in conjunction. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 6</ref> shows at the top an undistorted one-dimensional array of cubes, second from the top is the same array with a central focus magnified only (no nodes are displaced), third the distortionis applied to displace nodes to either side of the focus (no magnification), and the last example makes use of both magnification and distortion Notice that without the magnification both orthogonal techniques have the same appearance <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 7)</ref>. This offers little improvement with the graduated and radial techniques <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figures 8 and 9</ref>). However, while the orthogonal approaches seem an inefficient use of space in two dimensions, in three dimensions the separation provides partial visual access. However, this partial solution is not very satisfying and creates artificial groupings which can still occlude the focus during rotation. The effects of applying only displacement distortion with the four 2D approaches we have been examining can be seen</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Visual Access Distortion</head><p>We believe that for effective three-dimensional detail in context viewing it is important to: e Magnify a chosen focus to display detail. e View the focus as a 3D object with the usual advantage of e Clear a visual path to the focus.</p><p>We have extended the traditional magnification and displacement distortion viewing to include a visual access distortion <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. This is applied radially along the line of sight to displace data items in gradually decreasing amounts as the distance from the line of sight increases. This creates an opening directly in front of the view point, giving visual access to the focus while minimally affecting the rest of the data.    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> shows progressive applications of the visual access distortion.</p><p>The shortest distance from a object 0 to the line of sight is the measure that will be used to determine the distortion at 0. A vector v' from the nearest point P on the line of sight to 0 will define the direction of the distortion at 0 and the length of this vector will be used to determine the magnitude of the distortion. To achieve our goal of smooth integration back into the original data topology we use a Gaussian distribution to determine the magnitude of the displacement. For a given value of d = [Cl, we can determine the height ( h ) of the Gaussian. The shape of the Gaussian function, and hence the distribution of the distortion can be controlled simply by adjusting the height and standard deviation of the curve. Since our viewing direction is along the line of sight the distortions will appear to the viewer as radially symmetrical about the focus. The result is a distortionof the original data that provides a clear visual path from the viewer to the focal node. The visibility of the focus will be maintained under rotation of the data or motion of the viewpoint, smoothly deflecting nodes away from the line of sight as they approach it and returning them smoothly to their original positions as they move away ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14)</ref>.</p><p>The creation of a clear visual path can now be combined with one of the magnification distortions described earlier to permit an unobstructed view of the focus. Currently, one has choice between the four discussed functions (orthogonal, step, sine and Gaussian) for each of the the three types of distortion (access, displacement and magnification).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Combining visual access, magnification and displacement</head><p>Our visual access distortion [4] can be applied by itself or in combination with either or both magnification and displacement distortions. By itself it allows in context browsing of a 3D display. With magnification it provides detail in context viewing. With the inclusion of displacement greater degrees of magnification can be achieved.</p><p>Applying a visual access distortion to any of the four examined 2D approaches (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 6</ref>) successfully exposes the focus in context. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 15, 16, 17 and 18</ref>, show 2D magnification applied to 3D on the left, and the result of applying the visual access distortion on the right.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref> the space filling approach (left) has completely occluded the central focus node. In applying the visual access distortion we see that it clears a line of sight to  In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16</ref> the simple orthogonal approach (left) magnification of the central node leaves it highly obscured by its neighbors. The application of the visual access distortion (right) can be even more extreme as the inter-node spacing of the surrounding nodes is greater. It is possible to displace them further before they intersect. This combination of the simple orthogonal stretch or step function which magnifies focus only and the visual access distortion is particularly effective.  A focal point can be either data objects or locations in space. When the focal point is an object, the visual access distortion is applied from the viewpoint to the object's center. Browsing involves sequential selection of objects or nodes. Alternatively using a location in space sets the end point of the line of sight that is cleared. The user can interactively control this line-segment-of-sight creating a dynamic probe, fluidly movable through the space. In browsing a 3D display the user can select focal type, position as well as which distortion method to use for displacement, magnification and access. During visual exploration each item is shifted out of the line of sight and then back into their original position.  This motion provides very effective visual feedback about the context and relative positions of the individualdata items.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Arbitrary graphs</head><p>While simple grid graphs have been chosen to clearly reveal the distinctions between distortion techniques, the effectiveness of this approach is not limited to this type of display. The next series shows a polar graph layout that randomizes the radius and angles. <ref type="figure">Figure 20</ref> is the undistorted graph. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 21</ref> shows one focal point, slightly magnified. <ref type="figure">Figure 22</ref> shows increased magnification of the focal point but with the visual access distortion applied to nodes only. This leaves edges cutting across the focal node. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Figure 23</ref> the visual access distortion has also been applied along the length of the edges, curving them away from the line of sight. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 24</ref> shows a graph layout that randomizes position in x, y and z. Even though this graph's degree is limited to four, the random layout has a large number of edges that crisscross the screen, creating their own type of visual density. <ref type="figure">Figure 25</ref> shows one focal point revealed. The magnification and displacement distortions use the simple orthogonal or step function and Gaussian access distortion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>This paper has examined the issues that arise in applying established methods for improving visual access of 2D data to 3D. Simple 2D distortion algorithms for detail and context views have been shown to be readily extensible to manipulate 3D data. These approaches in themselves are insufficient to derive much benefit in 3D as the recurring problem of interior, or hidden, data becoming inaccessible nullifies any advantages of this straightforward approach.</p><p>Visual access distortion provides a clear line of sight to the internal structures of 3D data sets meeting the stated goals of smooth integration, using view rather than data alignment, and providing control over the degree and extent of the distortion. This method of displacing the data preserves context and presents an appealing, understandable result. The viewer aligned access distortion may be applied in conjunction with another space allocation algorithm to further improve the visibility of the focus.</p><p>Future plans for this concept include the application of the ideas presented here to both general 3D graph structures and to solid 3D data. An examination of the potential use of perceptual cues (3D grids, color and shading, stereo display) to reveal the nature of the distortions when applied to more general data sets, is another area of investigation we intend to pursue.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>A group of 2D distortion methods, from topleft to bottom-right: space-filling orthogonal, simple orthogonal or step, graduated orthogonal, and radial Gaussian distortion</figDesc></figure>

For each point in the volume the distortion is now a function of each line of sight. The contributions from each focus are combined [3]. The displacement of any point P relative to a set of n line segments Li, where each segment La begins at an object of interest Oi and terminates at the viewpoint V , may be summarized as follows: nwhere Ni is the point on the ith line segment nearest the point P and g ( ) is the function that returns the height of a Gaussian given the distance from the point P to the line Li . The resulting displacement is the average of several independent distortions, each in a radial direction away from the line segment Li. Thus it is possible to clear lines of sight to several objects simultaneously. InFigure 19a simple average of the two at each point produces clear lines of sight to the two foci.The upper left is one layer deep into the 9 x 9~9 cube. The lower right is 8 layers deep, but still visible.y11 Undistorted random polar graph layout Random graph revealing focal node (from back of graph) with visual access distortion</figDesc></figure>
