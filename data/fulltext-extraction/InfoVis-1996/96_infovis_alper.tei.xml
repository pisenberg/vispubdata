				<p>This paper presents the query and visualization interfaces of the Master Environmental Library (MEL) system. MEL uses the World Wide Web (WWW) to make accessible distributed data whose metadata conform to the Federal Geographic Data Committee&apos;s (FGDC) content standards for digital geospatial metadata. The inte$aces are implemented as J a v P applets and are more intuitive, interactive and possess greater functionality than their Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) counterparts. As well as que ying, the interface allows users to visualize and manage the list of query results so that users can more quickly discover the datasets of real interest. Several new tools used to visualize attributes of the metadata are presented. * This work is fimded by the Defense Simulationand Modeling Office (DMSO) under programelement 0603832D.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The World Wide Web (WWW) [l] has seen explosive growth over the last couple of years. The introduction of easy to use and powerful graphical browsers has made enormous amounts of information readily available. This has, in turn, made producers of data eager to publish them on the WWW to reach a wider audience. Searching for and discovering relevant data from this vast pool is thus becoming increasingly difficult.</p><p>In the field of geographic data, cataloguing repositories of datasets so that users can browse, evaluate and order them has become extremely important. The US government has made it mandatory for federal agencies to publish their geospatial datasets in a form that conforms to the Federal Geographic Data Committee's (FGDC) digital, geospatial metadata standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The goal is to facilitate the exchange of geospatial data between organizationsand systems.</p><p>The Master Environmental Library (MEL) [3] is a working prototype that allows users to search for, browse and retrieve datasets with metadata that conform to the FGDC standard from distributed databases through a central location on the WWW. The initial implementation of the interfaces for the query, presentation of results and the ordering of datasets uses the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) which lacks the interactive, dynamic qualities that users have come to expect from standalone graphical applications. Since it is merely a markup language, interactive applications using HTML require Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts to generate new pages on the server side and transfer them back to the client.</p><p>Sun Microsystems has recently introduced an object-oriented, interpreted language called Javam that has been designed for network computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Although it is a general purpose language, its greatest attraction so far has been the ability of WWW browsers to download and execute small programs called applets written in Javam. The result is that Web pages need no longer be static but can come alive through animations and user interaction. This paper discusses the new query and query results visualization interfaces of MEL implementedas Javam applets. The new interfaces are much more interactive, intuitive, efficient and possess greater functionality than their HTML counterparts. The visualization interface, in particular, allows interactive information visualization to compare query results, thus expeditingthe discovery of data of relevance and interest from a potentially large list. Most WWW based data query interfaces merely prescnt the results as a list of hits and lack this important comparative capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6]</ref>. With the new interface, users are also able to refine their query without initiating a new search.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we discuss the architecture of the MEL system. Section 3 presents the query interface and section 4 discusses the visualization of query results. In section 5 we point to future work and conclude.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Master EnvironmentalLibrary</head><p>The Master Environmental Library (MEL) is an Internet based data discovery and retrieval system that provides access to geographically distributed oceanographic, meteorological, terrain and near space databases. MEL is sponsored by thc Defcnse Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) and its goal is to provide realtime, scenario, historical and climatological datasets for such purposes as simulations, mission planning and scene modeling. MEL has three main components: a user, an access site with which the user interacts, and geographically distributed regional sites where the datasets reside <ref type="figure">(Figure 1)</ref>.</p><p>At a high level, MEL is based on the library paradigm. The access site can be thought of as a "card catalogue" which the user searches. The "cards" are metadata records that comply with the FGDC content standard for digital geospatial metadata. The regional sites which hold the metadata records and the actual datasets can be thought of as library shelves holding the books.</p><p>Using a WWW browser, users interactively create a query made up of the region of interest, time range, keywords and data sources. Query results are presented to the user who can then examine the full text of the metadata record andor generate an order form customized for the selected dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">The Architecture</head><p>The system design is based on a three tier architecture that allows scalability, load management and replacement of functional parts as appropriate technologies advance and mature. The first tier consists of a user, a WWW browser and an optional delivery site. The access site query, results and order interfaces, along with the regional site's order parser, access controller and job scheduler, make up the middle tier. The third tier is made up of the regional site databases and extraction and delivery mechanisms.</p><p>Unlike a two tier clienthemer architecture which can bog down as the number of clients increases, the middle ticr in this architecture is able to balance the load by sending requests to different servers. This tier can physically be made up of multiple computers, one for the access site and one for each of the regional sites. Similarly, the third tier can be made up of one or more computers per rcgional site. A regional site may combine the database and Regional Site Software (RSS) front end on a single computer but would then lose the ability to balance the load.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">The Access Site</head><p>The access site consists of a Hypertext Transfer Protocol Daemon (HTTPD) server, the HTML/JavaTM pagcs and supporting CGI scripts and programs (Figurc 1). Users conncct to the access site and not directly to regional sites which may reside behind a frewall. In the HTML interface, the user fills in a query form to specify the various components of the query. When the query is submitted, a CGI script initiates a parallel Wide Area Information Server (WAIS) query results are presented to the user as a list of titles with hyperlinks to a CGI script. If the user follows the hyperlink, the metadata file is retrieved from the regional site, formatted into an HTML page and presented to the user. From this document, the user can move on to generate an order form by triggering another script that parses the MEL specific content of the metadata file. The order form is customized to present to the user subsettable parameters as specified in the metadata file. The user can then proceed to specify how to subset the dataset, choose the type of delivery desired and then submit the order. The dataset can be delivered via FTP, e-mail, put on tape and mailed or it can be picked up by anonymous FTP at the regional site. Soon, functionality for realtime HTTP ordering and delivery will be added for regional sites that are not behind a firewall and for datasets that are not too large.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">The Regional Site</head><p>The regional site consists of a WAIS server, a database, RSS software and optionally an HTTPD server. The metadata files describing the datasets in the database are indexed and made available for WAIS queries. It is the responsibility of the regional site to keep up-to-date and accurate metadata records that reflect its available datasets.</p><p>Orders for datasets are transmitted to the regional site via electronic mail and processed by the RSS which is a collection of customizable tools that perform many functions such as order parsing, access control, request scheduling, data extraction, formatting, compression, encryption, delivery and notification.</p><p>The MEL syntax in the electronicmail is a Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) compliant syntax. It is possible for a user knowledgeable in the MEL syntax to manually send orders via e-mail without going through the WWW interface. Subscriptions to datasets that are updated periodically are also possible.</p><p>The architecture does not impose procedures on the regional site: the only requirement is that the holdings of the regional site need to be referenced by FGDC compliant metadata files. In particular, regional sites can set their own access control and data delivery procedures and use whatever type of database they choose. The RSS software handles the extraction of the data from the database and the packaging into standard formats.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Querying Metadata Records</head><p>In this section, we discuss the query stage of the MEL JavaTM query interface. Three of the attributes that can be queried are based on a mandatory section of the FGDC standard called Identification Information. These are the bounding coordinates, the time range, and the keywords. A fourth attribute limits the search to particular regional sites. Users set the values of these searchable attributes and the query is submitted as their logical conjunction.</p><p>A consideration during the design of the interface was that the screen real estate is at a premium. For this reason, it was designed to occupy a single area containing mode selection buttons to switch between query attributes and action buttons to submit the query, reset attributes to default values and provide context sensitive help ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). The mode selection buttons at the bottom of the panel change the attribute to be edited by updating the contents of the main display area. This way, users do not have to scroll to different sections of the page when formulating their query. The addition of new query attributes is also facilitated by this layout. The background color of the mode selection buttons is highlighted when the user has changed the values from the defaults to give the user feedback on what has already been specified. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Spatial Coverage</head><p>One of the subsections of the Identification Information section in the FGDC standard is Spatial Domain which specifies the bounding coordinates of the data. In the HTML interface, the user enters these quantities in input fields in a form. The interactive qualities of JavaTM allow the user to define a region of interest by rubberbanding a rectangle with the mouse instead. The bounding region values are updated and displayed in input fields which can also be edited directly. However, in this case, we can also do bounds checking to disallow illegal entries. The user is able to pick the bounded region as a whole and move it around to a different location. This interactive approach is intuitive and much faster for defining approximate regions. It is an interaction paradigm that users have come to expect from standalone applications.</p><p>The defined region can be used for zooming. In this case, a CGI script accesses an environmental database to produce a new image. Zooming results in a map of higher resolution or a panned image. The user can also zoom out or go back to the global view. Pre-defined regions are provided as choice items for quick, precise specifications. The user can choose how the specified region is to be queried against the metadatarecords. The region of interest can be used to return records whose spatial extents are entirely within it, those that intersect it or those that completely cover it. Any combinationof these is also possible. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Temporal Range</head><p>The Time Period of Content subsection of the FGDC metadata standard can be used to specifL the date range an environmental dataset covers. We use a range slider to allow either end of the range to be changed visually <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3)</ref>. Users can affect changes in both ends simultaneously by picking the center of the range slider. Again, input fields are provided for the beginning date and the ending dates to be set textually. he-defined choices are available for quick specification for date ranges such as the current week and year to date. The range slider is a quicker and more intuitive way to set a temporal range than keyboard entries. It is a 1D analog of the 2D region of interest rectangle discussed in the previous section and also provides visual feedback on the context of the temporal range of interest within a global range.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Keywords</head><p>Another subsection can be used to limit the search to keywords that signify the meaning or main ideas of a data set. The FGDC standard allows four types of keywords:</p><p>Theme: the subject OS the data set, e.g. meteorology, oceanography.  Each of these categories cart have multiple thesauri that contain many keywords. This section of the interface provides a text area for the user to enter keywords. There are also three list widgets which the user can use to explore the keyword space. When a new category is selected from the categories list, its thesauri appear in the thesauri list. A new thesaurus selection from this list will update the keywords list accordingly. Keywords pickced from this list are transferred to the text area.</p><p>This hierarchical organization allows users to quickly navigate to keywords that are related. The keyword thesauri are managed at a central site and are downloadecl to the applet as needed. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Regional Sites</head><p>When a query is submitted, ithe access site performs a parallel WAIS search of the MEL regional sites and potentially other FGDC compliant sites. The search can be limited to specific sites. For this purpose, a clickable map is provided which depicts the geographic locations of the sites <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 4)</ref>. Users can include or exclude sites by clicking on their locations in the map or using a list widget.</p><p>Once users have set the values of the searchable attributes, they can submit the query. In the next section, we discuss the visualizationof query results. on the list ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). The titles of the metadata records appear in this list area and each is assigned a unique color for visual identification. Users can select items from this list and only those that are selected are <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. The command area for the visualization interface</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Query Results Visualization</head><p>The WAIS search returns a list of references to metadata records that satisfy the query. The HTML interface displays the list and provides hyperlinks to the actual metadata files. Users can then examine these files to decide which ones to order. If a search results in a large number of hits, this is a very inefficient and time consuming way of narrowing down the datasets of interest.</p><p>In the new interface, extra attributes of the metadata are returned from the query and visualized. The HTML page containing the applet is created dynamically from a CGI script and the attribute values to be visualized are passed as parameters to the applet. Users can then compare metadata records visually based on these attributes. Records that are not particularly interesting can be eliminated quickly without the need to look at the metadata files. Further, the list can be filtered by refining the query without doing a new search.</p><p>The query visualization applet contains two main areas: a command area that is fixed and a visualization area that changes depending on what visualizationtool is being used. The visualization area can be tom off and displayed in a separate window outside the browser. At the top of the command area is the list of query results and the buttons that perform operations included in the visualizations.</p><p>A second list area is used to display items that are of interest. Only one item from this list can be selected at a time for operations such as viewing the associated metadata file and generating an order form. Metadata records can be transferred to this list either from the query results list by double clicking, or through the visualization tools.</p><p>Mode selection buttons determine which particular visualization tool is in use. Currently, there are three attributes of the metadata records that are passed on for visualization purposes. These are the spatial and temporal ranges and the number and types of browse graphics that are associated with the datasets. Soon, others will be added such as model resolution, data domain, data sources, etc. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Spatial Coverages Visualization</head><p>The spatial coverages visualization tool draws the bounding regions on a map as colored rectangles that match the unique color of the associated list item <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 6)</ref>. The map is a subclassed version of the spatial coverage query tool described in section 3.1. Thus, zooming functionality is available to the user. This is very useful since the user can zoom in to a region where there are many metadata records to better differentiate between them. The tool allows users to , visually compare the results and determine how they relate to the query.</p><p>Users can point to a colored rectangle with the mouse to display the title of the record as well as the actual bounding region quantities in a status bar. This brushing capability is important in retrieving precise numerical and textual information about the visualized item and is included in all the visualization tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Clicking on a rectangle transfers the item(s) to the interesting items list for subsequent examination.</p><p>Although users can manipulate the query results list to choose which items to visualize, it is also useful for users to be able to select items based on their intersection with a certain region. For this purpose, buttons are provided that either select items that are entirely within the region of interest, are intersected by it or cover the region of interest completely. This query based filtering of items is another key component that is used in all the visualizationtools. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Temporal Ranges Visualization</head><p>Another quantity that is fetched for visualization is the temporal ranges of the datasets. For this purpose, the range is represented as colored horizontal line segments the lengths of which are scaled to reflect the range value <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Figure 7)</ref>. Users can also define a window by manipulating two vertical lines and then zoom in to this region. The purpose of this is to better differentiate between items, especially the tick marks on the line segments that represent the frequency of numerical model runs for environmental prediction data. The tick marks are displayed only when there is enough resolution to differentiate adjacent ones. Quantitative information is displayed on a line segment when the user points to it. Subsetting operations similar to the spatial coverage visualization tool are available. With this tool, users are able to quickly see the temporal extents of the datasets in relation to each other and in relation to the temporal component of the query that produced the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Browse Graphics Visualization</head><p>Browse graphics are entries in the metadata record that provide hyperlinks to products such as images and movies about the data. There can be multiple entries for each metadata file. The purpose of this tool is to visually present the user with a summary of which metadata records contain how many and what kind of browse graphics. Each type of browse graphic known to the system has an icon representing it. Another icon represents a graphic that is unknown to the system. The visualization tool displays the browse graphics icons of a metadata record in a horizontal bar <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure  8)</ref>. A colored rectangle at the beginning identifies the item. Pointing to this rectangle displays the item's title, clicking on it transfers the item to the list of interesting items. Pointing to an icon, on the other hand, displays the URL of the browse graphic.</p><p>-- Clicking on the icon follows this URL as a hyperlink. Filtering operations can also be performed based on the types of browse graphics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Combined Attributes Visualization</head><p>The three visualization tools discussed above compare the selected metadata records based on a single attribute. It is also desirable to have a global view of the selected items and compare them based on multiple quantities. That is the purpose of the combined attributes visualization tool.</p><p>Users can choose to compare the items based on all three attributes (spatial and temporal ranges and the browse graphics) or a subset of these. For each attribute, a rectangle represents the range of values of the attribute for all the items and is filled proportional to the value of the attribute for that item <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Figure 9</ref>). For example, an unfilled rectangle represents an attribute value that is close to the minimum value, while a completely filled rectangle has approximately the maximum value of the items. This tool shows how items compare with regard to all the visualized attributes. A user, for instance, can spot an item that has high spatial coverage and temporal ranges but has very few browse graphics.</p><p>The quantity used to represent the spatial coverage attribute is the area of the bounding region in degrees squared. For the temporal range, the quantity is the number of days and for the browse graphics, it is the number of browse graphics. In this tool as well, brushing allows the actual quantities to be displayed as well as the minimum and maximum values. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>This paper has presented the query and visualization interfaces of the MEL distributed database access system. The use of JavaTM applets for these interfaces has proved very useful and powerful. A compact, intuitive and interactive query interface was achieved that is a vast improvement over the HTML interface. The greater benefit was realized in the visualization interface where a user can dynamically and interactively visualize metadata records that result from a query. The interactive manipulation and examination of metadata records allow users to quickly navigate to the records of interest.</p><p>The FGDC has chosen the Java query and query results applets described here as the basis for the public interface to the National Geospatial Data <ref type="bibr">Clearinghouse [9]</ref>. We are currently working on revisions to the interface to satisfy the diverse needs of the geospatial data community.</p><p>For future work, other quantitativeattributes will be fetched with the query and tools will be added to visualize them. For instance, for prediction model data, the grid resolution is a candidate. Another candidate is the source of the dataset. Textual attributes can also be retrieved and visualized with novel informationvisualizationtechniques [IO, 1 I].</p><p>An idea that we will be pursuing is user profiles. The MEL system already has user profiles that keep identification information such as e-mail and FTP addresses, PGP keys and passwords of users so that the dataset ordering process is faster. We would like to provide users the ability to save queries and retrieve them at later sessions as starting points for other queries.</p><p>We are currently designing an applet for the data ordering stage of MEL. In this stage, an order form is generated that is tailored to the metadata record. Users are sure to benefit from the interactive qualities of a JavaTM applet at this stage as well.</p><p>The current implementation is a prototype. We plan to make improvements on the interface based on user feedback once the system is field tested. A consideration in this endeavor is that additional functionality comes at the expense of longer download times so mere bells and whistles should be avoided.</p><p>How the system scales to hundreds of results needs to be evaluated. In these cases, there will be visual clutter in the visualizations but the ability to subset allows users to reduce the results set and thus the clutter.</p><p>The interest shown in JavaTM by the WWW community is justified. As well as attractive little animations that liven up WWW pages, JavaTM permits users to interact with them in the same way that they are used to in standalone applications. With the greater acceptance of this and similar technologies which allow secure, executable content on the client side, such interfaces will be indispensable.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>[ 7 ]Figure 1 .</head><label>71</label><figDesc>search of the specifiedregional sites.
