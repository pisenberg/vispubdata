			<abstract>
				<p>A glyph-based method for visualizing the nematic liquid crystal alignment tensor is introduced. Unlike previous approaches, the glyph is based upon physically-linked metrics, not offsets of the eigenvalues. These metrics, combined with a set of superellipsoid shapes, communicate both the strength of the crystal&apos;s uniaxial alignment and the amount of biaxiality. With small modifications, our approach can visualize any real symmetric traceless tensor.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Tensor visualization aims to depict the inherently spatial information contained within a tensor. Like scalar and vector visualization, this depiction is performed using interactive, computer-generated graphics. However, unlike those two modes of visualization, tensor visualization must use volumetric (as opposed to point-or line-based) primitives in order to communicate its meaning. While various glyph-based tensor approaches have been proposed, they have focused primarily on positive definite, real symmetric tensors-tensors with matrix representations that are symmetric about the diagonal and have positive, real eigenvalues. Some real-world systems, such as the alignment of nematic liquid crystals, are defined by real symmetric traceless tensors-real symmetric tensors whose eigenvalues sum to zero. Traditional glyph-based visualization approaches break down for these tensors. Our work addresses this shortcoming by introducing a glyph parameterization motivated by the characteristics of nematic liquid crystals. These characteristics, like the generalization of diffusion tensor MRI properties to symmetric tensors, are applicable to any symmetric traceless tensor.</p><p>Both users and visualization researchers benefit from the work presented herein. First, users benefit from the glyphs perceptually mirroring expected physical behavior. As outlined in Section 2, nematic liquid crystals exhibit certain types of symmetry depending on the orientational order; the chosen glyphs reflect this symmetry. Previous approaches such as ellipsoidal or cylindrical glyphs do not display this symmetry. Second, visualization researchers benefit from our general method to depict symmetric traceless tensors. Our approach, discussed in Sections 3 and 4 and generalized in Section 5, demonstrates that the common practice offsetting the eigenvalues to create an artificial positive definite tensor is not always necessary and, in the case of nematic crystal visualization, potentially misleading.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">NEMATIC LIQUID CRYSTALS</head><p>Liquid crystals are an intermediate phase of matter that exist between the solid (crystal) and liquid phases of certain materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In this state, the molecules do not favor any particular position within a crystalline lattice; however, they do favor alignment with preferred directions throughout the material. Thus, over any small region, the molecules have a random distribution in space, but possess an overall average orientation. This average orientation is called the director n.</p><p>The change of the director over space and time is a chief feature of interest for liquid crystal studies. Nematic liquid crystals (NLC) are a class of liquid crystals with elongated molecules that form thread-like structures; this elongated shape gives the molecule a primary axis. When discussing such molecules, statistically significant collections of molecules are used. These collections come in two types based upon how the molecules are distributed: uniaxial and biaxial ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). In uniaxial arrangements, molecules are, on average, aligned with the director; such collections possess rotational symmetry about the director and can be modeled with a cylinder. Biaxial arrangements, in contrast, are still mostly aligned with the director but also have significant alignment with another axis of symmetry; this symmetry is reflective and not rotational. An appropriate biaxial glyph would be a rectangular box. It is important to note that, due to symmetry, the sign of the director and other axes is not uniquely determined; a director of n and −n are equivalent. Rarely, a small region of NLC molecules may have no significant alignment; such a collection is isotropic. Since individual NLC molecules have a primary axis, the alignment of this axis with the director is an important physical property. Over a collection of NLC molecules in a small region, the statistical average of this alignment represents the overall fidelity of the director as an approximation to the molecular arrangement-in other words, it represent the amount of (uniaxial) order. This average is known as the scalar order parameter S <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S = 1 2 3 cos 2 θ − 1<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where x represents the statistical average and θ is the angle between the primary axis of the NLC molecule and the the director. S varies from 1 when all the molecules align with the director to − 1 2 if the molecules are aligned primarily in the plane orthogonal to n. In the isotropic state, the molecules are randomly oriented, cos 2 θ = <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> 3 in the spherical region, and S will be 0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Physically, systems with S &lt; 0 are rare; such an S indicates that while the average orientation is along the director, the molecules have significant (but random) alignment within the perpendicular plane. Like the director, the change of the scalar order parameter over space and time is an important feature in NLC systems.</p><p>To simulate the behavior of NLC systems, an alignment tensor approach is common; the names order parameter tensor and Q tensor are also used. The tensor Q represents the director and the average alignment with the director simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Q (x,t) = S (x,t) (n (x,t) ⊗ n (x,t)) − 1 3 S (x,t) I</formula><p>where x is the current position, t is the current time step, n ⊗ n is the outer product of the director, and I is the identity matrix; no biaxilaity is present in the above formulation. This tensor is symmetric since Q i j = Sn i n j = Sn j n i = Q ji for off-diagonal elements; in addition, the trace of Q is zero since |n| = 1. The dynamics for the evolution of an NLC system typically depend on the Q tensor directly; thus, modeling the tensor is sufficient to describe the system. For a given NLC simulation, an induced director and scalar order parameter define an initial Q tensor at every point. As the simulation progresses, the Q tensor is updated; the new director, scalar order parameter, and other properties of the system are inferred from the new tensor. These values are extracted using eigenanalysis: Assuming the eigenvalues λ 1 , λ 2 , λ 3 of Q are sorted such that |λ 1 | ≥ |λ 2 | ≥ |λ 3 |, then, in the eigenvector frame, Q is represented as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">[Q] ε =   2 3 S − 1 3 S − 1 3 S   =   λ 1 λ 2 λ 3  </formula><p>In addition, the eigenvector v 1 corresponding to λ 1 is the overall director n represented in the lab frame (the frame of the simulation). However, this Q representation is only valid when the collection of NLC molecules described by the tensor are in a uniaxial arrangement; i.e., when λ 2 = λ 3 and there is no preferred second axis of symmetry. In general, the Q tensor will exhibit some amount of biaxality; this can be modeled as the amount of divergence b from the uniaxial tensor <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">[Q] ε =   2 3 S − 1 3 S − b s − 1 3 S + b s  <label>(2)</label></formula><p>where b s = sgn(S)b. The biaxiality b ranges from 0, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> 3 |S| , or, in terms of λ 1 , b ∈ 0, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> 2 |λ 1 | ; its maximum valid value is <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> 6 (see appendix). This measure of biaxality has a physical meaning; it corresponds to the strength of the biaxial terms from the spherical decomposition of the probability density functions of the NLC crystal ordering <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</p><p>The traceless nature of the Q tensor has significant consequences for the eigenanalysis of Q. First, sgn (λ 1 ) = − sgn (λ 2 ); this a consequence of Q being traceless. Similarly, the sign of λ 1 determines the sign of S. When λ 1 = −λ 2 (and by extension, λ 3 = 0 and b is maximized), the order parameter is ambiguous-a slight change in one eigenvalue causes the system to switch from positive to negative S. We call these cases neutral biaxial since the scalar order parameter's sign is ambiguous; by extension, positive uniaxial/biaxial and negative uniaxial/biaxial arrangements or tensors occur when S is unambiguously positive or negative respectively. When λ 1 = λ 2 = 0, the alignment is isotropic; unlike the neutral cases, S is well defined and equal to zero. This transition from positive to negative alignment, along with the amount of Q's biaxiality, will be used to parameterize our tensor glyphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">NLC TENSOR GLYPHS</head><p>Three salient properties of an NLC system were discussed in the previous section: • The director n</p><p>• The uniaxial scalar order parameter S</p><p>• The biaxial divergence parameter b</p><p>Each of these are derived from the eigenanalysis of the alignment tensor Q. Visualization of the Q tensor field should visually encode each of these three properties. Previously, the three major methods for depicting NLC tensor information used cylindrical <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, box <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, or ellipsoidal <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> glyphs; these methods echo approaches from other tensor visualization tasks, such as diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) visualization (for an overview, refer to Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>). While each method can successfully depict a portion of the important tensor information, they have their limitations as well:</p><p>• Cylindrical glyphs are ideal for uniaxial arrangements; their azimuthal axial symmetry is the same as that for a nematic molecule. However, since the non-azimuthal axes have equal magnitude, they are inappropriate for biaxial arrangements.</p><p>• Box glyphs are well suited for biaxial alignments. They possess reflective symmetry without rotational symmetry, and each axis may take on a separate length. However, this lack of rotational symmetry makes them inappropriate for uniaxial regions.</p><p>• Ellipsoidal glyphs address both these issues; they exhibit axial rotational symmetry at one extreme and reflective symmetry at another. But, as previously shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, they are ambiguous with respect to viewing-different view projections of the same ellipsoid produce glyphs that are indistinguishable from glyphs of a different tensor.</p><p>Unlike the previous shapes, superellipsoids possess the capabilities to distinguish the two separate types of symmetry needed for NLC arrangements without ambiguity; they are are the glyphs used in this work <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>). Superquadrics, introduced by <ref type="bibr">Barr [2]</ref>, are higher-order quadric surfaces with continuous, controllable shapes. Superellipsoids, like other superquadrics, use shape parameters α, β :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">e (θ , φ , α, β ) =    cos α s θ cos β s φ sin α s θ cos β s φ sin β s φ    −π ≤ θ ≤ π − π 2 ≤ φ ≤ π 2<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where x y s = sgn(x)|x| y . Superquadrics have been used in multi-variate visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, flow visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and in DT-MRI tensor visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. A significant advantage of superquadric glyphs is their ability to model data features perceptually; experimental studies have verified their discernability for feature encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Inspired by the work of Kindlmann for DT-MRI visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, we have adopted superellipsoid-based glyphs for our approach. However, we utilize a different parameterization and collection of superellipsoids for two reasons. First, Kindlmann's shapes, based upon Westin's shape characterizations from DT-MRI studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, are inappropriate for NLC systems-they do not perceptually capture negative uniaxial arrangements, for example. Secondly, Westin's shape metrics cannot be directly applied since our tensor is traceless. While one could offset the eigenvalues by a constant to make them all positive-multiples of the trace of Q 2 is a common choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>-this does not preserve all the features of an NLC system ( <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). Section 4 discusses this limitation in more detail.</p><p>Our parameterization is based upon two observations regarding the superellipsoid shape space <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>). First, the vertical α = 1 line is particularly striking; it naturally encodes uniaxial arrangements. The shapes on this line possess the correct axial symmetry, and the "pinching" that occurs for β &gt; 1 corresponds intuitively to the increasing distribution of molecules in the plane perpendicular to the director as S approaches − 1 2 . Secondly, as α approaches zero, the axial symmetry of the shapes decreases while reflective symmetry increases; this corresponds nicely to increasing biaxality in an NLC collection. Thus, relations between α and biaxiality and between β and uniaxial order form the basis of our glyphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">NLC Tensor Glyph Generation</head><p>The creation of an NLC tensor glyph is a five step process. We start with an alignment tensor Q sampled at position x and its absolute magnitude sorted eigenvalues λ 1 , λ 2 , λ 3 . These eigenvalues are known as the major, medium, and minor eigenvalues respectively; the corresponding eigenvectors v 1 , v 2 , v 3 are the major eigenvector and so on. We can also derive n = v 1 , S = <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> 2 λ 1 and b = 1 2 λ 1 + λ 3 from our equations for Q (Equation 2). <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Given these values, we first determine the tensor's shape characteristics, then calculate the superellipsoid parameters, scale by the glyph scaling factors, and finally align the glyph based upon the eigenframe. This section explains these steps.</p><p>Shape metrics are useful for identifying a tensor <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>; in our case, the shape is used to induce a pair of barycentric coordinate systems over our superellipsoids (see the appendix for details). We define four shape metrics-µ u + is proportional to the strength of positive uniaxial alignment, µ u − is similarly defined for negative alignment, µ b measures the amount of biaxiality, and µ i measures how isotropic the collection is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">µ u + = −3λ 3 S ≥ 0 0 S &lt; 0 (4) µ u − = 0 S ≥ 0 6λ 3 S &lt; 0 (5) µ b = 6b = |3λ 1 + 6λ 3 | (6) µ i = 1 − 3 2 λ 1 S ≥ 0 1 + 3λ 1 S &lt; 0<label>(7)</label></formula><p>All the metrics vary between zero and one; a value of one in any metric means the collection's shape is entirely characterized by that metric. For example, if µ u + = 1, the other metrics are zero and the collection is purely positive uniaxial. The two barycentric spaces using these measures are the positive alignment space described by (µ u + , 1 2 µ b , µ i ), and the negative alignment space with coordinates (µ u − , µ b , µ i ). Along the µ u + = µ u − = 0 line (the border between these spaces), as µ i decreases, µ b and |S| also increase. Since λ 1 = −λ 2 on this border, the system is neutrally biaxial.</p><p>Given barycentric shape coordinates, the tensor shape can be defined. We have two spaces of tensor shapes corresponding to the positive and negative alignment spaces:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">µ u + ≥ 0, µ u − = 0 ⇒ α = (1 − µ b ) γ b β = (1 − µ u + ) γ u µ u + = 0, µ u − &gt; 0 ⇒ α = (1 − µ b ) γ b β = 1 + 3µ γ u u −<label>(8)</label></formula><p>This parameterization uses the α/biaxiality and β /uniaxiality correspondence discussed previously; the positive alignment space is mapped to α × β ∈ [0, 1] × [0, 1] and the negative alignment space is mapped to α × β ∈ [0, 1] × <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. These regions correspond to the union of the shaded regions in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Like Kindlmann, we use sharpness parameters γ b , γ u to modulate the edge sharpness of the superellipsoid glyphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The next step to generate an NLC tensor glyph is to determine the scale of the glyph. Recall, we cannot use the eigenvalues directly due to the traceless nature of the tensor-some eigenvalues will be negative or zero. Thus, we encode other properties of the NLC system as the axes radii. Scale factors are determined such that the magnitude of the axes orthogonal to the director increases as uniaxial order decreases; this represents the increasing alignment with the orthogonal planes. In addition, the ratio of length of the minor and medium axes decreases <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Numerically, finding b this way is more stable than the traditional b = as biaxiality increases-more biaxiality means more disparity in size: <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> Typical values of the minimum and maximum scaling factors s min , s max are 0.1 and 0.5 respectively; these produce shapes which fit inside a unit cube. If the cell containing a glyph is smaller/larger than a unit cube, the scaling factors can be chosen to fit the glyph into the chosen region. Note that these scaling factors are the same when µ u + = µ u − = 0; in that case, µ i = 1 − 1 2 µ b (see appendix). The orientation of the glyph is the last element to be determined. The eigenvectors v i define the conversion from the eigenvector representation of Q to its representation in the lab frame. This change-ofbasis transform is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">µ u + ≥ µ u − ⇒      s x = s min + (s max − s min ) µ i s y = s min + (s max − s min ) (1 − µ u + ) s z = s max (9) µ u + &lt; µ u − ⇒      s x = s min + (s max − s min ) 1 − 1 2 µ b s y = s max s z = s max</formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">V (Q) = sgn (v 2 • v 1 ) v 3 v 2 v 1 = l m n<label>(11)</label></formula><p>This alignment is chosen such that</p><p>• The director n/major eigenvector v 1 aligns with the major axis of the superellipsoidẑ</p><p>• The medium eigenvector aligns with the second largest scaling factor. The axis encodes the increase in biaxiality.</p><p>• The minor eigenvector aligns with the smallest scaling factor. In addition, a right-handed coordinated frame is ensured.</p><p>This alignment is analogous to the system for positive definite tensors. The final tensor glyph parameterization is (via equations 3-11): <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> illustrates the glyphs. As designed, there is a smooth transition between purely aligned arrangements (left of the figure) towards biaxial arrangements (right of the figure); as biaxiality increases, the minor and medium scaling factors diverge as well. The direction of the director is clearly encoded. Finally, positive and negative alignment is distinguished by the aforementioned "pinching" in the plane orthogonal to the director. The effectiveness of these glyphs will be demonstrated in the next section.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">e (Q, x, θ , φ ) = V (Q) S (Q) e (θ , φ , α (Q) , β (Q)) + x = l m n   s x s y s z      cos α s θ cos β s φ sin α s θ cos β s φ sin β s φ    + x (12)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">EXAMPLES AND DISCUSSION</head><p>For our examples, we utilize an unstructured grid simulation of a biomolecule in a nematic medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Due to the presence of the biomolecule, discontinuities in the director alignment occurs-what starts out in a unixial alignment will diverge into both positive and negative biaxial cases. Our first example ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>) provides both an overview and close-up of two methods: An ellipsoid-tensor based approach that offsets the eigenvalues by a fixed value <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and our approach.</p><p>Both methods present an effective high-level overview of the tensor field. It is in the detail window that the differences between the techniques become apparent. In the ellipsoid view, differences in the ellipsoids indicate a possible change in director orientation or scalar order strength; however, it is unclear which possibility dominates. In our approach, the change is clearer-the director changes along with the sign of the order parameter. The strong difference in shape pre-attentively communicates the presence of an important feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>-the large region of negative biaxial alignment in the center of the zoomed region. The presence of these negative alignments cannot be gleaned from the offset-based approach. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> further illustrates the issues with offset-based approaches for traceless tensor visualization. After applying an offset, it may no longer be the case that |λ 1 | &gt; |λ 2 |; if the major eigenvalue was originally negative, it becomes the smallest of the new values when positive. If one naively extracts the director from this new system, an incorrect choice is made-the largest modified eigenvalue is not the largest in absolute magnitude within the original system <ref type="figure">(Figure 3b)</ref>. Even if the correct director is extracted <ref type="figure">(Figure 3c</ref>), the inappropriateness (for cylindrical) or rotational ambiguity (for box and ellipsoid) of the glyph is still present. This ambiguity has been noticed in liquid cyrstal physics <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and in general tensor visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Our approach avoids these issues by using a distinguishable glyph based upon the system's physics.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">! u+ =1 ! u-=1 ! b =1 ! i =1</formula><p>Our last example uses the metrics and scale factors defined by Equations 4-7 and 9-10, but apply them to four different glyphs shapescylinders, boxes, ellipses, and our superquadrics ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>). Note, only the superquadrics utilize the α and β parameterization to modify shape; the other glyphs can only use their scaling to communicate the NLC characteristics. The "sharpness" of the the cylindrical and box representations quickly draw the eye; however, they convey little additional information beyond the existence of significant biaxiality in the viewed region. The ellipsoid representation also fails to communicate more than the presence of biaxiality. Only our approach, which uses the shape and the shape's relative scales to communicate information, clearly shows the negative biaxiality region present at the center of the This change is more difficult to perceive using previous approaches. simulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">User Evaluation and Prototype Implementation</head><p>The examples from the previous section are based upon the data in use by our collaborators. We have provided them a system implementing the NLC tensor glyphs; it is built using C++ and OpenGL. The unstructured grid tensor data displayed has 37,135 nodes; a glyph is generated for each node and stored in a display list. Depending on the resolution of the glyph used (i.e., the number of θ and φ divisions in Equation 12), the initial pre-processing time for data loading and glyph generation varies between 32-64 seconds. The system allows interactive viewing of the data with rates of 10 frames per second. All timings were performed on a 3.6 GHz Pentium 4 with 1 GB main memory and an NVidia 6800 Ultra GPU with 256 MB video memory under Windows XP SP2. If performance becomes a concern, such as when the size or density of the grid increases, the number of displayed glyphs could be decreased (e.g., only glyphs with strong biaxiality could be shown). Alternatively, a canonical sampling of the tensor shape space could be performed; tensors with barycentric shape coordinates within a threshold would use the corresponding pre-stored glyph.</p><p>Our collaborators found several benefits of our work. Before using our method, they used one of two approaches to depict the alignment data. To visualize the director field, a "hedge-hog" oriented line was used; strength of the scalar order parameter or biaxiality was depicted via an isosurface. They found the tensor version succinctly and quickly communicated all three features simultaneously; the direction of the glyph was self-evident and the perceptually distinct shapes effectively encoded S and b's relative strengths. For their primary task, finding defects in the nematic medium-which predominantly occur in areas of high biaxiality-the change in symmetry cues over a region effectively highlight defects ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5, bottom)</ref>. Such change in shape is less perceptible with the other glyphs. They also found that the shapes assisted in the perception of depth, especially compared to their previous analysis. Finally, since the glyphs have no inherent color or texture, these channels can be used to communicate other information of interest to them, such as redundantly encoding biaxial strength via color. Our collaborators feel that the system will have significant positive impact on their work.</p></div>

Such glyphs use the Equations 8-12 with one modification: µ δ replaces 2µ b in Equation 10. The generated glyphs are similar to those used by the NLC tensors except for the latter's use of two separate λ max 's-one for positive S (λ max = <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> 3 ) and one for negative S (λ max = <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> 3 ). Two different maximums were used in order to expand the visually depicted space and for physically motivated reasons; this is the cause for the replacement in Equation 10 (see the appendix for further discussion). <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Negative Uniaxial</head><formula xml:id="formula_17">µ -=1 (µ + , µ' i , µ ! ) (µ -, µ' i , µ ! ) Positive Uniaxial µ + =1 µ ! =1 Neutral Biaxial Isotropic µ' i =1</formula><p>In a manner similar to how Westin's DT-MRI shape metrics encode the amount of characteristic shape (linear, planar, or spherical) a general real symmetric tensors possesses, our metrics encode the amount of characteristic shape (positive/negative uniaxial, neutral biaxial, isotropic) any real symmetric traceless tensor possesses. Like Westin's metrics, ours are motivated by a physical system. However, though their design philosophies are similar, the two sets metrics are very different. They are not special cases of one another-Westin's metrics are not defined for traceless tensors (due to a divide by zero) and our metrics are not barycentric for non-traceless tensors. Similarly, the superellipsoid space used by our work is distinct from that used by Kindlmann; though there is some overlap, we use a larger space to encode negative "alignment" and the reflective, nonrotational symmetry not present in DT-MRI systems. Our approach and Westin/Kindlmann's are separate applications to separate classes of tensors. Interesting future research would be to generate a common set of metrics for unified tensor visualization; the disparity in characteristics shapes and eigenspaces will make this a challenge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We have introduced a collection of physically-motivated, barycentric shape metrics to define a superellipsoid parameterization for nematic liquid crystal alignment tensors. Through use of these metrics, the salient properties of an NLC system are graphically encoded in a perceptually and mathematically continuous manner. We also generalized this approach to any real symmetric traceless tensor. Our contributions demonstrate a method to visualize symmetric, traceless tensors without the need to artificially modify the tensor's eigen-representation; unlike offset methods, our approach does not distort features of interest.</p><p>This work continues the use of superquadric glyphs in tensor visualization started by Kindlmann <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. These glyph's demonstrated efficacy here and in other visualization domains (e.g., multi-variate visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>) suggests that they require more study. Specifically, their potential application to antisymmetric fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and comparisons with other higher-order glyphs, such as spherical harmonics <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> bear investigation. Additional perceptual studies should also be conducted; we are currently conducting such a study comparing our NLC glyphs to previous techniques.</p><p>NLC alignment tensor visualization is only part of a larger problem of interest to physicists. Rapid changes in orientation, scalar order parameter, and other properties form discontinuities-so called disclinations; these imperfections have physical consequences that are actively studied. Many automated <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> or visual <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> methods use the director field to find defects; there are some tensor-based visual approaches as well (e.g., Sonnet et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>). Tensor-based disclination detection and visualization methods are potential fruitful areas to explore. Physically-based improvements to our methods, such as investigating other biaxiality models <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> or vector grouping schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, are also of interest.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NLC Barycentric Spaces</head><p>For the NLC glyphs, we note that the eigenvalues fall in the range λ i ∈ − 1 3 , <ref type="bibr">2 3</ref> given the expression for Q (Equation 2) and that S ∈ − 1 2 , 1 ; this range is physically motivated <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Thus, we could chose λ max = 2 3 in Equations 16-19 to create NLC glyphs. However, this gives equal visual weight to glyphs which are not physically meaningful.</p><p>Consider S = ± 1 2 . In this case, λ 2 ∈ ∓ <ref type="bibr">1 6</ref> , ∓ 1 3 depending on b (which has the range b = 0, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> 3 S , or in this case, b = 0, <ref type="bibr">1 6</ref> ). This system is physically valid. However, for any S &gt; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> 2 , values of b &gt; <ref type="bibr">1 6</ref> are mathematically possible; this leads to illegal values of λ 2 :</p><p>Therefore, b is restricted to the range 0, min <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> 6 , 1 3 S . Since the range of b is limited, using the full range of the tensor space when λ max = <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> 3 is not visually efficient. Instead, we subdivide the space so that two maximums are used: λ max = <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> 3 when S ≥ 0 and λ max = 1 3 when S &lt; 0. We thus have two spaces if we substitute the values into Equations 16-19:</p><p>While these two spaces share a border, the metrics are not continuous across them-given a fixed Q in a neutral biaxial state, µ</p><p>. In addition, since the maximum of b is <ref type="bibr">1 6</ref> , µ δ | λ max = 2 3 ∈ 0, 1 2 . Our goal is not to make the NLC barycentric spaces continuous, but to make the shape space continuous while using the largest subsection of it as possible. Towards that end, the metrics are mapped as so:</p><p>With this mapping, the entire α, β space defined for our general tensors are used by the NLC tensors, with a little extra region in the α &lt; 0 region (light-shaded area in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). The only other effect of this mapping is the use of 1 2 µ b instead of the expected µ b in Equation 10.</p><p>This is done to have a continuous change in scale along the neutral biaxial line (where λ 3 = 0):</p><p>Eqs. 9-10</p></div>			</div>
