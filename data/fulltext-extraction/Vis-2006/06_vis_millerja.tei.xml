			<abstract>
				<p>We present GyVe, an interactive visualization tool for understanding structure in sparse three-dimensional (3D) point data. The scientific goal driving the tool&apos;s development is to determine the presence of filaments and voids as defined by inferred 3D galaxy positions within the Horologium-Reticulum supercluster (HRS). GyVe provides visualization techniques tailored to examine structures defined by the intercluster galaxies. Specific techniques include: interactive user control to move between a global overview and local viewpoints, labelled axes and curved drop lines to indicate positions in the astronomical RA-DEC-cz coordinate system, torsional rocking and stereo to enhance 3D perception, and geometrically distinct glyphs to show potential correlation between intercluster galaxies and known clusters. We discuss the rationale for each design decision and review the success of the techniques in accomplishing the scientific goals. In practice, GyVe has been useful for gaining intuition about structures that were difficult to perceive with 2D projection techniques alone. For example, during their initial session with GyVe, our collaborators quickly confirmed scientific conclusions regarding the large-scale structure of the HRS previously obtained over months of study with 2D projections and statistical techniques. Further use of GyVe revealed the spherical shape of voids and showed that a presumed filament was actually two disconnected structures.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Observational astronomy has benefited greatly from modern spectroscopic technology that permits redshift surveys of tens to hundreds of thousands of extragalactic objects. These surveys produce, among other pertinent information, inferred distances to the observed objects. Such information promotes the understanding of the structure within the survey volume. In turn, the structural information can help to constrain cosmological models of structure formation and evolution.</p><p>Though galaxies are objects embedded in three-dimensional (3D) space, perception of structure has traditionally been accomplished with static two-dimensional (2D) projections of the data, either as a range of redshift values in rectangular slices or in a spatial-redshift plot such as a cone diagram. Structure recognition in this way involves identifying potential structures in one projection and verifying them in other projections over different dimensions. This process is tedious and hinders intuition about the overall shape of the structures present. Furthermore, the interconnectedness of structures is often obscured by switching among numerous projections of the dataset.</p><p>Our collaborators wanted a visualization system that would heighten intuition about their data, support some of the tasks carried out in traditional 2D analysis, and provide a conduit to other statistical tools. We created GyVe, a 3D visualization tool, to fulfill these requirements. To ensure GyVe's usefulness in its prescribed tasks, we incorporated feedback from our collaborators throughout the development cycle. The end result is an application that our collaborators have integrated into their set of analysis tools.</p><p>In this paper, we review some of the scientific goals driving GyVe's design and review specific lessons learned from both the visualization and astronomical perspectives. In Section 2, we review previous visualization work related to astronomical data. Section 3 provides astronomical background and describes data issues. In Section 4, we explain the specific techniques implemented in the GyVe application and discuss the motivation for using those techniques. Sections 5 and 6 highlight specific examples of lessons learned from astronomy and visualization, respectively. Lastly, in Section 7 we provide a summary of our work and future directions.  • Matthew C. <ref type="bibr">Fleenor</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Much work has been done on using point-based primitives to express structural characteristics in point data, but these techniques are not applicable to understanding structure of intercluster galaxies. Several techniques focus on substituting points for polygons as primitives to render large polygonal models rapidly <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>[13] <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Krüger et al. use animated point primitives to implicitly show the structure of 3D flows <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, but astronomical point data can be shown explicitly. Grigoryan and Rheingans use points to show surface uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, but our goals do not include displaying uncertainty in galaxy positions. Two techniques use points of different sizes to represent galaxies in large-scale simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, but they are targeted to denser data.</p><p>Early work in visualization of astronomical data focuses on telling the story of astronomical phenomena. The pioneering work of Geller et al. in visualizing sky survey data is the first to show the 3D structure of galaxy positions. They use geometry-distorted textures of elliptical and spiral galaxies to create a visually-appealing animation for general audiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>[8] <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, but express frustration that lack of interactivity afforded by their then-available computing hardware inhibits understanding of the structure of galaxies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Similarly, Genetti and Kahler et al. describe methods for creating non-interactive educational animations of astronomical phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Several visualization tools for viewing astronomical point data exist. The Cosmic Explorer is a virtual reality environment for the CAVE that uses gesture recognition to select portions of a galaxy dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Christensen uses SGI Explorer to display galaxies from several sky surveys as spheres, but does not provide reference frames for orientation and does not differentiate between clusters and intercluster galaxies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Partiview is an application for interactively viewing star and galaxy data that provides orientation aids including axes and constellations on the celestial sphere, but no frame of reference that spans the physical dimensions of the data set in the Right Ascension-Declination-recessional velocity (RA-DEC-cz) coordinate system is provided. Information about a celestial object is displayed when it is picked with the mouse, but objects cannot be interactively partitioned into groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. AstroMD is an astronomical analysis and visualization tool that is most similar to our work. While AstroMD features numerous visualization techniques, it lacks two of the techniques we found to be particularly useful for achieving the scientific goals: curved drop lines and interactive partitioning of galaxies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>None of the previous work fully addresses our collaborators needs. In particular, two of our collaborators' requirements have been left unmet. Our collaborators required the ability to interactively partition galaxies into groups so that they could define structures they observed. To stay oriented to the data, they also needed to have visual cues to accurately determine the location of particular galaxies in the RA-DEC-cz coordinate system. Our visualization system addresses the first requirement by providing an interactive mechanism for partitioning galaxies in the visualization interface. To address the second requirement, our system uses curved drop lines that follow the RA-DEC-cz coordinate system as visual cues for determining galaxy locations. To our knowledge, previous works have not incorporated these two features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">ASTRONOMICAL BACKGROUND</head><p>This section provides background on the astronomical concepts and methods associated with the data visualized in GyVe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Overview</head><p>Detecting and characterizing the large-scale structure of galaxy distributions in the universe is currently an active research area in observational astronomy and cosmology. Conglomerations of visible and dark matter called superclusters, which are observed as extended galaxy overdensities, are the largest known ordered structures. Our astronomer collaborators are interested in one of the largest such strucures in the local universe, the Horologium-Reticulum supercluster (HRS). Like similar superclusters, the HRS is an extended galaxy overdensity consisting of two primary visible constituents: about 20 dense, highly populated galaxy clusters and more diffuse intercluster regions. While in the past galaxy clusters were accepted as tracers of supercluster structures, modern surveys provide ample data about intercluster galaxies, permitting the probing of structure within those regions as well.</p><p>Our astronomer colleagues are currently studying whether intercluster galaxies exhibit ordered substructure within the HRS. Two angular coordinates, Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (DEC), specify each galaxy location in the sky. A third radial dimension is also inferred from a recessional velocity (cz) which is determined from the galaxy's spectroscopic redshift. Together, these three coordinates represent, to a first-order approximation, the 3D position of a galaxy in the HRS. The establishment of 3D galaxy positions is essential to any study of the megaparsec-scale structure because it reveals the volumetric properties of galaxy distributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Observations</head><p>In this section, we describe how the observations of the HRS intercluster galaxies were conducted. Topics include observational instrumentation, redshift measurements from optical spectroscopy, data representation, and observational limitations. Lastly, we discuss two types of observation data included within the GyVe system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Data Collection</head><p>Due to the relativistic Doppler relation, observed light from a receding galaxy has a longer wavelength than that of the original emitted light. The ratio between an object's observed and emitted light defines the spectroscopic redshift, z, and is given by </p><p>This measurement serves as a first-order approximation to a celestial object's distance from Earth. Our collaborators' redshift data was collected by a multi-fiber spectrograph called 6dF (6-degree field) that operates in conjunction with the UK Schmidt Telescope at the Anglo Australian Observatory <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. 6dF places light-collecting prism buttons on a metal guide plate at the specific locations where the galaxies resolve on the telescope focal plane. This light is sent through a fiber optic cable to an offtelescope spectrograph from which the redshift is determined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Coordinate System</head><p>Data is stored in the RA-DEC-cz coordinate system. RA and DEC coordinates are akin to longitude and latitude, but they designate celestial sphere locations instead of locations on the Earth. Although the cz coordinate is an implied velocity derived from the redshift data (i.e., multiplied by the speed of light, c), at the redshift of the HRS (z ≈ 0.06), we convert the redshift z to a luminosity distance</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d L according to ( ) ( ) ( ) 0 1 1 1 2 0 q L z z H c d − + − + = (2)</formula><p>where we have assumed a critical value for the deceleration parameter, q 0 = ½. H 0 is the Hubble constant at the present time where we assume a value of 70 km s</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">-1 Mpc -1</formula><p>. This constant specifies the cosmological expansion as a recessional velocity per distance, measured in megaparsecs (Mpc).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Limitations</head><p>The relationship between a galaxy's redshift and its inferred distance from Earth is based on the assumption that the galaxy's line-of-sight motion depends solely on the general expansion of the universe. However, local gravitational influences on a galaxy introduce a second component in the galaxy's motion. This motion, called the peculiar motion, prevents the redshift from being construed as a true distance measure. Specifically, peculiar motion away from the observer makes a galaxy appear to be at a greater distance than it actually is, while motion toward the observer makes it appear closer than it is. For galaxies in clusters, the relatively large peculiar motion significantly affects their apparent positions. Another issue arises because of the observational constraints of the telescope, both in capability and time allocation. The optical design of the telescope imposes a lower threshold on the apparent brightness (b J &lt; 17.5) of observable objects. This means that data from only a small fraction of the actual number of galaxies in the HRS is available. Furthermore, only 60% of the known galaxies within the brightness limit have measured redshifts. This constraint exists because there are a limited number of nights allocated to observe the HRS. Both the optical and allocation constraints are normal for any astronomical study and impact conclusions from the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">Data Types</head><p>The HRS galaxy positions constitute a sparse 3D point dataset. In addition, external observations of known galaxy clusters are also incorporated into the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The two data types are distinct, and each contains different information. The galaxy data contain position, redshift, apparent brightness, and survey ID information. The cluster data contain the name, approximate center position, and mean redshift information. Separating known galaxy clusters from the intercluster galaxies is essential for the purposes of the study. By removing individual cluster galaxies, the redshift distortions on the galaxies caused by significant peculiar motion within a cluster are suppressed. In redshift space, cluster galaxy members stretch out into the intercluster regions, affecting how the surrounding structures are interpreted. The inclusion of cluster locations, however, is desirable because they serve as guideposts for the largest mass concentrations in the HRS. Moreover, displaying the positional relationship between cluster locations and intercluster structures could yield interesting astronomical insights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">VISUALIZATION SYSTEM</head><p>GyVe has been specifically designed to aid astronomers as they study intercluster structure. In this section, we first discuss GyVe's user interface. We then discuss the visualization techniques we applied and justify why we thought they would be effective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Application</head><p>GyVe is a cross-platform application written in Python <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> that uses TKinter for the user interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) as the visualization backend <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. It was developed concurrently under Windows and Linux, and should be portable to any system that runs Python, TKinter, and VTK. The application is available at http://gyve.sourceforge.net.</p><p>The user interface is divided into two sections, one for visualization controls, and one for the visualization itself. The controls allow adjustments of the visualization parameters, including the ability to show or hide groups of galaxies, turn reference axes on and off, and enable or disable torsional rocking. The visualization window displays the data and allows interactive rotation, panning, and zooming, along with cursor-based querying and picking of galaxies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Visualization Techniques</head><p>We describe several visualization techniques used to display the galaxy data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Glyphs</head><p>We could have used pixel-sized points to represent galaxies and clusters, but we chose to represent individual galaxy positions as spherical glyphs of the same size and cluster centers as cylindrical glyphs of the same size. Glyphs have at least four advantages over pixel-sized points for representing galaxy and cluster positions in our dataset. First, due to the sparse nature of the data, point representations are an inefficient use of screen real-estate that could be better exploited for visual communication. Second, even if we used multi-pixel points, it would be difficult to distinguish between galaxies and clusters; representing the two categories of objects with distinct shapes allows the viewer to quickly differentiate between them. Third, because glyphs have size, perspective provides an effective depth cue because of scaling. Finally, glyphs occlude each other in more obvious ways than points, providing another effective depth cue. In GyVe, glyph groups can be interactively resized to find a balance between depth cue perspective and occlusion. Of course, there are performance considerations when using tessellated glyphs because of the number of polygons it takes to represent them. Only several thousand objects exist in the dataset, however, making this technique feasible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.2.2</head><p>Nominal Color Encoding GyVe uses color to distinguish different groups of galaxies. Because we are not encoding other data via color on the galaxy or cluster glyphs, we are able to use color for encoding nominal data that describes group membership. A nominal color-coding scheme controlled automatically by GyVe ensures a suitable collection of distinguishable colors. The choices of colors are the 11 identified by Berlin and Kay in their cross-cultural study of nameable colors <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> with the addition of cyan as recommended by Ware <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. To eliminate potential confusion between galaxies and clusters sharing the same color, one of the 12 colors (orange) is reserved for cluster glyphs. Black is reserved for the background, leaving colors for up to 10 groups</p><p>1 . In the user interface, the galaxy group list displays the color associated with each group in the visualization, making the 1 For improved visual quality on a printed medium, GyVe has a "print" mode that sets the background to white and provides dark gray as a group color; all images in this paper have been rendered in print mode. association between the group and its name instantaneous and intuitive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.2.3</head><p>Structure-From-Motion As Ware points out, structure-from-motion resulting from motion parallax is very important for the perception of 3D structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Hence, GyVe allows standard rotation, panning, and zooming of the scene with mouse interactions. Since the astronomer is in control of the visualization directly, he or she can gain a greater sense of structure than that afforded by non-interactive motion techniques, such as animations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.2.4</head><p>Torsional Rocking While interactive control over the view of the scene is a powerful way to perceive depth, sometimes it is useful to keep the scene in motion but keep the view centered on one particular place. GyVe uses torsional rocking of the scene, which mimics the motion of a torsional pendulum, for this purpose. When torsional rocking is enabled, the viewer can ponder a particular view while maintaining a sense of depth.</p><p>The torsional rocking is achieved by rotating the scene about the view up-vector passing through the focal point. The angle α of the rotation is controlled by the equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">) sin( 2 1 x = α (3)</formula><p>where the parameter x is incremented by π/16 every thirtieth of a second. Each rotation is relative to the viewing angle resulting from the previous rotation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.5">Stereo</head><p>GyVe supports stereo displays that provide depth perception even when the scene is not in motion. Users can adjust the eye separation parameter interactively to find a comfortable setting. While this feature is not essential to perception of shape, it is a complement to the other techniques used for conveying structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.6">Reference Axes</head><p>One of the complaints our colleagues had about a previous 3D visualization of their data was that it was easy to lose a sense of orientation to the data. One way we addressed this problem was by displaying reference axes of the RA-DEC-cz coordinate system. The axes appear as the outline of a truncated pyramid with a rounded base. Along each side of the pyramid is a grid of reference curves labeled by coordinate values. The user has the option of selecting which sides of the truncated pyramid are visible. The curves and labels that comprise the axes are colored with a just-noticeablydifferent color than the background to avoid distracting the viewer from the primary information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.2.7</head><p>Curved Drop Lines In addition to providing the RA-DEC-cz reference axes, GyVe provides the ability to show curved lines from selected galaxies to one or more of the axes pyramid sides. These curved lines follow the curved RA-DEC-cz coordinate frame. This direct connection between galaxies and their 2D projections provides a useful way to orient the viewer to the data, and allows for fairly precise location of structures in the data that can later be improved with statistical techniques. The curved lines show the reference coordinate system better than straight lines would and provide cues for comparing coordinate values among several objects.</p><p>Other strategies, such as displaying shadows on a reference surface, would not have been effective for two reasons. First, even though the data is sparse, there are enough galaxies that matching a particular galaxy with its shadow would be difficult at best. Second, the RA-DEC-cz coordinate system is a polar coordinate system, meaning a viewer would need to follow the shadow through a curved space back to the galaxy that cast it, something that is not intuitive or, even if the user understands the coordinate space well, easy to do. Drawing curved lines between galaxies and the reference axes relieves cognitive strain on the viewer caused by these problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Galaxy Selection</head><p>Our collaborators requested the ability to interactively partition the dataset of galaxies based on a qualitative analysis of the structures therein. For example, a long filament of galaxies would be an interesting structure they would like to distinguish from galaxies not in the filament. We provided this capability through galaxy selection with the mouse. The user first selects an active group in the user interface. Then, the user moves the mouse pointer over the galaxy to add to the active group and changes the membership of the galaxy from its previous group to the active group through the user interface. The active group can then be saved to a separate file for further study in GyVe or offline tools, a feature essential for our collaborators' analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">LESSONS LEARNED: ASTRONOMY</head><p>Because the traditional methods of visualizing redshift data use 2D rectangular slices and cone projections, we are interested in how 3D visualization in GyVe complements previous conclusions from 2D views and extends our collaborators' intuition about new datasets. Furthermore, because GyVe also permits user interaction with the data, users are able to carry out many functions similar to the 2D techniques previously employed. We review below a few examples where GyVe has reaffirmed previous conclusions from 2D and has led to new intuitions regarding the HRS structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Qualitative Confirmation of Quantitative Analysis</head><p>One of the original conclusions Fleenor et al. made regarding the large-scale structure of the HRS was that it appears as two distinct galaxy overdensity components roughly parallel to one another along a best-fit axis in RA-DEC-cz space <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This conclusion resulted from both visual examination of rectangular 2D redshift slices and the establishment of a primary spatial-redshift axis via linear regression techniques. To summarize, each galaxy was spatially projected onto an initial east-west principal axis, and a linear correlation was calculated between redshift and position along that principal axis. The position angle of the principal axis was then rotated in 10º increments through 180° with a linear correlation calculated at every increment to determine the best-fit spatialredshift axis. The HRS member galaxies were plotted along the bestfit axis, where they naturally segregated into two parallel components.</p><p>When loading the same dataset into GyVe, a similar qualitative result is obtained through visualization and galaxy selection. With the ability to freely rotate the view, the same primary spatial-redshift axis is discovered quite readily. The rough boundaries of the HRS in the cz dimension are also immediately discernable and visually confirmed with GyVe. Once the spatial-redshift axis is visually refined, our collaborators are able to interactively select the two overdense components within the HRS region. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> shows a GyVe snapshot of the HRS intercluster galaxy distribution with galaxies grouped into two parallel components; drop lines from each galaxy indicate the positions of the two groups. Within the cz boundaries of the HRS defined by Fleenor et al., one of our collaborators was able to pick out over 95% of the same member galaxies from each HRS component identified statistically. This visually intuitive method using GyVe quickly affirms a very similar arrangement of the two overdensity components in the HRS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Augmented Perception</head><p>A second survey of the HRS yielded a 200% increase in the number of measured redshifts of intercluster galaxies. With the substantial increase in the observational data, one task for GyVe is to aid in gaining intuition of the newly apparent and detailed structures now resolvable. GyVe's ability to freely control the viewing angle and select subgroups from the dataset permits unique opportunities to examine the volumetric characteristics of intercluster structures. Defining void properties and selecting galaxy filaments are two examples where GyVe proves useful in the perception of new structures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">Void Definition</head><p>While detecting underdense regions is feasible with traditional 2D slices, it is difficult to resolve their actual shapes. When our collaborators initially loaded the more heavily sampled dataset into GyVe, one of their first perceptions was the spherical shape of the underdense regions. Because they could easily group galaxies in GyVe, our collaborators used the tool to determine the initial diameter estimate of the void structures. For each void, they established a preferred viewing angle that allowed for clear distinction between the underdense interior and the overdense exterior. They then created a new group, using the mouse pointer to select and assign individual galaxies along the void's overdense rim to the new group (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3)</ref>. Finally, they saved the group for geometric analysis outside of GyVe to determine the void center and dimensions. GyVe makes locating void structures, which are otherwise difficult to conceptualize in 2D and computationally intensive to identify mathematically, relatively straightforward. Our collaborators selected boundaries on a total of six underdense regions in the manner described above. While there was obvious subjectivity in which points were originally chosen to define a void region, the large sample size (N &gt; 50) reduced the error in the estimate of the void center, providing an initial numerical value.</p><p>The initial estimate was improved with further statistical analysis outside of GyVe. This involved selecting a set of diametrically opposed galaxy pairs from the void rim in GyVe. In a separate program, the midpoint of each galaxy pair was calculated and the six midpoints with the highest and lowest values in each of the RA, DEC, and cz dimension were thrown out. The mean of the remaining midpoints was taken as an estimate of the void center. Next, an iterative minimization of galaxy counts was carried out as a function of radius and candidate void center positions in the vicinity of the estimated void center.</p><p>Our collaborators can also probe the potential relationship between the intercluster voids and known galaxy clusters. This GyVe feature permits the simultaneous examination of vastly different structures (in terms of size and density). <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows that the galaxy clusters do not reside within the voids and leads to deeper questions regarding the possible structural relationship between the two. Heightened intuition as a result of GyVe visualization provides a conceptual starting point to pose and address cosmological questions of this sort.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">Filament Selection</head><p>Another class of large-scale structures recently receiving attention in astronomical literature is intercluster filaments of galaxies. There is a fair amount of qualitative definition when it comes to actual filament selection. We use GyVe as a visual aid in the selection and confirmation of continuous filamentary structures. The top panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows a potential filament (red galaxies) previously identified with a traditional 2D plot of a redshift slice (thickness of 2000 km s -1 ~ 20 h o -1 Mpc) of the 6dF dataset. With 3D rotation and drop lines displayed, GyVe easily shows that the presumed filament is actually two disconnected structures. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, bottom panel, shows the same potential filament galaxies (red) projected onto the DEC-cz plane with drop lines to distinguish the two discontinuous components. The drop lines to the DEC-cz plane highlight the separation between the two components in that plane; a projection of a true filament onto any plane would be continuous. As this example shows, GyVe can provide rapid assessment of filament continuity without the cumbersome process of producing several 2D projections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">LESSONS LEARNED: VISUALIZATION</head><p>Throughout the development of GyVe, we incorporated feedback from our collaborators to refine and extend the techniques that were most effective for understanding their data. However, only after our collaborators became accustomed to using GyVe in the course of their investigation were we able to ascertain the usefulness of each visualization technique. In this section, we review the effectiveness of three visualization techniques in our application for achieving the scientific goals: user-controlled interaction, stereo, and torsional rocking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">User-Controlled Interaction</head><p>Prior to GyVe, our collaborators' only experience with 3D visualization of their data took place in an immersive environment where they did not have control over the viewpoint. Because the viewing scale in that experience confined them to being immersed in the data, they quickly became lost. Prior knowledge of the data from 2D slices did not map immediately to the 3D experience because they could not associate large-scale features they had come to know in 2D to the 3D data in which they were immersed.</p><p>User-controlled interaction turns out to be very helpful for keeping our collaborators oriented to the data by giving them control over the viewing scale. They are able to zoom out to get an overview of the data, select a structure of interest, and zoom in to view it at a smaller scale. This is a crucial capability that allows them to understand not only features within the data, but also where those features were located in the larger structure.</p><p>For cases where our collaborators still become lost in the data, they can click a "Home" button that resets the view to the default setting. This allows them to explore their data at different angles and scales without worry of getting lost, knowing that they have a quick way to get back to a familiar vantage point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Stereo</head><p>Stereo helps greatly in understanding the structure of the galaxy and cluster data by showing depth information. For example, stereo is helpful in determining the galaxies bordering voids. Our collaborators found stereo so useful, in fact, that they often walked <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. Snapshot showing the second 6dF survey dataset at a preferred viewing angle to highlight underdense regions. Overdense rims of two void regions, shown in red and green, are selected using GyVe's interactive capability. The arrangement of galaxy clusters, which are represented as orange cylindrical glyphs, confirms prior analysis that the HRS voids are extremely underdense regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>from their offices across campus to use a stereo-enabled system in a graphics lab.</p><p>A drawback that we did not foresee was that stereo makes picking galaxies with the mouse difficult because the cursor appears at different positions in each eye. The right eye must be closed for the cursor to appear in the correct position, but this momentarily breaks the stereo effect. Perhaps a more suitable solution would be to render a 3D cursor controlled by a device with more than two degrees of freedom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Torsional Rocking</head><p>Torsional rocking has two other benefits besides providing structurefrom-motion. The first benefit is that torsional rocking helps in selecting galaxies that border voids. When viewing a void region, two galaxies on opposite sides of the void are often view-aligned, causing one galaxy to occlude the other. With torsional rocking, the galaxy further from the viewer "peeks out" from the closer galaxy, allowing the user to select it and add it to the boundary group.</p><p>The other unforeseen benefit from torsional rocking is that it allows view angle optimization. The user can select a candidate view, turn on torsional rocking to see if there is a better view of the data, and stop the rocking at the better angle. This is particularly helpful when trying to find a single view that illustrates an aspect of the data for a presentation or publication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>GyVe offers several useful features for studying the structure of intercluster galaxies. It has been used successfully by our collaborators to augment other visual and analytical tools. Particularly useful visualization techniques include interactivity, distinct glyphs to distinguish between intercluster galaxies and clusters, labeled axes and curved drop lines, torsional rocking, and stereo.</p><p>Future plans for GyVe include using advanced methods for creating a density field from the galaxy point data and using isosurfaces to locate potential structures. We also plan to experiment with variable-sized sphere probes controlled by a force-feedback device for "feeling around" inside void structures to see how haptic feedback guides intuition about the structures. In addition, we would like to explore image processing techniques for characterizing void structures. Lastly, we intend to add interactive statistical tools for quantifying structural information. <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. Slice from the second 6dF survey (~20 Mpc thick) along the cz coordinate. Top: Potential filament highlighted in red as would be seen in a traditional 2D plot. Bottom: Interactive rotation and curved droplines projecting to the DEC-cz plane quickly show that the structure is not filamentary. Surrounding galaxies not part of the apparent filament have been hidden for clarity.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Primary GyVe display featuring several techniques for visualizing intercluster structure.</figDesc></figure>
