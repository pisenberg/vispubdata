			<abstract>
				<p>The Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN) has developed a science gateway at nanoHUB.org for nanotechnology education and research. Remote users can browse through online seminars and courses, and launch sophisticated nanotechnology simulation tools, all within their web browser. Simulations are supported by a middleware that can route complex jobs to grid supercomputing resources. But what is truly unique about the middleware is the way that it uses hardware accelerated graphics to support both problem setup and result visualization. This paper describes the design and integration of a remote visualization framework into the nanoHUB for interactive visual analytics of nanotechnology simulations. Our services flexibly handle a variety of nanoscience simulations, render them utilizing graphics hardware acceleration in a scalable manner, and deliver them seamlessly through the middleware to the user. Rendering is done only on-demand, as needed, so each graphics hardware unit can simultaneously support many user sessions. Additionally, a novel node distribution scheme further improves our system&apos;s scalability. Our approach is not only efficient but also cost-effective. Only a half-dozen render nodes are anticipated to support hundreds of active tool sessions on the nanoHUB. Moreover, this architecture and visual analytics environment provides capabilities that can serve many areas of scientific simulation and analysis beyond nanotechnology with its ability to interactively analyze and visualize multivariate scalar and vector fields.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Nanoscience is the study of matter at the scale of a nanometer-one billionth of a meter, the scale of atoms and small molecules. Structures and materials at such scale often exhibit unique phenomena and properties fundamentally different from that of macroscopic structures. These properties can be harnessed to make novel devices. Such work is often interdisciplinary in nature, involving molecular biologists, electrical engineers, computer scientists, and others to simulate, optimize, and engineer a working nanoscale device.</p><p>To address these challenges, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has formed the Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN), a network of eight universities with expertise in nanoelectronics, nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), and nanomedical devices. The NCN has created a science gateway for nanotechnology exploration at nanoHUB.org. This web site contains a large collection of online seminars, web-based courses, animations, and other educational materials. All of these resources are coupled with interactive simulations that users can access from any web browser. Its supporting middleware can route simulation jobs to supercomputing resources, including the NSF TeraGrid and the Open Science Grid.</p><p>The nanoHUB is becoming a national resource for the nanotechnology community. Last year, more than 10,000 users viewed online seminars, courses, animations and publications related to nanoscience. Among those users, over 1,800 ran more than 54,000 simulation jobs, consuming over 28,500 solid hours of CPU time.</p><p>Acquiring simulation data is only part of scientific study. Visualization and data analysis serve as the critical pathways to insights and discovery.

In this work, we report our progress in designing and integrating such visualization systems into the nanoHUB architecture, and we show their utility and performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">System Requirements</head><p>Assisting remote users who may not be equipped with sufficient computational resources has become an important and practical aspect of scientific visualization. Such tasks become significantly more difficult for facilities like nanoHUB.org, where visualization systems serve a large number of users whose hardware and software capabilities vary widely, to the extent that only minimal assumptions can be made about their computing profiles. We have identified the following important requirements that direct the design and implementation of our framework:</p><p>1. Transparency: The delivery of hardware acceleration should be seamless and transparent to remote users. The requirements on the user's system should be minimal.</p><p>2. Scalability: Our framework should support many remote user sessions simultaneously. The performance should scale under an increased rendering load as hardware resources are added.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Responsiveness:</head><p>The system should be responsive to user commands even when the number of open visualization sessions is large.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Flexibility:</head><p>The rendering engine should be flexible enough to handle a variety of simulation data, providing capabilities of quickly developing and deploying new tools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Extensibility:</head><p>The system software and hardware architecture should be easily extensible, to satisfy new visualization needs for future applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Related Work</head><p>Most nanoelectronics simulations generate scalar volumes, vector fields or a combination of the two. To deliver interactive visual analytics of a variety of nanoelectronics simulations to remote scientists, our work involves techniques related to molecular dynamics visualization, flow visualization and remote visualization. In this section we will review relevant work separately. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Molecular Dynamics Visualization</head><p>Nanoscale devices frequently consist of molecular structures, and their models often compute scalar fields of molecular dynamics, e.g. electron density, potential and charge density, etc. Published molecular visualization work mainly focuses on two aspects of molecular dynamics: structural information and field properties. For structural information, most published visualization techniques display molecular assemblies with two types of representations: structural rendering and surface rendering. Structural rendering emphasizes the underlying skeletal construction of the molecule, and often displays models using primitives like spheres for atoms and cylinders for bonds (Ball-and-Stick model). Surface rendering mainly presents molecules as space-filling surfaces defined by the van der Waal radii of the atoms or isosurfaces of molecular dynamics properties (e.g., electronic potential). Surface rendering has been adopted by many areas of study, for instance protein-folding <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref> and drug design <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>. Visualization platforms like Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref> and Protein Explorer <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> are examples that handle both structural and surface rendering.</p><p>Volume visualization is quite suitable for rendering scalar dynamics fields. Among volume visualization techniques a popular class is the texture-based volume rendering approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">47]</ref>. Additionally, cell projection approaches are often used for visualizing unstructured meshes (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">38]</ref>). Many nanoHUB simulations are computed on the Cartesian lattice, or an alternative regular lattice called Face Centered Cubic grid (FCC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>. Thus, for scalar visualization, we choose to base our system on texture-based volume rendering. In addition, a convenient and efficient method is available to visualize FCC grid using a set of staggered Cartesian grids <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Flow Visualization</head><p>Vector flow field visualization has been an active research area in recent years. Popular techniques can usually be categorized into two classes: texture synthesis based and particle tracing. Early work in texture synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">45]</ref> has led to various extensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19]</ref> including GPU-accelerated approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">43]</ref>. Texture synthesis techniques are very effective in visualizing 2D vector flow. However, their effectiveness is reduced substantially when visualizing 3D flow fields due to visual cluttering. On the other hand, particle tracing techniques in essence utilize numerical integration schemes to advect particles through the vector field <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>. Recently, particle engines have also been implemented on the GPU where the integration is computed using fragment shaders <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">26]</ref>. Besides point primitives, particle tracing techniques are also able to generate stream ribbons and tubes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">44]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Remote Visualization</head><p>Remote visualization systems are often preferable when the data involved is excessively large to transmit over the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>, or such size is unsuitable to visualize using local workstation and cluster or super computing resources are utilized to accelerate rendering <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20]</ref>. Remote visualization is also helpful in bringing graphics hardware resources to remote users <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">42</ref>, 2] and facilitating distance collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31]</ref>. The motivation of this work incorporates all of the above aspects. Among these systems, VirtualGL [2] and its predecessor <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref> intercept and reroute GLX commands to an X display with hardware-accelerated graphics. The advantage of such an approach is that it requires no modification to the original program and achieves excellent transparency. However, due to the architecture of the nanoHUB, we could not take advantage of VirtualGL (see Section 4.2). In this work, we strive to achieve such transparency using an extremely cost effective approach specifically suited to the nanoHUB software and hardware architecture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">nanoHUB Architecture</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Web-based Interface</head><p>A large part of the nanoHUB popularity comes from a focus on easeof-use. nanoHUB users can launch a simulation simply by clicking a button within their web browser. This brings up an interactive graphical interface, such as the one shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>. This interface appears to be a Java applet running within the browser, but the implementation mechanism behind the scene is much more robust with both simulation and rendering conducted on remote servers. When a simulation is launched, nanoHUB allocates a session on a virtual machine running on a supporting cluster, then sends the image of that session back to the viewer inside the user's web browser via the Virtual Network Computing (VNC) paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref>. The user sees an interactive image of the session which runs remotely on nanoHUB hardware, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure</ref> 1. This unique architecture has a few important advantages. First, because the simulation is hosted on nanoHUB hardware, the state of the simulation is maintained even when the user connection is lost. A user can simply reconnect using web browser to resume his previous simulation session. Second, each session can transparently launch simulations on a vast array of hardware, to which most users would not ordinarily have access. For example, complex jobs can be sent off to other compute clusters on the NCN network, or to other national grids, including the Open Science Grid and the NSF TeraGrid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Visualization Challenges</head><p>There is, however, one disadvantage to the nanoHUB architecture: The graphical environment for each tool runs within a VNC session on cluster nodes that have no graphics hardware acceleration. As a result, visualization of non-trivial simulations (such as the 3D volume shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>) can be very slow. Additionally, the VNC server nodes are rack mounted machines with neither AGP nor PCI Express interfaces to install graphics hardware. Even if graphics cards were installed on the simulation nodes, they would not be directly accessible through nanoHUB's virtual machine layer. A VirtualGL-based solution would require another VNC connection to the machines with hardware acceleration. A VNC-inside-VNC approach is conceptually confusing and difficult to implement, and has prevented us from taking advantage of VirtualGL.</p><p>The use of virtual machines is an important element in the nanoHUB middleware. Virtual machines can be configured independently of the underlying physical machines, so they can be tuned to provide extra security preventing users walled off within one machine from attacking another. They can also authenticate users against a customized Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), so nanoHUB users can be managed separately from users at the institutions supporting nanoHUB. The design and delivery of hardware accelerated remote visualization in the nanoHUB environment should take its unique architecture into consideration and not compromise the advantages mentioned in Section 4.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Hardware-accelerated Remote Visualization</head><p>Our strategy for nanoHUB remote visualization is a client-server architecture. We have created nanoVIS, a visualization engine library that can flexibly handle a variety of nanoscience simulations involving vector flows and multivariate scalar fields. Acting as the server end of the remote visualization, nanoVIS services run on a Linux cluster equipped with hardware acceleration. The render engine has been integrated to NCN's Rappture Toolkit (see Section 5.2.1). The development and deployment of new visualization tools becomes an extremely quick process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Hardware</head><p>Our render farm is composed of a Linux cluster equipped with nVIDIA Geforce 7800GT graphics acceleration. Because our visualization tasks are inherently GPU intensive, CPU speed is not a dominant factor. Thus, modestly configured machines are sufficient, making such a cluster extremely economical to build. Our render nodes are 1.6GHz Pentium 4 with 512MB of RAM running RedHat Linux. The render farm is directly connected with the VNC server cluster. To reduce the network latency that can delay client-server interaction, our render farm is also physically placed in close proximity to the VNC servers. All interconnects in our setup are fast gigabit network as shown the lower portion of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>Utilizing commodity cluster and consumer graphics hardware for render services has several advantages. First, such an approach is extremely cost effective due to the high performance/price ratio offered by modern consumer graphics hardware. As shown in Section 6.3, only a few render nodes are required to serve many remote users. Second, a Linux cluster is flexible to upgrade and expand as needs grow. Our rendering software also facilitates such scalability. Third and foremost, a client-server approach running on cluster PCs integrates tightly into the nanoHUB existing architecture, and such a strategy fits the philosophy of hub-based computing well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Software</head><p>The nanoVIS library and necessary client-server network modules have become an integral part of the Rappture toolkit. This integration has made the development of remote simulation and visualization tools a largely automated process, where code for the GUI client, the server and client-server communication is generated from the user's description of the input parameters and output formats. Thus, the deployment of new tools is greatly expedited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">Rappture Toolkit</head><p>As part of the nanoHUB development, the NCN has created the Rappture Toolkit <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>, the Rapid Application Infrastructure Toolkit, which provides the basic infrastructure for a large class of scientific applications, accelerating the deployment of new tools. Rappture is available as open source, and it includes language bindings for C/C++, Fortran, Matlab, Python, and Tcl, so it is easily integrated into various simulation codes. Instead of inventing their own input/output interfaces, researchers declare the parameters associated with their simulator by describing Rappture objects stored in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) format. Rappture has a variety of input/output objects, ranging from simple elements (such as numbers, choices, Booleans, and text entries) to more complex elements (such as molecules, curves, meshes, and scalar/vector fields). Once a researcher has defined the interface for a tool, Rappture reads the interface description and generates the graphical user interface (GUI) automatically. The tool shown in <ref type="figure">Figure</ref> 2 is an example of graphical interface generated automatically by Rappture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">nanoVIS</head><p>The nanoVIS library, as part of the Rappture Toolkit is also open source. The render engine takes advantage of graphics hardware acceleration and can flexibly handle a variety of nanotechnology simulations computed on Cartesian and FCC grids. For multivariate scalar fields, we choose to base our system on texture-based volume rendering and adopt a multi transfer function approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref> to simultaneously visualize various electromagnetic properties. The isosurfaces of these dynamics fields are also visualized using transfer functions without explicitly generating geometry. In addition, nanoVIS also supports textured cutting planes and geometric primitives which are primarily used to illustrate the simulation geometry.</p><p>For vector field visualization, our engine implements a completely GPU-accelerated particle system similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>. The particle position is governed by the ordinary differential equation (ODE):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∂ x ∂t = v( x(t),t)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Where x(t) is the particle position at time t, and particle tracing amounts to numerically solving Equation 1. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>, we implemented particle advection with fragment shaders using a Eulerian integration scheme:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x n+1 = x n + (t n+1 − t n ) • x n (2)</formula><p>The Framebuffer Object (FBO) feature of OpenGL 2.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref> greatly assisted our implementation. In our implementation, two off-screen FBOs with floating point texture attachments act as source and destination memory. During time step n an FBO storing particle information (position and lifetime) of the previous time step n − 1 acts as the input texture, and the other FBO acts as the output target to which the updated particles are written to using a fragment shader. We then bind the output target FBO as a Vertex Buffer Object (VBO) to render opaque particles. In the next time step n + 1, FBOs are flipped in terms of source and target. Such an implementation requires practically no CPU computation. Particles always stay in the graphics memory and are never transferred through the system bus. Additionally, 2D Line Integral Convolution (LIC) is also integrated into our system to complement the 3D particle advection and illustrate per slice flow field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.3">Client-Server Interaction</head><p>The client side of a simulation and visualization application is composed of a Rappture GUI (see Section 5.2.1) running within a virtual machine. This GUI drives the whole interaction of the tool on nanoHUB as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>. The remote user interacts with the GUI, entering values to set up the problem, and eventually presses the Simulate button. At that point, Rappture substitutes the current value for each input parameter into the XML description, and launches the simulator with this XML description as a driver file. The simulator computes and writes results to files. In scenarios where hardwareaccelerated rendering is not required, Rappture loads the results into the output analyzer for the user to explore.</p><p>As soon as the user selects a simulation result or mode that requires 3D graphics, the Rappture client connects to one of the rendering nodes selected using a node selection algorithm (see Section 6.2). We created a special Linux daemon, nanoSCALE, to monitor a dedicated network port for client communication. When a client connects the communication port, nanoSCALE spawns an instance of our nanoVIS server. Once the socket connection is established, the client and server will synchronize through a network message passing interface.</p><p>As an initial setup step, the client controlling interface sends over one or more scalar and/or vector fields, along with a default camera position. The visualization server loads the data into graphics memory, and then generates and sends back the desired image at the specified camera position. The image coming back from the visualization server is loaded into the GUI running within the VNC session. To save network bandwidth, we utilize a simple run-length encoding method to compress the images. Such a compression scheme is inexpensive to compute using our modest CPUs and works fairly well, since the visualization result typically contains regions of black space. VNC then transmits the screen change to the remote user. To conserve GPU computation resources, the nanoVIS server is designed to quickly deliver rendering upon request and wait for further instructions instead of actively looping and generating the same frame. In the case of particle animation, 20 frames of particle renderings are quickly generated and transmitted to the client side. The interface then plays back this animation without requesting further service. Thus, in our architecture, as long as the user is still, the visualization server is sleeping. This behavior is very important in a hub-based simulation environment, since we need to support not one, but many hundreds, or perhaps someday thousands, of simulation sessions at any given time.</p><p>Various communication commands have been defined in our framework, such as: transfer function, particle seeding, cut plane, zoom, and rotate. Each of these actions will trigger a request to the nanoVIS server, which then updates the view and sends back another image. We use a simple protocol parsed by Tcl interpreters on both ends for most of the communication. For example, the camera can be adjusted by a command such as the following: camera 0.0 45.0 0.0, where the three parameters represent the Euler angles of the camera. Meshes and fields are defined by a similar Tcl-based command, but the actual data is sent and received in binary format, as produced by objects in the Rappture C++ library. So the transmission of control messages is simple and human-readable, but the transmission of data (meshes, fields, and the resulting image) is handled more efficiently. This makes the system easy to debug, while at the same time providing the throughput needed for large datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Performance and Optimization</head><p>As an integral component of the nanoHUB multiuser environment, it is important that the visualization facility should support many user rendering sessions simultaneously. Our nanoVIS engine makes extensive use of GPU acceleration, whereas the CPU is only responsible for network communication and rendering setup (see Section 5.2.3). Thus, the CPU workload is very light compared to that of the GPU. This aspect has allowed us to optimize rendering performance by choosing render hosts based on the GPU workload only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">GPU Load Estimation</head><p>The DirectX9 SDK <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref> exposes various useful graphics hardware performance queries including pipeline timings, pixel timings, etc. The nVIDIA NVPerfKit and NVPerfHUD are also powerful tools to access low-level performance counters. However, these queries and tools are not available on Linux. Therefore, we developed a fairly straightforward GPU workload estimation model for our system based on test data. This model relies on the fact that GPU fragment processing is the dominating factor of performance in our system, and its cost is determined by the number of rasterized fragments and how much computation is required per fragment. However, a complication is the integration of a particle system. Thus, a unified workload measurement is needed.</p><p>It is, in general, difficult to compare the GPU workload of fixedpipeline geometry rendering (particles and simulation geometry) with programmable per-pixel shading (volume visualization). The geometric elements of simulations typically include a few simple primitives for illustration purpose, for instance, computation domain bounding boxes. These primitives are trivial to render compared to the massive amount of particles in our flow visualization. Thus, we only consider the cost of particle rendering in our model. Additionally, our tests have shown that the time required to render the particles is only about a factor of 0.2 of what is required to advect them due to the efficient use of render to vertex array. This enables us to express the GPU workload of the particle system using only the fragment processing cost of the advection step. Now we can develop a unified cost model since the advection shader is comparable to a texture-based volume visualization shader in the way it samples a vector field.</p><p>Our model reflects the fact that the primary cost of the shader execution is texture access, where a particle update requires one texture fetch and a multivariate scalar field may need a few texture samples per fragment. We can query the number of rasterized fragments using the OpenGL ARB occlusion query extension <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>. The workload is computed at each time interval of t. For example, there have been s nanoVIS servers on render host i in the nth time interval. We define the GPU workload L n i of this interval as a function of the total number of rasterized fragments f , the number of visualized scalar fields m, and the number of advected particles p (0, if the particle system is disabled):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">L n i = s ∑ j=1 (2 * ceil( m j 4 ) * f j + (1 + α) * p j )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where α is tunable parameter denoting the cost of particle rendering in relation to advection. To minimize the number of texture fetches, we pack 4 scalar fields into one volume texture. Thus the number of texture accesses for sampling a multivariate volume of m fields is ceil( m j</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Node Selection</head><p>In addition to the estimation model, GPU memory usage is also factored in to prevent graphics memory thrashing. Thus, the best render node choice is one with the least amount of GPU workload that can fit the data sets of the new client. The nanoSCALE daemon resides on each render node and is responsible for monitoring estimated local GPU workload, tracking local graphics memory usage and starting new render services. The nanoSCALE daemon communicates with the started render services through Linux pipes. Whenever a render server receives a render request, it estimates the GPU workload of the current request and pushes the estimate to the local nanoSCALE daemon through its pipe. Additionally, to include a historical bias in the load estimates, the workload at interval w is a decayed sum of the workloads of the previous n intervals with a decay factor of γ, where n and γ are tunable parameters:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L i = w ∑ k=w−n+1 γ (w−k) * L w i (4)</formula><p>The nanoSCALE daemon broadcasts this decayed sum to all peer render nodes. Since the per node workload statistics are made aware to all render nodes, a new client can contact a random render node in the initial step. The initial host subsequently chooses a host with the lightest workload and enough graphics memory to start the render service. The initial host itself is also eligible in this selection. The initial host then updates its record of the target host's load average factoring in this new job. Such an approach keeps the initial host from redirecting to the same target when clients rapidly connect before the next time interval expires. When the target host finally broadcasts its most recent workload, its record at the initial host is updated.</p><p>And finally, a load redirection threshold factor ε is defined to further guide redirection decisions. The initial host with workload average L initial only redirects a task to a target host with workload average L target , if:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">L target &lt; ε * L initial</formula><p>This is needed due to the lag time in the broadcast of workload updates. Different render nodes may have different ideas about the lowest workload. The parameter ε can also be tuned to achieve more accurate redirection. In theory, a client could cycle through several redirections until the load records stabilizes enough for it to settle on a host. However, such an approach would involve many iterations of network communication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Performance</head><p>To measure the performance and scalability of our system, we recorded real user interaction sessions visualizing a 128x128x128 scalar field using the nanoVIS engine in a 512x512 window. The user interaction includes rotation, zoom, transfer function modification, movement of cutting planes and change of lighting/material parameters, each of which causes the engine to re-render the data. A typical user generates bursts of events, where sets of closely spaced events are interlaced with periods of inactivity when the user examines the rendering result. On average, a user initiates less than 5 events per second.</p><p>Based on recorded events, we then simulated a series of simultaneous user visualization sessions. These sessions were started using our node selection scheme in Section 6.2. Our performance metric is the turnaround time, from the time the client issues a command to the time an updated image is received. We measured it on 1, 3 and 5 render nodes to demonstrate how the performance scales as the number of simultaneous render sessions increases. The timing does not include the simulation time, since such computation is not part of the rendering cost. Additionally, our tests are conducted on the nanoHUB production network with competing traffic from users in the same subnet. Thus, the test results are a realistic reflection of our system's performance in the production environment.  As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, the frame times show a favorable sub-linear scaling instead of linear scaling as the number of render sessions increases. This is due to the inherent randomness in the distribution of the user events and their spacing. In other words, the clients rarely request image updates all at the same time. As described in Section 5.2.3, our nanoVIS server is designed to deliver upon request. Thus, the GPU can service the active clients while the others are idle. Such a strategy fits the nanoHUB particularly well, since a typical user will interact with the data generating a series of requests, then examine the results, leaving the client idle for a period of time. As demonstrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>.b, with only 5 render nodes, our system is able to support 100 active sessions at more than 3 frames per second. With a more casual user base we expect to support a much larger number of sessions.</p><p>Our tests also revealed that when the number of clients exceeds 17 on a single node, the 512MB of system memory becomes insufficient and swapping occurs. Thus, the performance become less predictable. However, such problem can be easily solved by installing more system memory. Additionally, even under the severe system memory stress, the performance still degrades gracefully.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Case Studies</head><p>Utilizing our remote simulation and visualization framework, developers successfully created several new nanotechnology tools, SQUALID-2D, Quantum Dot Lab, BioMOCA and Nanowire. More than 1100 user simulation and visualization sessions have been conducted within the very first two weeks of their deployment at nanoHUB.org. In this section we introduce three of these tools. More existing tools are being built to take advantage of nanoVIS graphics hardware acceleration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">2-D Electron Gas Simulator</head><p>A 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) is created by trapping electrons in a very thin quantum well at the boundary between GaAs and Al x Ga 1−x As layers in a semiconductor heterostructure. Quantum de- vices can be created by further constraining electrons in the remaining two dimensions. For instance, by adding electrodes on top of the 2DEG to create potential barriers defining channels, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>. Splitting the path of electrons as they flow down the channel creates an opportunity for interesting quantum interference effects. A magnetic field, for example, can be used to tune the interference of electrons. This is the Aharonov-Bohm effect, which can be used to create many interesting nanodevices <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">23]</ref>. However, even a single impurity within the device is enough to split the flow of electrons, creating unintentional interference effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>. We used a simulator called SQUALID-2D (Semiconductor QUantum AnaLysis Including Dissipation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref> to study such effects in a nanowire with an impurity in the middle of the channel. By varying the strength of the influencing magnetic field, a series of 2D electron flows and electron potential scalar fields are generated. Using the magnetic field as the third dimension, these slices are stacked into a volume, which provides a convenient environment to study the electron properties under different magnetic conditions.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>.a, the particle simulation illustrates the conceptual flow of electrons in the device based on a current density that was computed quantum-mechanically. Near the front of the device, the strong magnetic field causes electron stream to curl and flow around the impurity on either side (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>.b), coupling the edge states as explained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>. Additionally, the electrochemical potential field, which is a measure of the average energy of electrons as they propagate down the channel, can be volume-rendered to further illustrate the strength and spatial features of the energy distribution. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>.c, a sharp drop in electrochemical potential shows areas of resistance within the device as a result of an impurity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">BioMOCA</head><p>BioMOCA simulates the flow of ions through a pore in a cell membrane. This is normally a daunting task in molecular dynamics simulation, but BioMOCA borrows the Monte Carlo technique from traditional semiconductor device simulation and applies it to the biological realm. It computes random walks of ions through a channel with a fixed geometry within a cell membrane. The channel is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> as it appears in the client window. The two vertical planes illustrates the walls of the cell membrane. The cut plane shows a 2dimensional slice with the channel clearly highlighted as the magenta region running from left to right. Users can interactively explore the geometry of the channel by clicking and dragging on the legend as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>.b, to highlight a single isosurface. Each click or drag operation sends a command to the nanoVIS server, which responds instantly with an updated view. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Quantum Dot Lab</head><p>A quantum dot is a tiny chunk of conductor or semiconductor material surrounded on all sides by an insulator. Electrons inside are trapped by the insulator, and if the interior dimensions are small enough (perhaps a few dozen atoms in any direction), the electrons exhibit quantum effects, even at room temperature. Electrons sit in quantized states which resemble the wavefunctions of electrons bound to an atom. Because of this, quantum dots are sometimes referred to as "artificial atoms", and they can be exploited in the same manner as atoms to create lasers and detectors that operate at very specific wavelengths of light <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>.</p><p>The Quantum Dot Lab is based on the NEMO-3D simulator, which can be used to study various configurations of quantum dots <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>. This tool has a graphical interface generated by the Rappture toolkit, letting the user select the size and shape of the quantum dot, the material, the incident light source, and other parameters. Pressing the Simulate button launches a NEMO-3D simulation, which reports the electronic wavefunctions for the various quantized states, along with the absorption spectrum for incident light. Researchers can then tweak the size and shape of the quantum dot to achieve sensitivity to a particular wavelength of light. Visualization of the electronic wavefunction within the volume of the quantum dot is particularly helpful in this analysis. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref> shows s-and p-orbitals for electrons confined within a rectangular quantum dot. We have found visually that a single wavefunction in a highly excited state can have significantly different nodal symmetries for its component orbitals. In this case, it is the s-orbital, rather than the porbital, that has most of its distribution concentrated near the boundary of the quantum dot.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion and Future work</head><p>We have described our remote visualization hardware and client-server software architecture for nanoHUB.org. As an integral component of the nanoHUB, our framework is capable of seamlessly delivering hardware accelerated nanotechnology visualization to remote simulation scientists with only minimal requirements on their computing environments. Our nanoVIS render server incorporates texture-based volume visualization and flow visualization techniques to flexibly handle a variety of nanoscience simulation data. As a component of NCN's Rappture Toolkit, the nanoVIS engine enables rapid development and deployment of new simulation tools. Additionally, we demonstrated that coupled with our GPU load estimation model and render node selection scheme, our approach is both efficient and scalable. Our system design can also be adopted to economically deliver accelerated graphics to other hub-based multi-user environments.</p><p>Future work on our system encompasses several directions. First, a more advanced compression algorithm may help reduce the network bandwidth usage under heavy render requests. Second, the nanoVIS render server can be further optimized to adaptively reduce the rendering quality during rapid user interaction sequences. Such an approach can further enhance our system's interactivity without degrading the user experience. Third, we can extend the nanoVIS engine to handle a richer set of grid topologies including unstructured meshes for finite element simulations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Manuscript received 31 March 2006; accepted 1 August 2006; posted online 6 November 2006.
