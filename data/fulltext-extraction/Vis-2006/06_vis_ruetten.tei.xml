				<p>Topological methods are often used to describe flow structures in fluid dynamics and topological flow field analysis usually relies on the invariants of the associated tensor fields. A visual impression of the local properties of tensor fields is often complex and the search of a suitable technique for achieving this is an ongoing topic in visualization. This paper introduces and assesses a method of representing the topological properties of tensor fields and their respective flow patterns with the use of colors. First, a tensor norm is introduced, which preserves the properties of the tensor and assigns the tensor invariants to values of the RGB color space. Secondly, the RGB colors of the tensor invariants are transferred to corresponding hue values as an alternative color representation. The vectorial tensor invariants field is reduced to a scalar hue field and visualization of iso-surfaces of this hue value field allows us to identify locations with equivalent flow topology. Additionally highlighting by the maximum of the eigenvalue difference field reflects the magnitude of the structural change of the flow. The method is applied on a vortex breakdown flow structure inside a cylinder with a rotating lid.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The topology of the flow field is important in the design of a variety of technical applications. Hence it is important that tensor field visualization techniques are developed to provide significant topological information to designers. In fluid dynamics the velocity gradient tensor, which contains the deformation and rotation information of a fluid element, is the most important second-order tensor. In this paper, focus will be on the velocity gradient tensor, although the presented method is applicable to other second-order tensors in general. The topological flow analysis shows that the three invariants of the velocity gradient tensor provide information regarding the deformation and rotation of fluid elements in a compact way. Hence our focal point is directed to these three invariants which together reflect the principal behavior of the fluid element in the context of the local flow structure. However, the invariants alone do not carry the directional information of the flow pattern and hence it requires information regarding the eigenvectors of the velocity gradient tensor, for the flow field to be be restored. To visualize all the information in an intuitive way remains the ultimate challenge of tensor field visualization.</p><p>A common visualization technique is to reduce the dimensionality of the data: Here we follow this approach by transforming the three dimensional invariant vector into a scalar. The underlying principle of this technique is to use a norm for the invariants which transforms each invariant into an interval from zero to one. Each of the three intervals can now be represented by a color, hence we get a red-green-bluetriplet (RGB), which in principle is also a vector. The next important step is to change the color space. This is achieved by transforming the RGB-values to associated hue values in an associated hue -saturation -lightness (HSL) space, where the saturation and the lightness are predefined. This reduces the color information to a scalar field. Now each local flow pattern is uniquely assigned to a color -hue value and iso-surfaces of colors represent equivalent but not identical flow structures. However, the directional flow information has also to be represented, but visualization of the three principal axes of the local fluid elements at the same time leads to problems with overlapping solution trajectories causing an ambiguity in the perception of the relevant flow information. This is encountered even in advanced icon techniques and it is often solved by decreasing the spatial resolution of the visual representation of the tensor field. We also follow the approach to decrease the dimensionality by concentrating on stream surfaces and slices, which are colored by the hue value of the flow pattern representation. Before we explain our approach in detail, a short overview of related work is given. We then will remind readers of the fundamental aspects of the topological analysis methods in fluids. This is followed by a detailed explanation of our technique. The vortex breakdown dataset, to which we apply our technique, will then be introduced, before we present our results of the application. Open questions will be discussed in the conclusions and suggestions for future work will be given.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>In the development process of technical applications the threedimensionality and time dependency of the flow has to be considered to get optimized and competitive results, and to visualize all significant properties of fluid motion is still a challenging field in flow visualization, especially in the development of techniques to understand flows. Therefore, vector and tensor field visualization is becoming more and more important. Even though several good visualization methods and techniques exist for vector fields, for tensor fields, intuitive and illustrative methods are still missing. In many cases, techniques originally developed for vector fields are transferred to tensor fields, i.e. the calculation of hyper streamlines, introduced by Delmarcelle and Hesselink <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, is similar to streamline calculation, which is a specialization of the general vector line integration. Here, instead of the velocity field, a single eigenvector field is extracted from the associated tensor field and used. Analogously hyper surfaces can be calculated, which consist of hyper streamlines. Other eigenvector information can be visualized in cross sections. Due to visual overlapping and cluttering, only a few cross section can be shown. In the integration process of (hyper) streamlines the problem of choosing appropriate seeding points has to be considered by the user and the correct choice of seeding points depends on his experience. The cluttering, overlapping and seeding point problem reduces the visible information significantly, therefore, most of the global information can not be depicted.</p><p>An alternative way to visualize tensor fields is based on using icons, a technique introduced and well described by de Leeuw et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Advanced icons can illustrate nearly all significant and characteristic information of a local fluid element. Again to avoid cluttering these sophisticated icons can be concurrently used only at a few positions.</p><p>By concentrating on the spatial development of the fluid along certain streamlines or particle traces icons can be placed in locations which gives intuitive insights into the local flow structures.</p><p>Data reduction appears to be necessary to understand the complex properties and nature of vector and tensor fields. One method is to reduce the flow field to its topological structure. By applying topological analysis methods this will result in the flow field to be separated into regions with different flow behavior. The flow field will then consists of degenerate points where the vector information vanishes. These points are connected by separatrices, which are streamlines in 2D or stream-surfaces in 3D, respectively dividing planes (2D) or spaces (3D) into distinct flow regions. The result is a topological flow field skeleton, which can be understood as another form of iconisation. Based on the original work of Helman and Hesselink <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for 2D vector fields, this effective and condensed way to describe and visualize flow pattern has been extended to 3D vector fields. The flow topology classification schemes of Chong <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> for first order critical points can be utilized in many technical applications, see for example the work of Bauer and Peikert <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Higher order critical points were the focal point of the research of Scheuermann <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The connecting streamlines between critical points, i.e. the separatrices, have been considered by Kenwright et. al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Saddle connectors, which in principle are separatrices, are introduced by Theisel and Weinkauf <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. All of this research appear to indicate that the eigenvector and invariant information of the associated tensor field plays the crucial role in visualization of vector fields and topological methods are well integrated in the visualization process of vector fields. The disadvantage is that the reduction of the flow to a skeleton representation makes the flow field discrete and abstract, and therefore less intuitive.</p><p>Using textures can be a promising alternative. In vector field visualization, techniques like the Line Integral Convolution (LIC), introduced by Cabral and Leedom <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, or Spot Noise developed by van Wijk <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> are common methods used to illustrate the flow pattern on bounded or unbounded surfaces. The LIC approach has been adapted to tensor fields by Zeng and Pang <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> applying the technique to anisotropic tensor fields. A more sophisticated approach comes from Hotz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. They concentrated on stress and strain tensor fields of structure mechanics and presented a method to calculate two directional textures, based on the idea, that it is possible to interpret a tensor as a distortion of a flat metric. Therefore, the texture reflects the impact of forces on material. However, even this texture technique has its disadvantage, although the technique is optimal for surfaces, it is suboptimal for volumes, and the perceptional impression is disordered again by visual cluttering.</p><p>Volume rendering techniques with two or more variables can also be a promising method, especially if the flow structure information can be coded by the overlaying of different colors. For example, by applying a criteria for the presence of vortices or shear layers, one gets the required density variables for the rendering process. Tricoche et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> have used this approach to visualize the vortex breakdown phenomenon over delta wings or inside a cylinder.</p><p>Similar to our approach RGB color mapping techniques were introduced by Li and Siegel <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> to visualize stress tensor invariants of earth quake data. Colors were used to show magnitudes of shear stress and deformation of the Lander's earth quake. Another approach utilizing tensor invariants comes from Zhukov et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. To visualize DT-MRI brain data they derived a new invariant from the basic tensor invariants of the anisotropic diffusion tensor which describes the water diffusion in brain tissues. In contrast to our approach they directly extract level-sets from the newly derived invariant field. A more detailed overview and description of various visualization techniques for 3D flow can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">TOPOLOGY METHOD IN FLUIDS</head><p>To satisfy the flow requirements of many fluid dynamic applications, techniques have to be developed to specify the flow behavior in various regions. An alternative design method is to specify structural and temporal development of the flow on sectional planes. In the design process of a fluid dynamic application the practitioner looks at regions with a specified flow behavior based on given criteria which are essential to fulfill the requirements. On the other hand, the structural and temporal development of the flow on slices have to be observed to get information for the evaluation of the design. Here, topology based flow analysis methods are helpful: In a compact and unique manner the main local flow characteristics can be expressed by the invariants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the velocity gradient tensor. Advanced classification schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> can then be used for a more detailed study of the flow topology in the various regions. Normally the topological flow analysis concentrates on critical points and their associated separatrices in the velocity field. A critical point is a point in the field where the vector information vanishes. A Taylor expansion is applied at the critical point and the first and second-order terms in the expansion can be used to reveal the structural information of the flow field. Using the linear term, the critical point can be classified into nodes, saddles, focal points or centers. In figure 1 basic topological elements are depicted. Note that in 3D a flow structure consists of a combination of three topological elements. Trajectories emanating from and to critical points are known as separatrices. In a plane, these trajectories divide the flow field into regions with different flow behavior, which may have different origins and different attractors. Separatrices, which reduce the field to a skeleton in the form of lines and surfaces, demonstrate the effectiveness of the topological analysis. In principle a Taylor series expansion of arbitrary order can be used to study the complete topology of the whole flow field: The origin can be shifted to each point in the flow domain, and the vector of this newly considered point can be subtracted from the entire vector field globally. This creates an artificial critical point, at which the topological analysis can be applied. Hence it is possible to use the topological analysis of the vector field and its associated gradient tensor at every point in the flow domain and it can be shown that this analysis is Galilean invariant. We get a field description for local flow pattern, which at first glance seems to contradict the original idea of the use of topological analysis to reduce field information. Now the calculation of the flow pattern for the entire field enables us to search for equivalent flow patterns in the whole domain.</p><p>Hence, the determination of the local flow field pattern requires the calculation of the three principal invariants P, Q and R of the velocity gradient tensor, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. These three invariants define a three dimensional phase space, in which all flow patterns are determined. The invariant P can be calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P = âTr(grad v) = âS ii = â(Î» 1 + Î» 2 + Î» 3 ) = div v ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>with Î» i are the eigenvalues of the velocity gradient tensor grad v. For a velocity field this corresponds to the negative sum of the principal rate of strain respectively the negative divergence of the velocity. For an incompressible flow P vanishes and the former three dimensional phase space reduces to a two dimensional space. The second invariant consists of the square of the divergence of the velocity and the divergence of the convective part of the acceleration:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Q = 1 2 P 2 â Tr (grad v) 2 = Î» 1 Î» 2 + Î» 2 Î» 3 + Î» 1 Î» 3 = 1 2 (div v) 2 â div a .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The third invariant is given by the determinant of the velocity gradient tensor:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">R = âDet(grad v) = âÎ» 1 Î» 2 Î» 3 = 1 6 (div v) 3 â 1 2 div v â¢ div a â 1 3 S i j S jk S ki â â¦ i j â¦ jk S ki<label>(3)</label></formula><p>This equation also show the relation to the asymmetric parts of the rate of strain tensor S i j and rotation tensor â¦ i j . The equations 2 and 3 reveal that even the invariants are representing more than one local flow property, therefore, the thought to regroup flow properties becomes obvious. However, equivalent flow patterns have the same characteristic tensor invariant information. This means that eigenvalues and eigenvectors have the same characteristics, or more precisely, the same canonical form of the tensor, but they can differ by a scaling factor, and in addition off-diagonal elements in the associated conical matrix will change the observable flow patterns. As a result, to compare flow patterns requires the comparison of normalized tensor invariants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">THE TENSOR LIGHT METHOD</head><p>In order to visualize and compare the flow topology from the tensor invariants we have to avoid visual cluttering. This can be achieved by depicting the result of our three dimensional topological flow analysis as a two dimensional subset, which i.e. means visualization of a surface. Eventually we want to describe a method which allows us to find regions with equivalent flow structures easily. Normally this is done by level sets of a scalar field. Hence, it becomes necessary to transform the three invariants of the tensor into a scalar. Then we can easily extract iso-surfaces where each iso-value stands for characteristic flow patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Normalization of Invariants</head><p>Noting that tensor invariants of equivalent flow pattern can differ by a scaling factor, we have to apply an appropriate normalization which rescales the tensor field without destroying the properties of the tensors. From our vector field we can derive a new vector field:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">v = Î» v ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>without changing the flow pattern. However the Jacobian determinant and the divergence of the scaled field have been changed to</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">det(J Î» v ) = Î» n det(J v )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>with n as the number of dimensions and</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">div(Î» v) = Î» div v .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>A different scaling at each point of the field makes a tensor invariant based comparison of flow structures impossible. This can be avoided by using the normalized Jacobian determinant, which can be defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">â Jnorm ( v) = n det(J v ) â n i=1 â n j=1 ( â v i â x j ) 2 n ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>and the normalized divergence, which we define by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">div norm ( v) = div v n (â n i=1 â n j=1 ( â v i â x j ) 2 ) ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>with n=3 for the three dimensional matrix and n=2 for the corresponding sub-matrix. By applying the normalization in the entire field we get scaling independent values for the normalized determinant and divergence in the range between -1 and 1 for each point, see i.e. the discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Now the equivalent tensor invariants can be calculated as shown below. The term equivalent is used in the sense that instead of considering the original invariants of the tensor which is directly associated to the original vector we calculate new tensor invariants based on the normalization step. The first equivalent invariant is calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P norm = âdiv norm ( v) .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>For the second equivalent invariant we derive</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Q norm = 1 3 â i=1 subâ i,Jnorm ( v)<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where sub denotes to the 2D sub-matrices of the 3D Jacobian. Finally for third equivalent we can write</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">R norm = â Jnorm ( v) ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>which directly results from equ. 7 for n=3. As a result, comparable tensor invariants for each point can hence be computed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">The Color Representation</head><p>The next step is to rescale the three equivalent tensor invariants to a new interval ranging from zero to one:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">[â1, 1] norm â [0, 1] nâscaled .</formula><p>The index n-scaled means normalized and scaled. Henceforth we can assign the three invariants to a RGB-triplet. This is the first color representation of the tensor invariants in a vector form.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">ï£® ï£° P nâscaled Q nâscaled R nâscaled ï£¹ ï£» â ï£® ï£° r g b ï£¹ ï£»<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Our goal is to extract iso-surfaces of characteristic flow behaviors, therefore, we transfer the RGB-triplet into another color space: If we take another color space, i. e. the hue-saturation-lightness (HSL) color space, then the color information itself can be represented by the hue value between a range from zero to one. The transformation of a RGBtriplet to a HSL-triplet is standard in computer graphics <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">ï£® ï£° r g b ï£¹ ï£» â ï£® ï£° h s l ï£¹ ï£»<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Here we used the transformation algorithm of Fishkin <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> to calculate the transformation. Currently in our proposed analysis technique we are concentrating on the hue value, we are not using the correct color representation including saturation or lightness. Therefore, we have to emphasize that this is a very important and crucial point, because now a hue value represents a sub space of the equivalent PQR phase space and not a specific flow pattern uniquely. This sub phase space defines a region of characteristic flow behaviors in which some flow pattern combinations are dominant. This dominant flow pattern combinations are defining the hue. Having this in mind the hue value field can be used as an input for the iso-surface extraction. As result the iso-surface represents locations with the same flow pattern combinations. In fact to represent a single specific flow pattern uniquely means to use saturation and lightness also. Future work will be to derive a more physically motivated transformation by a scalar multiplication of an appropriate transformation vector to the HSL vector in order to show specific flow patterns. Another more sophisticated way could be to transfer the RGB-triplet into a frequency spectrum. The method was first described by Glassner <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, who explains several algorithms to calculate appropriate line or continuous spectra. Even in his approach he orients on the human visual perception which is sensitive to hue values. Although the result would be a more physical representation of the color which also allows to extract iso-frequency surfaces as iso flow behavior surfaces, in this research state we concentrate on the hue value representation of a sub phase space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">The Tensor Light Circle</head><p>If we artificially set the saturation to 1.0 and lightness to 0.5, then we can visualize the flow structures in relation to the color ring, which is a common visual representation of the hue value color space. Each hue value represents a normalized and scaled PQR value combination, which describes dominant flow pattern combinations but not identical flow patterns. This means that these flow pattern can differ in their shape slightly i.e. by a superposed rotational flow or shear, but they can't differ to much in regard to fundamental properties as divergence, rotation or stability. Otherwise the hue would have been changed. Having in mind that our overall goal is to set up a method for the visual comparison of flow patterns, which considers and supports the human perception, we have to explain our assignment of a specific flow pattern to the specific color. However the assignment of a tensor invariants to a specific color is actually arbitrary, because on the one hand the order of the invariants is arbitrary, here, we keep the commonly used "P-Q-R" order, on the other hand a decision for a specific color space is arbitrary. In fact another assignment, i.e. "Q-P-R" would change the resulting hue value but not the grouping of flow patterns. In the case that only one single normalized and scaled invariant is one, we orient towards the 3 basic colors red, green or blue. In the case that two of the invariants are one we assign to yellow, cyan or magenta. In table 1 the assignment is shown. Note that the combination P=Q=R=0 is excluded, because this represents the degenerate case. Even the P=Q=R=1 case is excluded, since it represents a physical inconsistent case of an instable flow but highly rotational and attracting flow field. As mentioned above the presented normalization of the invariants and their transformation into a RGB-triplet includes a rescaling of the values from an interval [-1, 1] to a new interval [0, 1]. This has a big impact on the hue flow pattern representation: For example, in the case of a vanishing Q nâscaled value the non-scaled invariant Q norm has a value of minus one, hence, there must exist a saddle structure. A detailed view on our color assignment to some exemplary three dimensional flow patterns is given in figure 2. Although only a few principal flow structures are depicted, the understanding remains actually difficult. In fact the three-dimensionality of a critical point in regard to its principal flow patterns in its three eigenvector planes causes this problem. Additionally there are different flow patterns with the same canonical tensor, therefore, a appropriate visualization of the principal flow structure especially in 3D is impossible. Here, we see one advantage of our technique: We consciously extend the topological flow pattern visualization to a wider range of flow pattern combinations, so we can identify regions with equivalent flow behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">APPLICATION AND RESULTS</head><p>Before we show the results of our method, we have to explain the numerical dataset, on which we apply our approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">The Numerical Datasets</head><p>We apply our topological analysis method on a numerical dataset of a lid driven internal flow inside a closed cylinder with a height-todiameter ratio of one. The incompressible DLR code Theta 1 was used to carry out the laminar flow simulation. The algorithm for solving the momentum equations is the quadratic upwind differential scheme (QUDS), and the pressure part was solved by a generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) algorithm. The CFD-calculations were performed on a cylindrical grid with 80 points in radial direction and 120 points in circumferential and axial direction. The fixed cylinder wall parts were treated as viscous walls. As boundary condition for the rotating lid on top of the cylinder a solid body rotation was implemented. Unsteady simulations were carried out, starting from a converged steady solution. An initial Reynolds Re = R 2 â¦ Î½ number of 1200 was chosen. The kinematic viscosity was set to a value of 1.4 â¢ 10 â4 m 2 s , which represents an artificial fluid. The starting angular velocity â¦ was set to 0.672 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> s and for a reference length a radius of 0.5 meter was chosen. In a first step the steady flow was calculated until the residue was decreased to a value of 10 â6 . The initial solution for the unsteady calculation represents a stable vortical flow structure. The unsteady flow simulation started with an angular acceleration of 2.24 â¢ 10 â4 1 s 2 and a physical time step of 1 s. Setting these relatively small values provided sufficient relaxation time for a smooth flow structure change. Hence, simulations could be performed in manner that all significant structure changes could be resolved. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> gives a sketch of the behavior of the flow, where the schematic flow structure is illustrated. Yellow bands indicate the primary flow and the red bands represents the secondary vortical flow, which is the focal point of our considerations. Additionally, a LIC texture of the velocity on a meridional section illustrates a vortex breakdown flow structure. With the continuous increasing of the angular velocity of the lid, the parameter conditions for the existence a single vortex breakdown bubble at a Reynolds number of 1450 was reached. Later at a Reynolds number of 1800 the parameter conditions for the existence for two breakdown bubbles was reached. Thereafter, when the Reynolds number exceeded the 2100 the second bubble vanished, and at Reynolds number of 2950 the vortex breakdown phenomenon disappeared completely. More information about the vortex breakdown process of a rotating flow inside a cylinder can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Volume rendering of the genesis of the this vortex breakdown process has be done by Tricoche et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and a phenomenological description is given by RÃ¼tten <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, the flow field with a single vortex breakdown will be considered first to identify the significant flow structure. Then the analysis concentrates on the following cases: the case without a developed vortex breakdown bubble, the case with one, and finally the flow case with two breakdown bubbles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">The Color of the Vortical and Vortex Breakdown Flow Structures</head><p>The dataset describes the vortex breakdown phenomenon of a completely laminar and incompressible flow. Due to incompressibility the topological PQR -phase space reduces to a 2D phase space. At first glance this should simplify the identification of flow structures, but the time dependent dataset contains significantly different flow patterns. A complete understanding of the vortex breakdown phenomenon is still missing. The use of iso-values of the hue value field may be crucial to obtain a better understanding of the vortex breakdown behavior. We look at the vortex breakdown flow structure inside the cylinder flow to firstly identify the most relevant flow structure. Even slices through the flow domain can be used to reveal these significant flow structures. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 4</ref>, planar sections at positions below, through and above the vortex breakdown bubble are shown, where the sheets are hue value coded by hue values of the velocity associated transformed tensor invariants. From the bottom up four orange colored flow patterns are shown on the various slices. An additional flow structure, which resamples a typical four cell flow pattern of an instability mode, can be seen, marked by red arrows. This is an important observation, because it reveals a symmetry breaking in the underlying flow structure. The reason for this, which can give relevant information about the breakdown process, has to be investigated in future work. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">figure 5</ref> the change of the flow structure visualized by the difference of squared eigenvalue magnitudes, where the sign of the real part of the eigenvalues of the velocity gradient tensor is taken into account to reflect the differences of stretching and contraction. Obviously the flow structure change is intense before the breakdown position takes place. At, and above, the height of the bubble, the structure change is significantly smaller. A meridional cut through the cylinder shows this observation clearly, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">figure 6</ref>. At the corners of the rotating lid the flow structure change is comparatively strong, at the cylinder bottom and below the vortex breakdown bubble the flow changes rapidly. Interestingly the conical "orange" flow structure below the lid indicates that the flow adjusts to the lid rotation in such a manner that there the flow change is comparatively small. Below that a similar and smaller conical "orange" flow structure is connected to the vortex breakdown bubble, marked by red arrows. Also in figure 7 a calculated vorticity stream surface, which is color coded by the hue values of the transformed tensor invariants, reveals that the flow below the breakdown bubble changes from a dominant unstable saddle with slight rotation and strong stretching to a dominant vortical flow structure. Furthermore, the four "orange" flow structures can be located again as footprints on the stream surface. Even close to the cylinder lid, where a critical point exists due to the rigid body rotation of the lid, such footprints can be observed.</p><p>The appearance of such significant four cell flow structures in the figures, 4, 6 and 7, suggests to look at an iso-surface of a corresponding orange hue value of the transformed tensor invariants, to identify corresponding 3D flow structures. This orange value will make the dominant vortical and shear flow structure visible, as shown in <ref type="figure">figure 8</ref>. The iso-surface, which is clipped in order to enable us to look at the inner vortical flow, gives an impressive insight of the three-dimensionality of the superimposed additional four cell flow structure. This structure winds around the inner vortex and has an additional conical shape connected to the breakdown bubble, which is indicated by calculated separatrices.</p><p>To compare the time dependent flow we now concentrate on the internal flow around the inner vortex and the vortex breakdown structure. Thus, as mentioned above, further "orange" iso-surfaces are calculated for different flow states. In addition the "orange" iso-surfaces are clipped to exclude the external flow structures. Streamlines or separatrices are calculated to illustrate the vortical flow structure. The results are illustrated in the following figures:</p><p>In figure 9 the vortex has a columnar shape without any vortex breakdown bubble. The view from the top along the vortex axis, which is indicated by the calculated streamlines, shows, that even in the case without a breakdown bubble the additional four cell flow structure is visible. Again this reminds us to instability modes. Although there is not yet a fully developed conical flow structure, which emanates from the vortex axis, it appears that the formation process has already started, because at the height, where the breakdown bubble will occur later on, an "orange-marked"bubble has formed. At the top, a further conical four cell flow structure is forming, and a reversed structure, which is associated to the critical point at the bottom of the cylinder, exists at the lower part of the cylinder.</p><p>In the case of the fully developed vortex breakdown bubble in figure 10 the conical four cell is fully developed. A nearly closed ring has formed around the vortex axis and slightly above the breakdown bubble. As also observed in the meridional cut, the conical flow structure extends from the ring and is corrected to the vortex breakdown bubble. Interestingly the higher four cell conical structure has grown, and furthermore, it is slightly twisted relative to the lower structure.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 11</ref> the case of the two fully developed breakdown bubbles is depicted. Analogously to the one bubble case we can again identify the four cell regions. This time, for each breakdown bubble, an associated conical rotational and shear flow structure is formed. Moreover, above the bubbles the conical flow structure associated to the rotating lid more becomes more and more distinct and dominant, whereas the reversed flow structure at the cylinder bottom becomes weaker. A further detailed view into the flow structures is given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 12</ref>. Additionally the later state of the evolution of the flow structure is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 13</ref>, when the second bubble has been collapsed. Now the upper conical flow structures dominates the flow field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We have presented a new approach to visualize topological flow patterns. By introducing a color representation of normalized and scaled tensor invariants we were able to investigate the flow structure of the vortex breakdown process of a time dependent flow inside a cylinder. We could identify significant vortical and shear flows, which are similar to the four cell flow structures of instability modes. Furthermore, in our application we also showed the direct relationship of these identified flow patterns to the occurrence of vortex breakdown bubbles. This new insight will be useful for further investigation of the vortex breakdown phenomenon.</p><p>Although we have presented a new way of topology flow visualization the detected flow structures remain slightly abstract. Here, an interactive visualization tool for illustrating single flow structures <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>. Iso-surface of an orange hue value of the transformed tensor invariants, additionally visualized separatrices corresponding to an arbitrary position in the PQR phase space would be desirable and would support the further understanding of the flow physics. It has been possible to have further new insights into the vortex breakdown by application of our technique. However at present our approach has some weaknesses: the transformation from RGB to HSL color space has been motivated by the preserving of color and is not completely physically motivated. Therefore, the direct link to the properties of the PQR phase space is not obvious. This aspect has to be addressed in the further development of the present method, i.e. by defining color directly in the phase space. <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>.
