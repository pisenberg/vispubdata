			<abstract>
				<p>A method for the semi-automatic detection and visualization of defects in models of nematic liquid crystals (NLCs) is introduced; this method is suitable for unstructured models, a previously unsolved problem. The detected defects-also known as disclinations-are regions were the alignment of the liquid crystal rapidly changes over space; these defects play a large role in the physical behavior of the NLC substrate. Defect detection is based upon a measure of total angular change of crystal orientation (the director) over a node neighborhood via the use of a nearest neighbor path. Visualizations based upon the detection algorithm clearly identifies complete defect regions as opposed to incomplete visual descriptions provided by cutting-plane and isosurface approaches. The introduced techniques are currently in use by scientists studying the dynamics of defect change.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Liquid crystal is an intermediate state of matter that exist between the solid (crystal) and liquid state under specific conditions for certain organic materials. In this state, molecules have lost most of their positional order, but retain some orientational order. Changes in the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules are important in understanding the physics of liquid crystal dynamics; rapid changes in orientation over space create defect structures that are of interest to physicists. Thus, the detection and visualization of these defects is needed for computational studies of liquid crystals. In this work, we present a defect detection algorithm for unstructured models of liquid crystals, specifically nematic liquid crystals (NLCs), to assist in the visual analysis of NLC behavior.</p><p>Nematic liquid crystals have been the focus of major research due to their high sensitivity to external magnetic or electric fields. Even the presence of a weak field created due to intra-molecular forces can cause major structural changes in nematic material. These changes are manifested as a defect structure. Recent advances in the computer simulation and nano-fabrication process of NLC's has created an interest in the application of NLCs as a simple and cost-effective sensor platform design. Our collaborators are studying the use of NLCs as a biosensor <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and our work was designed to enhance their visual analysis of defect dynamics.</p><p>The study of disclination cores is done using the director or the scalar order parameter. The director represents the preferred orientation of a group of molecules, and is represented by a vector n. The scalar order parameter S represents the orientational order of a liquid crystal, and is a statistical average of a molecule's deviation from the director computed over a small collection of molecules (macromolecule):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S = 1 2 3 cos 2 θ − 1</formula><p>Typical values of S range from 0.3 to 0.9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, depending on the temperature, where θ is an angle between a molecular orientation and the director. Our proposed technique uses director based analysis; validation is done using scalar order and director based analysis conducted by our experts collaborators. In general, defect cores are the regions where the director's gradient is very high and the local scalar order parameter deviates significantly from the average value. Defects occur as points (zerodimensional), lines (one-dimensional), or walls (two-dimensional) in three-dimensional space. Among these, wall defects are not topologically stable; for example, a wall defect will degenerate into lower dimensional defects having low molecular interaction energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Our technique uses the measure of director change around a node for classification and has successfully performed detection of defects. This technique addresses the previously unsolved problem of defect detection in 3D unstructured grids. We present the details about disclinations in Section 2, and various existing approaches for disclination study and visualization are reviewed in Section 3. We present our defect detection model, the algorithm, and simulation details in Section 4. Visualization results and comparative analysis is presented in Section 5, followed by future outlook and conclusions in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">NLC DISCLINATION</head><p>A typical sample of nematic material does not have a director oriented uniformly at all points in the sample. It is common to find the director in certain regions pointing in one direction, while pointing in a different direction elsewhere. If there is overlap between these regions, then the director orientation changes abruptly. Such a change exhibits discontinuity in an orientation profile (i.e., it possesses a disrupted director field n (r)) and is classified as a defect. The study of these defects is very important in understanding the response of nematic material under different conditions or in the presence of external molecules. Various experimental and computational studies of nematic medium have confirmed the existence of such defects <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</p><p>The term disclination was coined by Frank <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and comes from the Greek word kline, meaning slope. The term is used to describe line defects, as a line represents a discontinuity in the inclination of the director. Different studies have indicated that line defects are most common, followed by point and plane defects <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Disclinations are further classified on the basis of the total angular change of the director in the plane perpendicular to the disclination line. The total change of director orientation is defined as 2πm, where m is the strength of disclination (often called Frank's number) which can take the value of 0, ± <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> 2 , ±1, ± 3 2 , ±2 . . . <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows a disclination of index +1 as the director rotates by nearly 180 • about the defect core. We use a measure of the total angular change of the director to detect defects.</p><p>In our study, we use an unstructured grid to model the biosensor along with suspended particles of various shapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Our proposed method produces effective and less cluttered visualization by depict-  ing only defect nodes. In addition, it finds regions missed by other methods, such as isosurfacing. Details are discussed in Section 4 with the study of algorithms effectiveness in Section 5. The application tool developed on the basis of the proposed algorithm has successfully been used by scientists to explore defects in 3D unstructured models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RELATED WORK</head><p>Previously, research by the liquid crystal community has been empirical in nature, utilizing optical instruments for visualization and analysis. This is changing due to the increasing application of computational simulation and modeling. This increased computational focus has resulted in NLC-specific visualization research <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. In this section, we discuss the current state of automatic defect detection and visualization for NLC's.</p><p>One of the first 3D disclination methods was introduced by Toyoki <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>; his approach uses homotopy-based defect classification to understand the evolution of disclinations over time. Homotopybased disclination classification means that the path or loop traced by the director can be continuously deformed into a point or a path joining diametrically opposite points as shown in Toyoki's classification of defects involves marking each face of a cube in lattice where the total angular rotation of the directors calculated at each corner of a cell is approximately equal to 180 • (π). Only the minimum angle subtended between a pair of directors is considered, as the director is a headless vector (n and −n are equivalent). This technique was successfully used to study time evolution of disclination lines in a structured nematic model. Zapotocky et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> later presented a defect detection algorithm and complete classification scheme similar to Toyoki's but focused on finding point defects in a two-dimensional (thin slab) nematic substances. Multiple algorithms are used depending the type of defect and nematic medium. For each algorithm, defect detection involves computing the total angular rotation of the director by stepping around a set of 2x2 or 4x4 blocks as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>; a defect is classified as stable or unstable depending on whether the total rotation is an odd or even multiple of π.</p><p>Another similar technique was proposed by Hobdell and Windel <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> by extending Zapotoky's approach to structured three dimensional grids. This extension involves repeating the two dimensional approach along each coordinate axis so that each face of a collection of cells is searched for disclinations and marked accordingly. Once all cells are classified, marked cells are sorted to form continuous lines. Line direction is found by forming a vector from one cell to its next cell ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). Multiple algorithms were used to detect defects of different strengths; for example detecting whether the director changes its orientation by 180 • or 360 • . Furthermore, differentiation of identified lines is done by finding the characteristic angle of the disclination α; α is the angle between the rotation vector Ω (the vector around which director seems to rotate) and the disclination line L.</p><p>In contrast to performing defect visualization in simulated datasets, Sparavigna et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> developed an image based approach for analyzing polarized light microscopy data via Oriented LIC and streamline techniques. The defect pattern is detected by performing 2D analysis of the director field near defects in the acquired images. This technique <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. All sets of cells formed by 2x2 blocks are checked using the algorithm described by Zapotocky et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> To find disclinations as shown. In the left image, the director is shown as a nail with a rotation vector (Ω) pointing out of the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The right image shows line creation for identified nodes, A, B and C with line direction indicated by L at node B.</p><p>highlights the defect pattern but fails to provide any local orientation or defect structure information. Recently, Slavin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> used various visualization techniques such as streamlines <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, streamtubes, and ellipsoids for nematic field visualization in a virtual environment. Various immersive and interactive techniques helped in reducing visual clutter to a certain extent, but the use of streamline introduces sampling and placement issues. The streamlines were placed using anisotropic metrics; the researchers anticipated better results using Westin's metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The researchers noted that although virtual reality was a good environment for molecular exploration, it showed limitations in displaying clear structures and patterns in the context of nematic topological defects <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Sameep et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> have studied defect structures occuring in regular silicon lattices using isosurfacing, volume rendering, and classification based upon atomic bond angle (local operators). They demonstrated that local operator based methods are simpler and as effective as other approaches based on their analysis of a regular lattice grid of size 112x112x112.</p><p>Aside from existing NLC research, we would like to clarify that techniques developed for the detection of crest and valley lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref> or methods for the simplification of vector field topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> are not well-suited to our problem. Detecting crest lines or ridges involves the study of surface normals and derivatives for estimating line curvature on the model surface. In contrast, detection of NLC defects requires extraction of defect or fracture lines (disclinations) embedded in 3D models. The study of flow field topology involves analysis of critical points (positions in a vector field where field magnitude is zero), but disclinations are not based on critical points. Defect cores in NLC are defined on the basis of the director change. In fact, Q-tensor based defect analysis is the study of a tensor representation of n and S; this Q-tensor field does not possess any critical points or points that have zero magnitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</p><p>All of the techniques discussed above have limitations which make them unsuitable for our problem. These techniques solve the problem in a low dimension space or rely on a user for visual detection. Moreover, there does not exist any known technique for higher precision 3D unstructured data. Increased precision in computation through the use of an adaptive mesh refinement topology has been discussed in depth by Fukuda et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. Their study demonstrated that use of a finer grid notably enhances defect detection. Hence, our research focuses on exploring unstructured grids for simulation modeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">NLC DEFECT DETECTION ON UNSTRUCTURED GRID</head><p>For defect detection, our algorithm (Algorithm 4.1) visits each node of the input grid and identifies it as a defect based on the total director rotation and user supplied threshold angles. Node identification is a two step process. In the first step, a node connectivity list is built for the current node; in the second step, the total angular rotation of the director (Θ) is computed by traversing each node of the sorted list. Visited nodes are classified as a defect if the total rotation is within the threshold limits. Threshold limits consist of user supplied minimum (α 1 ) and maximum (α 2 ) angles. Our collaborators have used threshold values for indirect defect classification or filtering.</p><p>The angular rotation of the director between two nodes is defined by the minimum angle between them. Since a director defines some preferred molecular alignment, we make no distinction between the director's direction; n and −n are equivalent ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>). Here, A and B denote two macro-molecular structures with associated directors. The director rotation between A and B is computed by taking the dot product of two directors and considering only the smaller angle (α 2 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>). Computing total angular rotation (Θ) requires node traversal in a certain order. Orderless traversal, based on only grid connectivity, would result in an incorrect Θ as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>. Here, the node being classified (central node) is shown along with its neighbors. The total angular rotation of the director involves ordered traversal through all neighbors. The effect of unordered traversal and ordered traversal is shown by considering three nodes a, b and c ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>). In an ordered traversal ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>: top-right), θ is computed for node pairs (a, b) and (b, c) as θ = α + β . In the case of an unordered traversal, the node pairs are (a, c) and (b, c), resulting in θ = α + β . Here, θ is incorrect and greater than θ , the correct angular separation for nodes A and B. Hence, it is critical to define an ordering in 3D space when computing Θ; we use a nearest neighbor path. Nearest neighbor paths (NNP) are widely used to structure explorations for data query, pattern matching, and searching <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. We have used an NNP to constrain and define our node traversal order. Finding the NNP results in an ordered, nearly spiral path in the randomly scattered neighbors as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref>. The Θ computation in 3D space is done on this spiral path, since using a projection method <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> or random walk gives incorrect results. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref> shows the central node with all its neighbors in both NNP sorted and an unsorted sequence. Using the unsorted sequence results in an incorrect identification due to the higher random fluctuations in director deviation.</p><p>To perform detection of defects, we first preprocess the input grid and generate node connectivity lists with NNP sorted neighbors. Most mesh generating tools create separate grid topology and solution data. Thus, we build the required NNP sorted neighbor list (NNPList) in a preprocessing stage. The steps for building the NNPList involve reading the grid topology file, building the node-to-node connectivity lists (N2NList), and then, for each node, sorting its neighbor list by using a greedy nearest neighbor path approach. In greedy NNP, we first create an empty NNP list and use the N2NList as an input list. In the first step, we insert the first node from the N2NList into NNPList; we continue inserting nodes from the N2NList which are closest to the last node inserted until no nodes are left. NNP-based sorting creates an effective winding path for neighboring nodes for a tetrahedron-based grid.</p><p>After the preprocessing step is done, the solution data corresponding to the required timestep is loaded. Then, a defect list is generated by visiting each node and classifying it on the basis of Θ and some threshold angles. Complete algorithm details are listed below. end if 10: end for 11: return defectList</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">VISUALIZATION AND RESULTS</head><p>The NLC defect detection algorithm discussed in this paper has been implemented in a prototype application used by scientists. The application was developed using C++, OpenGL, HDF5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and wxWidgets <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Testing was done using a Dell Dimension 8400 system with a 3.2GHz processor, 1GB RAM, and an NVIDIA 6800 Ultra graphics card with 256MB video memory.</p><p>In simulation models, the orientation profile of nematic material is described by a time-evolution equation simulating short and longrange elastic effects. The simulation data was obtained by the numerical integration of the Beris-Edwards formulation on an unstructured grid model <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>; this data was generated by our collaborators. The normal simulation cycle takes a number of timesteps to converge or reach a stable state, with each timestep generating solution files in HDF5 format containing S and n parameter values computed at each node.</p><p>Our NLC defect detection tool (NLCViz) has been developed as an object-oriented and scalable 3D defect detection system. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref> shows a snapshot of NLCViz; the tool has proved useful to our collaborators in defect exploration and analysis. Users can interactively visualize defect nodes with associated director; node connectivity and model boundaries can also be displayed. The visual results presented here are shown to demonstrate the correctness of our algorithm, and we expect that our approach would benefit the liquid crystal community in general by making defect dynamics studies in 3D unstructured grid feasible and effective. Our visualization of defects currently uses a sphere at each defect node colored by a property of the node (director orientation, scalar order value, etc.); the director may also be depicted with line through the sphere. This simple visualization is used to indicate the location of the defect and provide a sense of the extent of the defect region. In the future, extent regions could be depicted using region growing algorithms or glyphs could be used to visualize the complete physical information contained at each defect point <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Case Studies</head><p>To validate the correctness of our defect detection approach, three cases studies were performed. In each case, the defects extracted using our algorithm were visualized and compared against the defects determined using the visual-based workflow used by our collaborators. Their workflow consists of sweeping an isosurface through the scalar order parameter S field of the data or using cutting planes colored by S; as previously mentioned, values of S significantly different from the average usually indicate a defect. Note, our collaborators use a visual-based approach for detect identification because a robust defect detection algorithm did not exist for unstructured NLC models; this was one of the motivations of our work. The case studies demonstrate that our defect detection is valid for the previously solved structured grid case (first case study), that our approach correctly identifies defects over time (second study), and that our method can be applied to complex models (third study). These different studies are based upon the actual tasks performed by our collaborators, who are studying an NLC-based biosensor model. These collaborators performed the validation of our results; they also provided the datasets used for study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Structured Case: Cube</head><p>In order to demonstrate that our technique is applicable to structured domains, we explored the defects of a synthetic dataset of a cube. In this model, two disclination lines were created for algorithm validation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref> shows the images created using FieldView and our tool. The left-hand side image was created using FieldView, where the defect structure is shown as an isosurface (blue color) along with the sectional slice from the y-z plane. The right-hand image shows results generated using our algorithm, where the extracted region shows a close resemblance to the marked region. Each extracted defect node is shown as a sphere along with its director.</p><p>The defect regions detected by our algorithm and via the isosurfacing method overlap; the isosurface defect region is smaller due to the discrete S value used by the isosurface algorithm (more on this later). This case demonstrates that our approach is still valid for regular grids; this is important since most NLC computational studies have been on such grids. Our proposed algorithm has potential to detect defects in any grid topology, provided the required node-to-node connectivity information can be built from the input grid definition. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Unstructured case: Disclination Annihilation</head><p>The second case study demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach on unstructured NLC models. The dataset used for this study is similar to the one discussed by Grollau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>; it consist of a sphere embedded in an NLC substrate. Our collaborators have used this dataset for comparison and validation of their unstructured grid based simulation model. In this study, two disclination lines are created at a distance from a central sphere; the defects move slowly toward each other due to strong attractive force and finally annihilate each other, creating a Saturn-ring type defect around the sphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The computational model used in this study has been modeled with high grid resolution, consisting of nearly 72,000 volume tetrahedrons. Finer resolution has been used near the sphere for more precise and stable numerical results.</p><p>A comparison study showed that the defect regions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>) marked by our collaborators using an isosurface has strong resemblance to the regions identified by our algorithm <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 11</ref>). Figure 10 and 11 depict four distinct timesteps from the defect evolution sequence. In the first timestep, two disclination lines are equidistant from the sphere and a ring defect surrounds the sphere, both of which are clearly identified with our algorithm <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 11a</ref>). Note that, unlike the isosurface-based approach, our defect region correctly entirely encloses the sphere. In the second depicted time step, the disclination lines move closer to each other while the ring structure starts to change. This is clearly visible in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11b</ref>, but not so clearly in the reference image <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 10b</ref>). In the reference image, the correct defect region is not the isosurface region but the darker region visible within it. This ambiguity is introduced because an isosurface is created for a distinct S value and suffers from numerical precision issues; in addition, the defect structure may span a range of S values. In our approach, defects are identified based on the director change and hence are clearly identified. Finally, the last two time steps show the annihilation of the disclination lines; this is visible in both figures. Once again, however, the fine structure of the defect region is only visible using our approach <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 11c</ref>) due to the discrete behavior of the isosurface-the isosurface either encompasses too large an area (as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10c</ref>) or too small an area (not pictured).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3">Unstructured case: A Protein Molecule</head><p>To validate the correctness of our algorithm for complex geometry, our collaborators designed a protein molecule dataset with a very fine mesh consisting of nearly 784,700 volume tetrahedrons; the model is   of Immunoglobulin G, an antibody. Due to the complex shape of a protein molecule, it is not possible to study defect structure using only 2D sectional views as was done for the symmetric models previously. In order to capture the defects around the curves and valleys of a molecular surface, the volume near the protein surface has been modeled with very fine mesh topology. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> shows the defect region identified using FieldView based on S value analysis (upper) and our method (lower). For this model, sectional views do not provide any relevant information and isosurface extraction proved to be very difficult task: A very small change in the visualized S value will distort the depicted region considerably. Our method does not suffer from this limitation. We can identify all the lumps and curves visible in the isosurface; moreover, our defect region is continuous. In addition, since our approach is based directly on the node values, no interpolation or sampling is involved, unlike the isosurface approach.</p><p>Comparative analysis of the above three case studies shows that our defect identification method, based on the director change, is more stable and robust than the single-value, S-based methods previously used by our collaborators. In the presence of a complex 3D surface, creating an appropriate sectional views and isosurface from a specific S value is a complex task-one that still may not depict the entire defect core. Our semi-automated approach simplifies the defect discovery process; the only parameters that needed to modified are the threshold of angles used to classify the defect; the defaults of angles around 180 • were sufficient in the cases above. Finally, as demonstrated above, the defect regions discovered can span multiple S values and individually resolve nearby defects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">User Feedback</head><p>Our collaborators found the prototype to be very beneficial in their analysis, particularly for the biosensor design work. In biosensor design, locating and understanding defects is the most critical task. The commercial tools (FieldView and TecPlot) used by our users are not designed for performing defect extraction and identification; thus, they require a lot more effort. As mentioned, significant time is spent in determining correct sectional views, selecting an S value for isosurfacing, and creating 2D plots of various parameters. Our tool helped by focusing more on the analysis work rather than on manipulating different parameters and thus reducing overall defect detection time. This also made the analysis process easier and directed the research effort towards the study of defect dynamics, rather than finding those defects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We have proposed a new approach for detecting NLC disclinations in unstructured data without performing sampling or simplification of data. Our proposed approach identifies the actual defect core and disclination without creating any visual clutter. Moreover, this technique is based on existing research for detection of defects and identifies defects in structured and unstructured grids. Finally, unlike methods based upon isosurfacing of the scalar order parameter, the detected defect regions are continuous and can possess fine detail.</p><p>Our future research will focus on finding a classification scheme that can identify the nature of different defects; this identification is currently accomplished visually. The current understanding of defect structures in unstructured space containing complex shapes is not well understood; traditional classification methods are not sufficient.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Comparison of an automatic defect detection and traditional approach used in the design of an NLC based biosensor.
