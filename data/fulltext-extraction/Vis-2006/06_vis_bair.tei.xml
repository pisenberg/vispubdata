			<abstract>
				<p>This paper is a contribution to the literature on perceptually optimal visualizations of layered three-dimensional surfaces. Specifically, we develop guidelines for generating texture patterns, which, when tiled on two overlapped surfaces, minimize confusion in depth-discrimination and maximize the ability to localize distinct features. We design a parameterized texture space and explore this texture space using a &quot;human in the loop&quot; experimental approach. Subjects are asked to rate their ability to identify Gaussian bumps on both upper and lower surfaces of noisy terrain fields. Their ratings direct a genetic algorithm, which selectively searches the texture parameter space to find fruitful areas. Data collected from these experiments are analyzed to determine what combinations of parameters work well and to develop texture generation guidelines. Data analysis methods include ANOVA, linear discriminant analysis, decision trees, and parallel coordinates. To confirm the guidelines, we conduct a post-analysis experiment, where subjects rate textures following our guidelines against textures violating the guidelines. Across all subjects, textures following the guidelines consistently produce high rated textures on an absolute scale, and are rated higher than those that did not follow the guidelines.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Among the many challenges to visualization design is the seemingly simple and ubiquitous problem of the simultaneous viewing of overlapping three-dimensional surfaces. This is a common scenario in such applications as medical visualization of tissue layers, geographic visualization of geological layers, multi-phase flow visualization, and in many applications involving the use of isosurfaces. The usual method for viewing such surfaces is to use transparency and color coding, but in such visualizations it is often difficult to discriminate details on both surfaces. It is well known that providing both stereoscopic and motion cues can greatly aid in depth discrimination but, when multiple surfaces are presented, even these cues can become confused. Unfortunately, it is quite difficult for the visual system to maintain the perception of overlapping continuous surfaces, separated in space, when viewing them projected on a flat display. We would like to be able to make it easier for the radiologist to identify pathological tissue or for the geologist to identify subsurface anomalies. Here, seeing the shapes of individual surface features and the relationships among features is essential to understanding the data. Therefore, an important question is, what perceptual cues will minimize confusion while maximizing the ability to spatially localize surface features?</p><p>In this paper we experimentally determine a set of guidelines for the texturing of two overlapping surfaces in three-dimensional space, which minimize visual confusion while maximizing the ability to locate distinct features. We create viewing conditions that are excellent for discriminating depth by using a very high resolution Wheatstone stereoscope and by rocking the display projection to give additional cues to depth. Even with these good viewing conditions, perceptual confusion is usual but can be greatly reduced by texture choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PREVIOUS WORK</head><p>There have been a number of parametric studies of the perception of single curved surfaces under stereo viewing conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</p><p>Others have investigated the ways in which textures can be used to enhance shape perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Notably, Ware and Frank <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> demonstrated the enhancement to three-dimensional viewing on a flat screen that is obtained by combining both stereo-disparity and motion-parallax cues to depth. There has also been significant work done on the layering of multiple scalar, vector, tensor and motion fields in two-dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. However, there has been little study of the problem of simultaneous viewing of layered surfaces, the notable exception being Interrante et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, who showed that providing texture cues enhances the ability to understand layered shapes.</p><p>In more recent papers, House and Ware <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and House et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> laid out a "human in the loop" methodology for experimentally exploring visualization parameter spaces. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1a</ref> schematically outlines their process, whose key elements are 1) an experimental search of parameter space to produce a database of rated solutions, and 2) mining of this database to develop and evaluate guidelines for producing optimal visualizations. In these papers they use, as their example, the problem of optimally texturing smoothly varying layered three-dimensional surfaces like those shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1b</ref>. Bair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> focuses on the analysis of these experimental results, and presents a set of guidelines for producing such optimal textures. This work was an important first step in developing this new experimental methodology. However, the construction of their layered surface test case had several limitations. This paper builds on their previous work, aiming to make a more rigorously grounded contribution to the literature on layered surface viewing.</p><p>The work being reported here redesigns this earlier experiment, addressing each of these issues. In addition, it introduces the use of a very high-resolution stereo display and an important speedup to the genetic algorithm used to control the "human in the loop" parameter space search.</p><p>â€¢ Alethea S. <ref type="bibr">Bair</ref>    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN</head><p>We attempted to simulate surface shapes that had characteristics that might be found in a real application using layered surfaces. Instead of using fixed smooth surfaces, we construct new surfaces for each presentation with broad spatial frequency content. The surface generation algorithm superimposes seven symmetric Gaussian bumps of varying size on a sinusoidally generated noisy background height field. The bumps represent the significant features that a scientist might be looking for on a specific surface, while the background height field serves as a distracter. The surfaces are randomized so that an experimental subject cannot 'learn' the terrain or guess where the bumps will be. The top surface has a variable degree of transparency, and the bottom surface is opaque. The surfaces are textured with colored marks randomly generated for each presentation by the parametric method described below. The lighting model uses a standard Lambertian shader with a 30% ambient term, and the scene is lit from the above right. The viewpoint is rocked from side to side to provide depth-from-motion cues, and the display is presented on a high-resolution stereoscope to provide stereo depth cues. Before beginning the experiment, a subject's ability to discern depth from stereo was verified by asking them to make depth judgments based on two random-dot stereograms. All subjects were able to perform this test correctly. The subject was then shown an example pair of surfaces textured with a texture set known to be of 'average' quality in permitting discernment of the two surfaces, and was given the chance to see each surface shown individually.</p><p>During the experiment, the subject was shown a textured layeredsurface presentation and asked to rate their ability to locate all seven bumps on the bottom surface and on then on the top surface. Ratings were from 0 to 9, requiring only a single key numeric key press on a standard keyboard. After the two ratings were entered, the next presentation was made and the process repeated. A genetic algorithm controlled the generation of new textures for the surfaces based on the subject's ratings, so that the texture parameter space tended to be searched most heavily in areas of high quality. After completing at least two generations of the genetic algorithm, the subject was requested to look for an exceptionally good presentation and could initiate creation of an "island" population to be more closely inspected. Once the island population was rated, the experimental trial was ended.</p><p>For our trials we utilized six subjects, completing 22 total trials, resulting in 4560 rated texture pairs. Subjects were all familiar with computer graphics applications, so in that sense they could be considered experts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.1</head><p>Surface generation The background height field for each surface is generated on an (x, y) Cartesian plane, as the product of the sum of eight sinusoids that vary in the x direction and the sum of eight sinusoids that vary in the y direction. The longest period sinusoid is about 12 degrees of visual angle (two cycles per display width on our display), and the remaining sinusoids have periods dropping off with the ratio 0.6. Thus, the shortest period sinusoid is about 0.3 degrees of visual angle (72 cycles per display width). Each sinusoid is given a random phase angle between Ï€/2 and -Ï€/2, and amplitudes scale linearly with the period but with a 20% random variation. Seven Gaussian bumps of various sizes are arranged in a jittered pattern on this plane, ranging in standard deviation from about 2 degrees of visual angle (1/12th of the full display width), to 1/2 degree of visual angle (1/48th the width). The ratio of bump sizes is 0.8. The largest bump is similar in height to the product of the largest sinusoid amplitudes, and bump heights fall off linearly with standard deviation. Example top and bottom surfaces are shown <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The variation in terrain shape and in bump size and placement is apparent. Note also that the radial symmetry of the bumps helps to distinguish them from the noisy background, which is anisotropic, having strong horizontals and verticals.</p><p>top bottom <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Example surfaces used in the experimental display.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Texture generation</head><p>We designed our parameterized texture generation approach to be able to create a wide space of different patterns, so that findings would be generalizable, but simple enough to learn something from the results. All parameters have seven discrete levels ranging from 0 to 6. For example, the background grey color ranges in luminance from black at 0 to white at 6. Although Interrante et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> showed that adding texture to the top surface of a layered display provides important shape information; they produced no statistically significant evidence that building such textures to conform to the surface improves the display. Consequently, for our work we construct simple tiled, draped textures. A texture tile is a 512x512 image, consisting of a grey background covered with colored marks. In the presentation, each tile covered about 3 degrees of visual angle. A parameter controls overall texture rotation, which ranges from 0Â°t o 90Â° in steps of 12.8Â°. The top surface texture background ranges from fully opaque to fully transparent (the bottom surface background is always opaque). The background grey color ranges in luminance from black to white. Marks drawn on the background use the color space shown in the row labeled hue in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, that interpolates in RGB space from orange at 0 to white at 3, and then to cyan at 6. This limited color space provides the ability for marks across the top and bottom surfaces to be of complimentary colors, but provides a linear, rather than a circular, hue scale. As shown in the row labeled round in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, marks are superquadric ellipses that range from rectangular to round. Mark opacity ranges from fully opaque to fully transparent, replacing background opacity on the top layer wherever a mark appears, so that top textures may range from being opaque with transparent marks to transparent with opaque marks. A Gaussian blur filter is applied to the texture after it is constructed and a parameter varies the size of the filter kernel from 1 (no blur) to 25 pixels. The construction of a texture tile requires explanation because it affects both the placement and shape of marks. Conceptually, a grid is placed over the tile, and a mark can be drawn in each grid cell in a local coordinate frame with origin at the cell center, and anisotropic scaling according to the cell's shape. A regularity parameter controls regularity in three ways: jitter with respect to grid cell centers, rotation of marks within a grid cell (from -45 to 45 degrees), and the probability that a mark will be drawn in a grid cell. The net effect of this parameter is shown in the row labeled regular in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. Four additional parameters control the horizontal and vertical grid cell count, the size of a mark relative to its grid cell, and the aspect ratio of a mark. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows how these four parameters interact to affect mark shape and placement. Grid count parameters specify the number of grid cells as a power of 2. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4a</ref> shows what a rectangular mark of medium size looks like in grids of 1, 2, 8, and 32 cells. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4b</ref> shows various grid settings of 2x32, 4x16, 16x4 and 32x2 with a fixed mid-sized mark. Mark size ranges from 1/8th of the grid cell size at setting 0 to 7/8th of grid cell size at setting 6. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4c</ref> shows the effect of the mark size parameter in a grid with a high number of columns and a low number of rows. Mark aspect ratio ranges from 1:1, conforming to the grid cell shape, to 1:7, which vertically shortens the mark. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4d</ref> shows the effect of the extremes of mark aspect ratio in a grid with a high number of columns and a medium number of rows, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4e</ref> shows the effect in a grid with a medium number of columns and a high number of rows. For textures that have equal or greater number of rows than columns, aspect ratio works as expected, however, for the case of more columns than rows in figure 4d, aspect ratio has an opposite to normal effect. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.3</head><p>High resolution stereoscope The custom designed high-resolution stereoscope used for our experiments is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>. Two IBM T221 'Big Bertha' LCD monitors are mounted on a track on opposite sides of the eye point. The subject looks through a pair of front surface mirrors that presents the left screen to the left eye and the right screen to the right eye in a Wheatstone stereoscope arrangement <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The screens are 48 cm wide and 30 cm high <ref type="bibr">(16:10)</ref>, with a screen resolution of 3840 x 2400, or 9.2 million pixels. For our experiments, the screens were set at a viewing distance of 109 cm. This yielded a visual angle per pixel of approx 23 seconds of arc. This is comparable to the size of receptors in the fovea and is sufficient to display the finest grating pattern that can be resolved by the human eye -about 60 cycles per degree, corresponding to 1 cycle per minute of visual angle <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. According to the manufacturer, the screen contrast ratio is 400:1, and maximum brightness is 235 cd/m 2 . Images were rendered assuming an eye separation of 6.4 cm. 3.4 Genetic Algorithm The parameter space search was controlled by a genetic algorithm that was augmented with islanding capability, intended to speed up convergence of the genetic algorithm, and allow the subject direct control over the area to search. A single generation consisted of 40 texture pairs. Each of these pairs was presented in sequence until all were evaluated. Once a full generation was evaluated, breeding between textures was done using a two-point crossover approach, with the probability of a texture pair being selected for breeding determined by the product of the ratings of the top and bottom surfaces. After finding an exceptional texture, a subject could generate an island population. This created a generation of textures whose parameters are drawn from a Gaussian distribution centered around the selected texture and with a standard deviation of 0.7. Islanding was chosen as an alternative to running the genetic algorithm until convergence. It provided a way for the subject to bring the experimental trial to an end by finely searching an area of texture space known to be good. Previous experiments by House et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> took about three hours per trial, whereas with islanding a trial took less than one hour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DATA ANALYSIS</head><p>Data from the human in the loop experiments was analyzed using several statistical tools. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was a convenient way to look for individual parameters whose settings are critical. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) provided optimal linear classifiers for the data. Decision Trees improved on this, providing non-linear classifiers built as logical expressions. Finally, Parallel Coordinates was a convenient way to visually assess hypotheses about relationships among parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">ANOVA</head><p>ANOVA is a method to test whether an independent variable is a significant factor in determining the values of a dependent variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. It gives a p-value, or probability that each variable is individually a significant factor in determining the rating. At the 1% significance level, all variables were found to be significant except bottom mark chroma and top mark aspect-ratio. The five variables with the largest effect size (measured by Î· 2 ) were top opacity, bottom luminance, top luminance, top mark luminance and top number of columns.</p><p>We looked at box plots, like that in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>, to get an idea of optimal levels for the significant parameters. In the box plot, the red line is the median and the blue box denotes lower and upper quartiles. Whiskers show the 1.5 inter-quartile range of the data and + indicates outliers beyond the whiskers. Notches in the blue box give the possible range of the median. For example, the plots shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> indicate that opacity levels 3 and 4, corresponding with opacities of 50% and 67%, produce the best ratings. From ANOVA analysis, proceeding along the lines described above, we were able to infer various rules for enhancing the visibility of each surface individually, or both together. For example, to see the top surface clearly, the top should have high luminance, and the bottom low luminance. The reverse is true to see the bottom surface clearly. However, to see both together, both surfaces should have high luminance, with the bottom slightly brighter than the top. Opacity of the top surface naturally had the same trend, where an opaque top gave better ratings for the top surface and a transparent top gave better ratings for the bottom surface. For seeing both surfaces, middle-range opacities performed the best, as we saw in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>. Also for seeing both surfaces, the top should have many columns and a medium number of rows, bright opaque marks, without high levels of filtering. The bottom should have many columns, with either bright or dark, high aspect ratio, opaque marks.</p><p>The down-side to using ANOVA analysis is that it only accounts for the effect of single parameters, ignoring the effects of interactions of these parameters. Parameter interaction could be accounted for by including special interaction terms, but with 26 parameters, accounting for all possible combinations is intractable. However, in selected cases it is useful for showing general trends before more complicated methods are used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">LDA</head><p>Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> is a method that finds dimensions that provide the maximum separability of classes, where class membership is determined by the dependent variable. To maximize separability, LDA finds a projection that provides the maximum resulting ratio of between-class to within-class variability. For more than two classes, this can be formulated in terms of an eigenvalue problem, which, if C is the number of classes, returns C-1 eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The corresponding eigenvectors are direction vectors in parameter space, and projecting along them provides maximum separability. The eigenvalues give a measurement of the amount of separation that is achieved along corresponding eigenvectors, essentially a ratio of between-class to within-class separability.</p><p>We performed LDA on our parameter space using three classes representing good, medium and poor textures. The classes were defined by thresholding the top and bottom ratings. The thresholds were chosen to make the number of samples per class equal. Good have both ratings above 6, middle have both above 3, and poor are the remaining textures. The first LDA eigenvalue was 0.27 and the second only 0.019. For this reason we only analyzed the first eigenvector, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref> shows the data projected onto the first 2 eigenvectors. Here, red dots represent good textures, green medium textures, and blue poor textures. As <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref> makes clear, the data is not fully separable using only LDA, but important information can be learned from the first eigenvector. Comparing the components of the vector with good and bad data projections can tell us what parameters need to be either high or low, or do not matter much. In this case, if the parameter's component is strongly positive than it should have a high level to create good textures, if it is strongly negative then it should have a low level, and if it is near zero then the parameter's level does not strongly affect the rating.  From the first eigenvector, we find that to create good visualizations, the top should have many columns and moderately high rows, high luminance, relatively high opacity, unfiltered with medium-sized, very bright, orange, low aspect ratio marks. The bottom should have many columns and moderately high rows, high luminance, medium filtering, with small, irregular marks of medium opacity and high aspect ratio. Because of the interaction between rows, columns and aspect ratio on top and bottom, the top marks will be long and thin like the first texture in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4d</ref>, and the bottom marks will be small and relatively square like the second texture in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4d</ref>. We do not analyse the second eigenvector components, because it is clear from its eigenvalue that it does not significantly separate the classes. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows sample tiles of the top and bottom textures hand-built according to the above criteria. The enhanced version is shown to clarify that there is a very subtle texture on the bottom, which may prove useful for stereo vision. In general the results correspond with those of the ANOVA analysis, though here the top luminance has a slightly higher component than the bottom.   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref> shows the statement (A&amp;B) | (C&amp;D) in decision tree form. Every branch can be thought of as an entry in a truth table, and leaves labeled + denote cases that satisfy the expression, whiledenotes cases that do not. Decision trees can also be used for variables with more levels than simply true or false. In our case, each parameter can have levels between 0 and 6. Also, our outcomes are not simply + or -, but can range from 0 to 9. To model this type of data we used regression trees with a branching factor of 2, where the left branch is all data below a cut-off threshold for the parameter level, and the right branch holds all data above the cut-off. For example, one branch might be for top surface opacities less-than-or-equal-to 5, and the other branch would be fully opaque (opacity = 6). These decision thresholds are chosen by maximizing information gain at each node <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The leaf nodes, rather than predicting merely + or -, predict a value for the combined rating (0-9). This predicted value is the mean ratings of the data in that leaf. This allows us to find rules for nodes with a given predicted rating.</p><p>A large tree can easily over-fit a dataset, modelling noise rather than actual rules. Therefore our tree was pruned to a depth that gave a minimum error when tested using cross-validation. This tree had 153 leaf nodes. The leaf with the highest predicted rating was 8.06, with a standard deviation of 0.77. Its rules were found by following each decision from the root node to the leaf node; these are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Parallel Coordinates</head><p>Parallel coordinates is a method that draws lines for each data point from the value of one parameter to the value of another parameter. Trends in the lines can illuminate patterns in the data. Since our parameter levels are discrete, to keep lines from sitting on top of each other, the parameter values were randomly jittered by (-0.5, 0.5). Choice of parameters, and their ordering were chosen based on hypotheses about the data. For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref> shows trends for good data, defined by the same threshold as for the LDA analysis. The line colors denote groups based on the opacity of the top surface background. This color grouping illuminates trends between background opacity and other top surface parameters, like number of top rows and columns, mark scale and aspect ratio. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> summarizes two patterns in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref>. The magenta lines represent textures that have almost fully opaque backgrounds, and the brown lines those with fully transparent backgrounds.</p><p>This example shows very strong patterns between the top surface shape and opacity parameters. Nearly all parameter combinations showed some distinguishable pattern but some, such as top and bottom mark chroma, showed very little. Lines from each value of top mark chroma tended to 'fan out' to each value of bottom mark chroma equally.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.5</head><p>Summary of results from analysis As a synthesis, we present the following hypotheses. Background luminance is clearly very important. The bottom surface should have high luminance, while the top surface has a trade-off between brightness and opacity, giving it a medium apparent brightness. Both top and bottom should have high numbers of columns, tending to give them long, thin marks with a global striping structure. Marks on the top should be prominent -large, bright, opaque, with low aspectratio. Marks on the bottom should be less prominent -small, less opaque, with high aspect-ratio. We also hypothesize that there are two types of top surface textures that work well. First, ones that have a semi-opaque top, using the shading of the background to see the bumps and the marks just to help distinguish the surface, and second, ones that have a transparent background, and larger marks so the shading on the marks themselves can show the shape of the bumps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION OF RESULTS</head><p>Given our hypotheses, we automatically generated sixty texture pairs, whose parameters were randomly set to be within the acceptable ranges for the hypotheses. Twenty-nine of these were generated according to decision tree rules. Four were made to be 'bad' using the rules for a leaf with a mean rating of 1.15. Five were made to be 'poor' using rules for a leaf with a mean rating of 4.57. Ten were made to be 'fair' using rules for a leaf with a mean rating of 5.47. Finally, ten were made 'good' using the rules for the best leaf node with a mean rating of 8.06. The other thirty-one textures were created by narrowing the decision tree rules using the good variable ranges found from the other analysis methods. Twenty (enhanced-A) were created to have a medium opacity top surface with medium-sized marks, and eleven (enhanced-B) were created to have a low opacity top surface with larger marks. The number of textures created for each set of rules was chosen according to the expected quality, and the total number of visualizations that subjects could rate within about 1/2 hour. Six subjects were asked to rate the sixty randomly ordered visualizations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref> shows a plot of the combined ratings given by each subject, colored by subject identity. There is a clear agreement in general trends; correlations between subjects were greater than 0.57 for all subject pairings, which has a significance p-value of less than .0001. Each individual's ratings were normalized to range from 0 to 9 for statistical analysis. Line color denotes experimental subject. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref> is a box plot of the rating distributions for textures with expected ratings of bad, poor, fair, good, and the two enhanced categories. Both bad and poor textures performed almost exactly as expected, though the fair textures did better than expected, with median better than the textures based on the good rules. Also, the enhanced-B category, with low opacity top surface and larger marks, performed little better than the 'good' textures. However, the best performers were the enhanced-A group having mid-range opacity and medium top marks.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref> shows the texture pairs with the eight best mean ratings. Six of the eight best texture pairs had medium top opacities, high luminance, with relatively small marks, while two others, (40) and (39), had low opacities and large marks. Various color combinations existed, and all had prominent marks either on the top or the bottom, more commonly the top. In (2), both layers have strong marks, but the bottom marks are strongly blurred. (34) has no visible marks on the top, but prominent ones on the bottom. All have medium to high randomness. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 14</ref> shows screenshots of the textures in (4) and (40) mapped onto surfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We find the following general rules for creating good sets of top and bottom textures: These in general agree with the rules given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, who found that the bottom should be brighter than the top, the marks on top should be larger than the marks on the bottom, color can be freely chosen. Overall, the marks in this experiment were smaller than their successful ones. We attribute this to the smaller size of the salient features (bumps) in this experiment, and possibly to the improved resolution of the display. Also, this experiment showed a strong preference for high randomness of the marks, whereas the old experiment showed a preference for regular marks on top and random marks on the bottom. Again, this is probably due to the smaller size of the salient features. Structured marks might not line up with a small bump, whereas at least some random marks are likely to lie on a bump. These results coincide well with the style used by Interrante in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, where the outer surface had prominent white line segments around a high-luminance, un-textured inner surface. Although we use surface-independent textures, our findings suggest that these settings should work well, although perhaps a subtle texture on the bottom surface could improve the overall shape perception.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">â€¢</formula><p>We conclude that our method is well suited to discovering rules regarding complicated problems. The genetic algorithm allows an initial search of a very general, broad hypothesis space where few constraints are made on the parameters. However, this search is done in an efficient manner, searching good areas in more depth. This data can then be mined to produce hypotheses about good textures. These hypotheses could be checked in more detail, but with less generality, by using them to constrain the parameter space. This constrained space could then be explored by more traditional controlled psychophysical studies. This can be done with a level of certainty that the non-varying parameters have been set at optimal values and that the varying parameters are the important ones to explore.</p><p>For our future work, we are interested in finding out what sorts of textures are good under different viewing conditions, such as images in printed media. Our intuition is that textures with more prominent top marks will be superior for print because the shading information from the marks helps to disambiguate one surface from another. Also, some of the very fine-grained bottom textures that seem to work so well in stereo, are invisible at low resolutions, and would need some adjustments. We are also interested in exploring surface conforming textures.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>a) human-in-the-loop experimental process b) surfaces and textures from earlier experiment.</figDesc></figure>
