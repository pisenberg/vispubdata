				<p>In multiresolution volume visualization, a visual representation of level-of-detail (LOD) quality is important for us to examine, compare, and validate different LOD selection algorithms. While traditional methods rely on ultimate images for quality measurement, we introduce the LOD map-an alternative representation of LOD quality and a visual interface for navigating multiresolution data exploration. Our measure for LOD quality is based on the formulation of entropy from information theory. The measure takes into account the distortion and contribution of multiresolution data blocks. A LOD map is generated through the mapping of key LOD ingredients to a treemap representation. The ordered treemap layout is used for relative stable update of the LOD map when the view or LOD changes. This visual interface not only indicates the quality of LODs in an intuitive way, but also provides immediate suggestions for possible LOD improvement through visually-striking features. It also allows us to compare different views and perform rendering budget control. A set of interactive techniques is proposed to make the LOD adjustment a simple and easy task. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach on large scientific and medical data sets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The field of visualization is concerned with the creation of images from data. In many cases these images are observed by humans in an effort to test hypotheses and discover insights. Visualization is, therefore, an iterative and exploratory process. Human-computer interactions, such as parameter tweaking, are often involved in a bid to create better representations. This scenario works well for small data. With the advances in graphics hardware, the interactivity can be guaranteed even with a straightforward implementation. For larger data, the response time of a visualization system could become uncomfortably long. Slower responses result in an increase in time needed to obtain insights from the data. This poses a great challenge for visualization to be effective and efficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we focus on the subject of multiresolution rendering in the context of large volume visualization. A central theme for multiresolution volume rendering is the selection of data resolution, or level-of-detail (LOD). Quite often, such LODs are automatically determined by user-specified error tolerances and viewing parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. Many of the metrics, such as mean square error (MSE) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), are data-centric in the sense that they measure the distortion between low and high resolution blocks in the data space (Geometric error metrics, on the other hand, are often used in surface rendering, where the geometry or mesh is known. In this paper, we do not consider this case.). Although those metrics have specific meanings and are simple to compute, they are not effective in predicting the quality of rendered images due to the lack of correlation between data and image <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In fact, finding the best LOD is a NP-complete optimization problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, so most algorithms take a greedy approximation strategy instead. In this case, data blocks are selected according to their priority values till certain constraints, such as the block budget, are met. Rarely, we have a mechanism to examine the quality of LODs selected from those greedy selections, and decide whether it is possible to further improve the quality through either automatic methods or user interactions.</p><p>Another important but non-trivial issue is the validation of existing LOD selection algorithms. In computer graphics and visualization, validation is usually done through side-by-side comparison of images created from different techniques. However, this may not be effective for multiresolution volume visualization. This is because direct rendering of 3D volumes to 2D images involves light attenuation, blending, and transfer function mapping, where much information about a LOD may be hidden or lost. Without the complete information, it could be insufficient to assess the improvements of new algorithms over existing ones. Moreover, a large data set is often too complex to be understood from a single image. Inspecting images from different views requires rendering large amount of data, which makes it very difficult for us to perform the validation efficiently. From the problems mentioned above, it can be seen that there is a great need to devise techniques for multiresolution volume visualization that allow the user to examine, compare, and validate the quality of LOD selection and rendering. To fulfill this need, we present a new measure for LOD quality based on the formulation of entropy from information theory. Our quality measure takes into account the quality of each individual data block in a LOD and the relationships among them. This entropy measure allows us to map key ingredients of the LOD quality to a treemap representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, called the LOD map, for further visual analysis. The LOD map brings us a novel approach for navigating the exploration of large multiresolution data. By "navigating", we mean the user is guided with immediate visual feedback when making decisions about where to go, what to do, and when to stop. The user is provided with cues that leads her quickly to interesting parts of the data. She would readily know what actions to take to adjust the LOD, clearly see the gain or loss of the adjustment, and be informed when the refinement process may be stopped. Leveraging a heuristic optimization algorithm and a set of interactive techniques designed for the LOD map, making LOD adjustment and rendering budget control becomes a simple and easy task. Experimental results on large data sets demonstrate that this visual representation of LOD quality is light-weighted yet quite effective for interactive LOD comparison and validation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>The past few years witnessed the rapid growth of data. Scientific simulations are producing petabytes of data as opposed to gigabytes or terabytes a couple of years ago. Building a multiresolution data hierarchy from large amount of data allows us to visualize data at different scales, and balance image quality and computation speed. Examples of hierarchical data representation for volume data include the Laplacian pyramid <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, multi-dimensional trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and octree-based hierarchies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Muraki introduced the use of wavelet transforms for vol-umetric data <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Westermann <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> proposed a framework for approximating the volume rendering integral using multiresolution spaces and wavelet projections. Guthe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> presented a wavelet-encoded hierarchical representation, called the wavelet tree, that supports interactive walkthroughs of large data sets on a single commodity PC. In this paper, we use the wavelet tree as an illustration for our presentation.</p><p>The goal of visual data exploration is to facilitate the extraction of new insights from the data. For instance, Marks et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> presented the Design Gallery system that treats image and volume rendering as a process of exploring a multidimensional parameter space. Using an image difference metric, the system arranges renderings from various parameter settings, from which the user selects the most appealing one. Bajaj et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> introduced the contour spectrum, a user interface component that improves qualitative user interaction and provides real-time exact qualification in the visualization of isocontours. A set of well-designed manipulation widgets for multidimensional transfer function design was given by Kniss et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. By allowing direct interaction in the spatial and transfer function domains, those widgets make finding transfer functions an intuitive and efficient process.</p><p>On the other hand, the process of visual data exploration contains a wealth of information -parameters, results, history, as well as relationships among them. To learn lessons and share experiences, the process itself can be stored, tracked, and analyzed. It can also be incorporated into, and thus becomes a part of the user interface of a visualization system. Such examples are image graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and interfaces with spreadsheet <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and parallel coordinate <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> styles. A general model of the visualization exploration process was formalized by Jankun-Kelly et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Over the last decade, a number of information visualization techniques have been developed to support the visual exploration of large and high-dimensional data sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Parallel coordinates and treemaps are two most widely-used techniques among them. The treemap <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> is a space-filling method for visualizing large hierarchical information. It works by recursively subdividing a given display area based on the hierarchical structure, and alternating between vertical and horizontal subdivisions. The information of an individual node is presented via visual attributes, such as color and size, of its bounding rectangle. Originally designed to visualize files on a hard drive, treemaps have been applied to a wide variety of domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>One of the notable commercial applications of treemaps is the SmartMoney "Map of the Market", a simple yet powerful tool for the general public to spot investment trends and opportunities. The map shows approximately 600 publicly traded companies grouped by sector and industry. The size of each company in the map corresponds to its market capitalization. The color mapping is natural for most users to look for visually-striking features: green for gain, red for loss, and dark for neutral. A recursive algorithm was devised to reduces overall aspect ratios of the rectangles for more readable display. All these factors contributes the success of the Map of the Market. Inspired by this application, we strive for simplicity and effectiveness in search of our solution for navigating multiresolution data exploration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">LOD ANALYSIS</head><p>In the visualization of multiresolution volume data, a given LOD consists of a sequence of data blocks at various resolutions. Intuitively, the LOD quality can be analyzed by investigating the quality of each individual block as well as the relationships among them: Each block may contain a different distortion because of the resolution and data variation. It may also convey a different optical content if a color and opacity transfer function is applied. Furthermore, the sequence of data blocks are rendered to the screen. Each block may have a different contribution to the image depending on its projection and how much it is occluded by other blocks. To optimize the total information received on the image, one may attempt to either adjust the LOD or change the view. The concept of entropy from information theory provides us a way to measure the LOD quality in a quantitative manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Entropy</head><p>In information theory, the entropy gives the average information or the uncertainty of a random variable. The Shannon entropy of a discrete random variable X with values in the finite set {a1, a2, ..., aM } is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H(X) = âˆ’ M X i=1 pi log pi (1)</formula><p>where pi is the probability of a variable to have the value ai; âˆ’ log pi represents its associated information. The unit of information is call a bit. The logarithm is taken in base 2 or e. For continuity, variable of probability zero does not contribute to the entropy, i.e., 0 log 0 = 0. The entropy achieves its maximum of log M when the probability distribution is uniform.</p><p>To evaluate the quality of a LOD, we first define the probability of a multiresolution data block bi as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">pi = Ci â€¢ Di S , where S = M X i=1 Ci â€¢ Di<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where Ci and Di are the contribution and distortion of bi respectively (more details about these two terms are given in Section 3.2); M is the total number of blocks in the multiresolution data hierarchy. The summation S is taken over all data blocks, and the division by S is required to make all probabilities add up to unity. Eqn. 2 states that the probability of a data block in a LOD is high if it has large distortion and high contribution. The entropy of a LOD then follows the definition in Eqn. 1. Note that for any LOD, it is impossible for all the data blocks in the hierarchy to have the equal probability of 1/M , i.e., a LOD could not achieve an entropy value of log M . This is because in any LOD, if a parent block is selected, then none of its descendant blocks will be selected. Any block which is not included in the LOD receives zero probability and does not contribute to the entropy. Ideally, since a higher entropy indicates a better LOD quality, the best LOD (with the highest information content) could be achieved when we select all the leaf nodes in the data hierarchy. However, this requires rendering the volume data at the original resolution, and defeats the purpose of multiresolution rendering.</p><p>In practice, a meaningful goal is to find the best LOD under some rendering budget, such as a certain block budget, which is usually much smaller than M . Accordingly, the quality of a LOD could be improved by splitting data blocks with large distortion and high contribution, and joining those blocks with small distortion and low contribution. The split operation aims at increasing the entropy with a more balanced probability distribution. The join operation is to offset the increase in block number and keep it under the budget. In addition, adjusting the view could improve the quality of LOD too, since the contributions of data blocks vary when the view changes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Distortion and Contribution</head><p>In a multiresolution data hierarchy such as a wavelet tree, a block having larger distortion or variation is more likely to receive a higher priority for LOD refinement. The distortion of a multiresolution data block captures this intrinsic property. Let us first consider two data blocks bi and bj , where bj is an immediate child of bi. We define the distortion between bi and bj as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">dij = Ïƒij â€¢ Âµ 2 i + Âµ 2 j + C1 2ÂµiÂµj + C1 â€¢ Ïƒ 2 i + Ïƒ 2 j + C2 2ÏƒiÏƒj + C2 (3)</formula><p>where Ïƒij is the covariance between bi and bj; Âµi and Âµj are the mean values of bi and bj respectively; Ïƒi and Ïƒj are their standard deviations. We include small constants C1 and C2 to avoid instability when ÂµiÂµj and ÏƒiÏƒj are very close to zero. Eqn. 3 consists of three parts, namely, covariance, luminance distortion, and contrast distortion. Collectively, these three parts capture the distortion between the two blocks. The luminance distortion and contrast distortion are originally from the image quality assessment literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and have been shown to be consistent with the luminance masking and contrast masking features in the human visual system respectively.</p><p>In a wavelet tree, a parent node has eight immediate children. Thus, we add distortions between the parent block and its eight child blocks. We also take into account the maximum distortion of the child blocks, as an approximation of the distortion between the parent block and the original full-resolution data it represents. Written in equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Di = 7 X j=0 dij + max{Dj | 7 j=0 }<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where Di and Dj are the distortions of blocks bi and bj respectively. As a special case, if bi is associated with a leaf node in the hierarchy, we define Di = C3, where C3 is a small constant. The distortion for each tree node can be calculated as we build up the multiresolution data hierarchy. They are then normalized for our use.</p><p>To evaluate the contribution of a multiresolution block bi to the image, we treat the coarse-grained data block as a whole and approximate its contribution as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Ci = Âµ â€¢ t â€¢ a â€¢ Î½ (5)</formula><p>where Âµ is the mean value of bi; t is its thickness (the average length of the viewing ray segment inside bi); a is the screen projection area of the block, and Î½ is its estimated visibility. Here, similar to the well-known composition equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, (Âµ â€¢ t â€¢ a) approximates the emission of bi, and Î½ accounts for the occlusion. Depending on our need, Âµ, Ïƒ, and Ïƒij in Eqn. 3 and 5 can be evaluated directly in the scalar data space, or in the perceptually-adapted CIELUV color space (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> for more detail). In Section 7.2, we will describe our pre-computation and real-time update techniques for calculating D and C of multiresolution data blocks, which ensure a quick update of the entropy value for a LOD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Heuristic Algorithm</head><p>Based on the entropy measure, we propose a three-stage heuristic algorithm to adjust a LOD automatically. The given LOD could come from any LOD selection methods. The motivation is to balance the probability distribution among all data blocks in the LOD, and improve its entropy. Our three-stage algorithm is as follows: Note that join or split operations in our algorithm will only increase the entropy, if possible, but never decrease. This monotonic condition guarantees the convergence of the algorithm. Our heuristic algorithm could also be used to generate a balanced LOD (in terms of probability distribution) given the constraint of block budget. The algorithm refines the LOD starting from the root of the data hierarchy until the block budget is met.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">LOD MAP</head><p>Although various efforts have been made to choose proper LODs that condense data and preserve features <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>, little work has been done to represent and validate this decision-making process. Actually, the information derived for data selection is knowledge that guides the user through the entire solution space. Such knowledge saves time on decision and computation, which the user would have otherwise spent on a trial-and-error search. The time saved may be used to improve frame rates or alternatively, on other techniques to better understand the data. The formulation of LOD quality in Section 3 tells us that a LOD is good if it has a high entropy value. Thus, a good LOD not only indicates a good quality of rendered images, but also a balanced probability distribution for all the data blocks in the LOD. This includes information of both what we can perceive (data blocks not occluded) and can not (data blocks occluded) from the rendered image. Therefore, a suitable visual representation for LOD quality should reveal not only what is visible, but also what is not. Such information is important because it can help us answer questions such as "do we waste the budget on those blocks which are occluded?", or, "can we generate an image of similar quality with a reduced block budget?". In order to avoid possible occlusion, we rule out the option of any 3D representation of LODs. Actually, a 2D treemap provides a simple yet effective representation of large hierarchical structure. The key issues involved in this knowledge representation are information mapping and layout design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Information Mapping</head><p>In this paper, we call the treemap representation of LOD the LOD map. As a treemap, the LOD map is formed by recursively subdividing a given area. Each data block in the LOD is represented as a rectangle in the LOD map. Treemaps can effectively visualize data with two attributes, in which one attribute is typically mapped to the size of the rectangles, and the other attribute to the color of the rectangles. The critical question to ask is what information should be displayed in the generated rectangles for the LOD map.</p><p>Since the treemaps are commonly used for representing hierarchical structures. A first thought along this direction could lead us to use the size of rectangle to encode the resolution of different data blocks in the LOD map. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the size of the rectangle can be determined by the level of the data hierarchy the data block lies on. Although this way of representing LODs is natural, the mapping only yields limited usefulness. This is because which level of the hierarchy a data block lies on may not give hints on its actual quality. A data block at a low level (low resolution) may contain empty space or have a uniform value. In contrast, another data block at a high level (high resolution) may still exhibit much variation or distortion. Therefore, this kind of coding does not grant insights, and wastes important channels which could be used to encode more essential LOD information.</p><p>The entropy characterizes the quality of a LOD. To reveal this key information, we map its ingredients, i.e., the distortion D and contribution C of a data block in the LOD, to the color and size of its bounding rectangle in the LOD map. More specifically:</p><p>â€¢ The color assignment is based on the distortion D: red for large distortion, magenta for medium, and blue for small.</p><p>â€¢ The contribution C is split into two parts: (Âµ â€¢ t â€¢ a) is mapped to the size of the rectangle, while Î½ is assigned to its opacity.</p><p>This color and size coding scheme makes it easy for the user to look for "hot spots" -data blocks with large distortion and high contribution in the LOD map. The motivation for separating visibility Î½ from C is intuitive too: more visible blocks in the LOD should appear brighter in the LOD map, and less visible ones darker.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Layout Design</head><p>Another key issue for the generation of LOD map is layout design. In the early 1990s when treemaps were first prototyped, a straightforward  slice-and-dice algorithm was used to generate the treemap layout. A problem with this standard method is that it often produces rectangles with high aspect ratios. As a result, such skinny rectangles can be difficult to see, compare, and select. Over the years, several algorithms have been proposed to improve the aspect ratios of rectangles in the treemap <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. However, they introduce instability over time in the display of dynamically changing data, and fail to preserve an ordering of the underlying data. These drawbacks are critical in our LOD map representation because:</p><p>â€¢ The information of a LOD keeps changing whenever the user makes LOD adjustment or changes the view. If the LOD map layout has dramatic changes that causes unattractive flickering, it is hard to select and track data blocks in the LOD map.</p><p>â€¢ A LOD often comes with the back-to-front viewing order, in which neighboring blocks are close to each other in the LOD. Preserving this order in the LOD map layout is important for locating neighboring blocks and observing group patterns.</p><p>The ordered treemap introduced by Shneiderman and Wattenberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> uses layout algorithms that offer a good tradeoff among stable updates, order preserving, and low aspect ratios. In this paper, we adopt this layout design for our LOD map representation. The layout algorithm is similar to the idea of finding a 2D analogue of the QuickSort algorithm. The inputs are a rectangle R to be subdivided and a list of items that are ordered by an index and have given areas. The crux of the algorithm is to choose a special item, the pivot, which is placed at the side of R. The remaining items in the list are then assigned to three large rectangles that make up the rest of the display area. Finally, the algorithm is applied recursively to each of these rectangles. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> for a more detailed description of the algorithm. Variations of the algorithm are the choices of pivot. The pivot could be the item with the largest area in the list (pivot-by-size), or the middle item of the list (pivot-by-middle). In Section 7.1, we will discuss two scenarios where each of these choices of pivot should be used for smooth update.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Put It All Together</head><p>Having discussed how to define and represent the quality of LODs, it is time to put it all together and show how our scheme can be used. We experimented our idea with the Richtmyer-Meshkov Instability (RMI) data set <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The 7.5GB RMI data set has the spatial dimension of 2048 Ã— 2048 Ã— 1920, from which we built a wavelet tree with a tree depth of six. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> shows a LOD rendering of the RMI data set at the third tree level and its LOD map layouts. The viewing order is roughly preserved, as we can see that darker/brighter rectangles (data blocks with lower/higher visibility) are close to each other in the LOD map. Since a LOD map encodes the entropy information of a LOD, if there is an unbalanced probability distribution among data blocks in the LOD, we can easily perceive this through color and size attributes of rectangles in its LOD map. Then, as demonstrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1 (b)</ref> or (c), several directions for optimizing the LOD quality can be immediately followed:</p><p>â€¢ Look for "hot spots" -large rectangles with bright red colors. They are highly-visible data blocks that have high contribution and large distortion. Splitting these blocks will most likely increase the entropy and improve the LOD quality.</p><p>â€¢ Small blue rectangles are data blocks that have low contribution and small distortion. If they cluster in a local region, joining these blocks may save the block budget without decreasing the entropy.</p><p>â€¢ Dark rectangles are data blocks with the lowest visibility. If many of them cluster together, joining these blocks may also save the block budget without sacrificing the LOD quality.</p><p>The next section introduces a set of interactive techniques that allows the user to perform LOD adjustment efficiently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">INTERACTIVE TECHNIQUES</head><p>In computer graphics and visualization, brushing has been used as a method for selecting subsets of data for further operations, such as highlighting, deleting, or analysis. In our case, brushing is used to select a subset of data blocks from a LOD for join or split operations. We provide brushing in both views: the rendering window and the LOD map. The result of selection is highlighted in both views, as they are linked together and updated dynamically whenever one of the views changes. This technique helps the user detect correspondences between the two different visual representations. We allow the user to perform brushing in the following ways:</p><p>â€¢ Direct brushing in the LOD map by clicking a rectangle, or specifying a rectangular region to select multiple rectangles simultaneously via mouse.</p><p>â€¢ Brushing in the rendering window by specifying the brush coverage as 1D point, 2D plane, or 3D box in the data space via slider.</p><p>â€¢ Brushing some parameter (such as visibility Î½) or combination of parameters by specifying its range via slider.</p><p>Direct transformation is provided for interactivity and examination of local details. The user can translate, scale, and rotate the 3D volume in the rendering window, and translate and scale the 2D LOD map. Data blocks selected in the LOD are highlighted with red boundaries and white crosses in the rendering window and the LOD map respectively. The user then proceeds to join or split these blocks. A join operation merges a selected block with its siblings into its parent block. A split operation breaks a selected block into its eight child blocks. For multiple selected data blocks, they are put into a queue and processed in sequence. We also provide the "undo" function so that the user can roll back to the previous LOD if the operation just performed is not desired.</p><p>(a) brushing with 2D plane (b) LOD map    <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>.

The plot shows how the entropy changes with different block budgets for three LOD selection methods. There are a total of 10499 non-empty blocks in the data hierarchy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">RESULTS</head><p>As listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, we experimented with our LOD map on two data sets: the RMI data set (also mentioned in Section 4.3) from scientific simulation, and the visible woman (VisWoman) data set from medical application. For both data sets, the Haar wavelet transform with a lifting scheme was used to construct the wavelet tree data hierarchy. A lossless compression scheme was used with the threshold set to zero to compress the wavelet coefficients. To ensure seamless rendering, we extended one voxel overlapping boundaries between neighboring blocks in each dimension when breaking the original volume data into blocks. As a result, both hierarchies have a tree depth of six. All tests were performed on a 3.0GHz Intel Xeon processor with 3GB main memory, and an nVidia GeForce 7800 GT graphics card with 256MB video memory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">LOD Comparison</head><p>For LOD comparison, we took three commonly-used LOD selection methods, i.e., level-based, MSE-based, and SNR-based, for our test. The level-based method selects a particular resolution level in the multiresolution data hierarchy. For the MSE-based (SNR-based) method, we specify the MSE (SNR) error tolerance to determine the LOD (we followed Eqn. 4 where dij is the MSE (SNR) of blocks bi and bj). <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> gives an example where we compared the LOD quality of the MSE-based and level-based methods under the same block budget. Clearly, we can see that <ref type="figure">Fig. 3 (b)</ref> contains two "hot spots" (large rectangles with bright red colors) and some small blue rectangles clustered together. These are indications of bad distribution of data resolution. On the contrary, <ref type="figure">Fig. 3 (d)</ref> exhibits a much better distribution. It follows that the level-based method achieves a better LOD quality than the MSE-based one. Their entropy values and rendered images in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3 (a)</ref> and (c) also confirm this. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4 and 5</ref> show the change of entropy values on the two data sets under a series of block budgets. For the level-based method, the block budget increases eight folds when the level increases by one. Therefore, isolated data points rather than polylines are illustrated in both figures. For both data sets, we can see that the MSE-based and SNRbased LOD methods could not outperform the straightforward levelbased method in terms of the tradeoff between LOD quality and block budget, although the level-based method does not allow flexible block budgets. For the RMI data set, the MSE-based method performs consistently better than the SNR-based one. However, this is not the case for the VisWoman data set, as the two polylines intertwine with each other in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref>. Another finding is that the entropy does not always increase (actually decreases sometimes) with the increase of block budget. This does not indicate the deterioration in rendered image quality, but rather, a less balanced distribution of probability among all the data blocks. In fact, we can imagine this potentially leaves room for us to improve the LOD quality (see Section 4.3) using the LOD map.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">View Comparison</head><p>The quality of a given LOD can be improved by adjusting the view. Similar to the ideas of view selection presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, the entropy and the LOD map can help us find good views for a certain LOD. <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> gives an example where we compare different views for a fixed LOD of the RMI data set. The entropy increases as more information context is received from <ref type="figure">Fig. 6 (a)</ref> to (d). Looking at the sequence of LOD maps, we can observe that the visibility of the LOD gets improved since the entire LOD map is getting brighter. Another finding from the LOD map sequence is that smaller blocks at the bottom of the volume corresponds to blue rectangles (small distortion) at the upper-right part of <ref type="figure">Fig. 6 (a)</ref>, and larger blocks at the top of the volume corresponds to red rectangles (large distortion) in the LOD maps. The relative stable update of the LOD map allows us to detect such correspondences between the rendered blocks and the rectangles. This information is useful when it comes to LOD adjustment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">LOD Adjustment</head><p>The goal of LOD adjustment is to improve the quality of LOD. By splitting data blocks with large distortion and high contribution, and joining data blocks with small distortion and low contribution, we achieve a more balanced probability distribution among all data blocks, and therefore, increase the entropy of the LOD. <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref> show two examples of LOD adjustment on the RMI and VisWoman data sets within fixed block budgets. For the RMI data set, we clearly see some "hot spots" (large rectangles with bright red colors) and a cluster of dark rectangles (occluded data blocks) in the LOD map of <ref type="figure">Fig. 7  (a)</ref>. In this example, we used the heuristic algorithm (Section 3.3) to optimize the LOD automatically. The LOD map after adjustment in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7 (b)</ref> shows a more balanced result. For the VisWoman data set, hot spots are popping out in the LOD map of <ref type="figure">Fig. 7 (c)</ref>. Although there are no dark rectangles, many small blue rectangles cluster at the lower-left corner of the LOD map. The LOD quality is improved by splitting those hot spots and joining small blue rectangles. With the assist of a set of brushing techniques (Section 5), selecting such target rectangles in the LOD map and performing LOD adjustment becomes a simple and efficient task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Budget Control</head><p>As demonstrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> and 5, the commonly-used MSE-based and SNR-based LOD selection methods do not perform well (in terms of improving the quality of LOD) with the increase of block budget. This gives us opportunities to control the block budget. That is, if such a LOD selection algorithm could not optimize the quality of LOD under a certain block budget, could we instead give a LOD of similar quality but with a reduced block budget? Generating images of similar quality with smaller budgets is appealing for large data visualization because  it could save us limited resources. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8</ref> shows an example of budget control on the RMI data set. By joining data blocks with low visibility (dark rectangles) and improving the overall distribution of resolution, we reduce the block budget by 25% while increasing the entropy of the LOD. This budget control does not affect the quality of rendered image, as the renderings before and after the budget control are almost identical.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">DISCUSSION</head><p>As a reflection of what we state at the beginning of the paper, we discuss the effectiveness and efficiency of our LOD map approach to multiresolution volume visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Effectiveness</head><p>Using entropy, our LOD quality measure becomes a global quality index, i.e., it not only indicates the quality of rendered images, but also the probability distribution of all multiresolution data blocks in the LOD. The probability takes into account the distortion and contribution of data blocks. Therefore, a high entropy (good distribution) implies a balanced distribution of resources (e.g. data resolution), which is not captured by traditional LOD selection methods. Through the mapping of key LOD ingredients to a treemap representation, we create the LOD map as a visual interface for LOD comparison and validation. The LOD map is an intuitive representation of LOD quality, since key ingredients of a LOD are mapped to pre-attentive attributes (color and size of rectangles) in the LOD map. Integrating a heuristic algorithm and a set of interactive techniques, it also serves as a convenient user interface for visual data exploration. Note that the LOD map can be manipulated independently, and the actual rendering of data could be deferred until a desired LOD of good quality is achieved. The results in Section 6 demonstrate that this visual interface is light-weighted and quite effective for multiresolution volume visualization. For the LOD map, we utilize both pivot-by-size and pivot-bymiddle layouts for relative stable update when the view or LOD changes. The choice of which layout should be used depends on which layout is more likely to keep the pivot unchanged. For example, if the view changes, the middle item in the LOD list is more likely to remain the same, as opposed to the item with the largest area. Therefore, the pivot-by-middle layout should be used. On the other hand, if a LOD undergoes any join or split operations, then the pivot-by-size layout should be used, since the item with the largest area in the LOD list is more likely to keep unchanged rather than the middle item. This simple rule proves very effective in maintaining smooth update of the LOD map.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Efficiency</head><p>In order to generate the LOD map in real time, we need quick update of the distortion D and contribution C for multiresolution data blocks. In this paper, we calculate D in the roughly perceptuallyuniform CIELUV color space (note that in this case, D depends on the input color and opacity transfer function). Similar to error calculation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, we pre-compute and store summary tables to ensure real-time update of the distortion D. The summary tables are the histogram table (frequency of quantized scalar values) and correspondence table (frequency of pairs of quantized scalar values in the parent and its child blocks) for each data block in the multiresolution data hierarchy. A zigzag run-length encoding scheme is used to reduce the storage overhead and facilitate the table lookup at run time. During the rendering, we can recompute the distortion within seconds for large data sets (such as the 7.5GB RMI data set) whenever the transfer function changes.</p><p>On the other hand, the quick update of the contribution C requires real-time estimate of the visibility Î½ (Eqn. 5). Here, the essential question is how to calculate the visibility of many data blocks quickly, given an input occlusion map. Our solution is based on summed area tables (SATs), which take the occlusion map as the input. We utilize the GPU to estimate the average visibility. The GPU implementation builds the SATs in passes with the support of framebuffer objects (GL_EXT_framebuffer_object). Getting the average visibility for a block is performed by a fragment program that looks up four corners of its projection in the SATs. In this way, the visibility for all the data blocks can be evaluated interactively at run time. For instance, it only takes around 0.2 second to update the visibility of thousands of data blocks for the RMI data set. We refer readers to <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> for the algorithm, implementation, and performance of our summary table scheme and GPU-based visibility estimation.</p><p>The efficiency of our LOD map is thus ensured with a real-time update of the distortion D and contribution C. Our experiments show that at run time when we change the view or perform LOD adjustment, the entropy and the LOD map can be updated interactively for a LOD consisting of up to thousands of data blocks (a typical magnitude for our multiresolution data hierarchies).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We have presented a new LOD quality measure using entropy and its visual representation using the LOD map for multiresolution volume visualization. Leveraging this quality measure and visual interface, it becomes not only feasible, but also effective and efficient for us to examine, compare, and validate the quality of LOD selection and rendering. We believe that this technique could be generalized, and applied to explore other solution spaces that exhibit similar properties as the LOD optimization problem.</p><p>The LOD map could carry more customized information for a LOD. For example, if the user wants to inspect how the transfer function contents of data blocks vary from their scalar field contents, we can add shading to the rectangles in the LOD map to indicate this. Texture could also be applied to the LOD map to represent some other information of interest. User study along this direction, such as investigating how many channels the user can perceive easily in the LOD map without information overload, is necessary. In the future, we also would like to extend our approach to multiresolution visualization of large-scale time-varying data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Join: Locate the data block b l with the lowest probability.
