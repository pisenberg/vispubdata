				<p>We have developed a Web 2.0 thin client visualization framework called GeoBoost™. Our framework focuses on geospatial visualization and using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), AJAX, RSS and GeoRSS we have built a complete thin client component set. Our component set provides a rich user experience that is completely browser based. It includes maps, standard business charts, graphs, and time-oriented components. The components are live, interactive, linked, and support real time collaboration.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>GeoBoost™ is a thin client collaborative visualization framework for building Web 2.0 browser-based geospatial applications.</p><p>GeoBoost runs in both J2EE and .NET environments and leverages new programming techniques such as AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) and browser-based graphics standards such SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) to enable developers to build rich, interactive thin-client geospatial applications that support collaboration. The advantage of this approach to building applications is that thin client applications run natively within a browser without the need to install any client software, applets, or plug-ins. This advantage translates into lowcost deployment to many users and the ability to support many devices for real-time operational decision-making.</p><p>One of the surprising aspects of our GeoBoost framework is its performance. GeoBoost visual components support interaction, tooltips, dynamic queries, filtering, selection, panning, and zooming. The interactive performance GeoBoost obtains as thin client is comparable to some of the best implementations of desktop visualization software. These components are interesting because they have the capability to connect to live RSS streams, ingest the real-time data, and display the resulting information. The end-user programming model for GeoBoost visual components is also interesting and involves JSP custom tags and ASP .NET user controls. As a result it is easy for programmers to include GeoBoost components in their web applications using standard HTML tags.</p><p>The GeoBoost map component is particularly interesting. It is an OGC ® (Open Geospatial Consortium) WMS (Web Mapping Service) and WFS (Web Feature Server) -compatible client that supports rich interactivity such as panning, scrolling, and zooming. For dynamic interactive operations raster data is asynchronously requested from WMS servers using AJAX requests. Feature data is rendered on top of the raster data using SVG layers. It is also a collaborative geospatial wiki. Users may mark, annotate, edit, and draw arbitrary shapes onto the map. The polygons corresponding to these shapes and annotations can be propagated to other connected users to allow collaboration over marked areas of interest.</p><p>Secondly, GeoBoost provides a series of servers to stream imagery, feature data, and RSS for consumption by GeoBoost visual components. Thin clients have limited processing power and systems built around thin client architectures need more server support than equivalent desktop systems. Thus GeoBoost server components enable flexible data ingestion, image and feature data tiling, tile caching, performance optimization, and provide built-in support for tracking and collaboration features. These server components are necessary to support thin client interfaces and applications. The third interesting component of GeoBoost is the GeoBoost AJAX portal. This portal provides a live framework for content, e.g. web pages, to be integrated in, customized, and tailored to specific use cases. Users with different job functions may customize GeoBoost content for their specific needs and thereby incorporate task-specific workflow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RICH INTERNET APPLICATIONS</head><p>Applications built using the GeoBoost™ platform are described best as Rich Internet Applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref> (RIAs).</p><p>Although Macromedia coined the term, a RIA today is understood to be an application that runs in a web browser and provides an interactive and responsive user interface that has traditionally been found in desktop applications. These applications offer many benefits over traditional fat client applications.</p><p>Traditional web applications also known as Web 1.0 use a client-server model. The client, a web browser, issues an http request to a server for a new page when the user clicks on a link. The web server, usually Apache or IIS, does some processing, retrieves information from legacy systems, does some crunching, and sends a formatted page of hypertext back to the client for display. This approach is the simplest technically, but does not make much sense from the user perspective. The reason for this is the latency, one to ten seconds, between when the user requests the page and when it finally loads. Because of this latency it is not possible to use direct manipulation user interfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This class of user interface is greatly preferred by users <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The new model enabled by a set of technologies that are broadly called Web 2.0 eliminates the start-stop-start-stop nature of web applications. Instead, information is asynchronously downloaded to the browser using XML. JavaScript code in the browser caches this information when it is received from the server and displays it upon user request. Since the information is cached locally, the system can provide instantaneous responses and thereby support direct manipulation operations. JavaScript code in the browser handles interactions such as panning, zooming, scaling, and data validation. The advantage of the asynchronous requests for XML data is that users can continue working with the application's responsive user interface without losing their focus on the screen while data is downloading.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">GEOBOOST SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE</head><p>The GeoBoost system architecture is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. GeoBoost servers ingest geospatial raster data, feature data, and business data from a wide variety of common data sources and then transform the imagery and data sources into protocols formats that GeoBoost thin client components can accept, image tiles and RSS, and perform database and other services for GeoBoost applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Server Layer</head><p>The problem these servers are solving involves restrictions in the thin client programming model. Thin client code written in JavaScript has no access to databases, is restricted by security rules, and cannot maintain information from page to page as the user navigates through a site. These operations must be enabled using support from various other services.</p><p>The AJAX JavaScript and browser programming model enables two types of operations. First, web page issue asynchronous image requests by assigning a url to image src tags. As the images are retrieved, the browser automatically renders them on the page.</p><p>Second, it is possible to request XML files asynchronously which the JavaScript may use to manipulate the web page. With this approach the servers do the heavy lifting. It is more efficient to do protocol conversions, calculations, and as much computation as possible on servers rather than within the client.</p><p>GeoBoost provides two types of servers. Image Services stream image tiles, either drawn from image repositories or created by rendering feature data as image tiles, to the client. Application Services stream XML to the client. The XML is usually formatted RSS, a simple XML protocol, or RSS namespace extensions. As mentioned above, the problem that Image Services imagery and Application Services solves for raw data involves thin client computational limitations.</p><p>Browser-based code written in JavaScript is severely limited and it is not possible to do many computations that are easily done in fat-client or applet code.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">GeoBoost Web 2.0 AJAX Client</head><p>The GeoBoost thin client layer is a Web 2.0 AJAX client and includes a development environment consisting of a set of visual components for building web-based graphical applications. Using a common data infrastructure, these components ingest image and RSS data and provide visualization and collaboration services. To make these components easier to use for non-programmers, GeoBoost provides JSP and ASPX tags that enable the visual components to be readily used on web sites.</p><p>GeoBoost's second client is a Windows Mobile application that ingests image tiles, feature data, and uses services provide by GeoBoost Servers for tracking. The application is aimed at GeoSpatial tracking, alerting, and collaboration involving mobile devices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Application Layer</head><p>Using the GeoBoost platform, we have built a series of vertical applications focused around geospatial problems. The first application, called FUSION, focuses on Air Traffic Management and display plan positions, restricted airspace, and weather patterns.</p><p>The second application shows the positions of employees and company assets wearing RFID-tagged badges within a building.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">GEOBOOST VISUAL COMPONENTS</head><p>GeoBoost provides a broad set of visual components that includes maps, business charts, networks and graphs, trees and hierarchical displays, and a timeline. Each of these components has been developed using the thinc Interface framework, described below, and, when wrapped with the appropriate HTML code, may be independently positioned and moved on the browser screen. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> for examples of the standard business chart components.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">GeoBoost Graph Visualization</head><p>GeoBoost's graph visualization, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref>, displays the nodes and links of a graph ingested from RSS. Being completely thin client, the graph is generated by JavaScript and displayed in the browser when new information arrives. The nodes, which are simply standard RSS items, are represented by any of several built in geometric shapes or custom icons as well as custom size. The edges, which are also RSS items, require only a from item id and to item id tag which correspond to the ids of the two connected nodes. The edges are drawn as connecting lines and have the ability to show direction by having an arrow pointing at the target node.</p><p>The graph has a robust set of functionality that allows user interaction and customization. It is capable of displaying the network as a radial or tree graph. In both drawing modes, the nodes and links have built in mouse events such as hovering to see a tooltip and right clicking for a menu of additional options. The graph also has the ability to zoom in or out for a closer look and pan by clicking and dragging the mouse. Labels for individual nodes are drawn on the graph for quick recognition of what RSS item is represented by a particular node. By default, the graph will find the minimum spanning tree of the network and use the middle item as the root node. However, any node can be specified as the root of the graph in order to see the relationships of that item more clearly. The graph allows dynamic changing of the root node by simply right clicking on an item and selecting the option to set as root. Tooltips for the graph may be text or images.</p><p>One issue for thin client programming is scalability. JavaScript is an interpreted language and is not particularly fast. We were pleasantly surprised with the performance of our graph drawing algorithms. The approximate time to layout and display a graph with 300 edges and 200 nodes on a standard laptop is approximately 1 second. Drawing labels increases the time by a factor of four. Interactive operations such as tooltips and selections are essentially instantaneous.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">GeoBoost Map Visualization Component</head><p>The GeoBoost Map is similar to Google's and Microsoft's thin client map components. It supports animated zooming and panning as well a number of different API functions that allow programmatic interaction with the Map. Multiple Maps can be synchronized together so that they pan and zoom at the same rate, which is used to create "Overview" Maps and "Magnification" Maps. Raster imagery can be ingested from OGC compliant sources (WMS and WFS) or from custom sources. Multiple raster sources can be "layered" on a Map and re-ordered to combine street maps and satellite imagery from different sources. In addition, the transparency of each raster source can be individually adjusted to allow other layers to show through.</p><p>Feature data is ingested using the GeoRSS, a standard that translates cleanly to other popular geospatial formats. The client includes many interfaces to allow real-time and historical data to be ingested and rendered incrementally, providing support for geospatial monitoring applications. A variety of styles can be applied in real time to feature data to encode meaning, including color, width, opacity, etc. The advantage of drawing each data item as a vector feature is that the item is able to be highlighted and selected in an intuitive way. The Map supports sweep selection and, as is common in linked view visualization systems, highlighted items in on visual component propagate automatically to other linked Maps and visualizations (Timelines, Bar Graphs, Pie Graphs, etc) which are displaying the same data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">GeoBoost Time Line and TimeWheel</head><p>GeoBoost Timeline, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref> (top), is an interactive visualization that plots events on a timeline. Like the Map, the Timeline supports dynamic zooming and panning so the user can scroll through time and find data. The Timeline supports six different scales (Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second) and several different drawing modes (Circles, Ticks, Spheres, Custom Icons) and is easy to configure and customize. Another unique feature is its ability to plot data according to a specified property along the Y axis rather than using the default "Best Fit" algorithm, which essentially turns the Timeline into an interactive Line Chart with Time as the X axis. Timeline events support tooltips and can be highlighted or selected, which will cause the events to propagate to other linked visualizations. The timelines are synchronized with the top timeline providing an overview and the bottom more details.</p><p>TimeWheel is an interactive visualization that plots temporal data according to time of day and day of week. It is useful for identifying repeating patterns in data, particularly when the data is correlated with position on a map. The TimeWheel is shaped like a clock with each segment representing a different hour of the day. Concentric rings are labeled to designate a different day of the week. Once the data items are plotted, it is very easy to select or highlight clumped data items that meet certain criteria ("All data that occurred on Saturdays and Sundays between 9:00 and 12:00" or "All data that occurred on Fridays at 10:00pm"). In addition, the segments can be drawn equally or can be drawn proportional to the number of items that occurred in that slice (hour of the day). This provides a simple means of volume analysis to determine which hours of the day represent the most activity. A day/night layer can be added to the TimeWheel to show which hours of the day represent daytime and which represent nighttime so that it becomes obvious whether data items occurred during the day or night.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">GeoBoost Portal</head><p>GeoPortal, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref>, is an AJAX-enabled portal site for customized workflow. It enables users to include widgets. Widgets are, of course, just web pages that are included via a simple interface. Widgets developers may use the GeoBoost visualization libraries to create a consistent view of data through multiple displays. GeoPortal content widgets are stored in a Ruby on Rails backend which maintains user preferences, manages data feeds, and provides the logic required to include content.</p><p>In a simple use case, a user might display information from a data feed in several ways by including bar-chart, line-chart, and geospatial widgets on a single page. Additional tabs can be added to the display to allow the user to build situation-specific applications designed to include only the information necessary to the task at hand. These applications can then be made public for dissemination to others working in the same area. Simple collaboration features built into the Ruby on Rails backend allow users working on the same application to share information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">JAVASCRIPT VISUALIZATION FRAMEWORK</head><p>GeoBoost visual components are built using a JavaScript AJAX visualization framework that we call thinc Interface. The framework uses the browser's native rendering layer, SVG currently and in the future WPF/E (Windows Presentation Foundation Everywhere or XAML), for building thin client visualizations. In contrast to open source efforts such as DOJO <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref>, Prototype <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref> and Microsoft's Atlas <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref> that focus on user interface components, our focus is on visualization. The SVG graphics API that thinc uses is a W3C standard that is natively supported by many browsers including Firefox.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">RSS and GeoRSS Data Ingest</head><p>Each of these components ingests data to be displayed based upon RSS and namespace extensions of RSS that provide the components with specialized information. RSS is a simple protocol for publishing information. The basic content of an RSS stream is a set of metadata tags organized into items that describe content. The required tags in each item are &lt;title&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, &lt;description&gt;, &lt;pubDate&gt;, &lt;guid&gt;. The &lt;link&gt; tag is generally a hyperlink to retrieve the item content.</p><p>GeoRSS extends RSS by adding location information. The location may be a point, e.g. &lt;georss:point&gt;45.256 -71.92&lt;/georss:point&gt;, or more complex polygon. We have extended the GeoRSS specification to add specific shapes of interest such as ellipses, sectors, and slices using a thinc namespace extension. For example, the specification &lt;georss:where&gt; &lt;thincml:sector center="38.82, -77.12" radius="4000" insideradius="3000" startangle="90" arcangle="45"/&gt; &lt;/georss:where&gt; represents a sector of a circle or a pie wedge if the inside radius is zero.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Linking Between Visual Components</head><p>RSS organizes information into sets of items within a channel. Each GeoBoost visual component has the capability to ingest RSS feeds and display the information using its own visual metaphor. Our Map Components, for example, display GeoRSS by geopositioning entities in the browser over a map. Tooltips and other mouse operations are automatically linked among different visual components showing the same item sets. This approach toward visual components makes it easy to create rich visual applications built around RSS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Supporting Multiple Browser Graphics APIs</head><p>Rendering 2D vector graphics in a web browser is challenging for many reasons. Lack of IDE support for JavaScript makes it difficult to debug and step through the JavaScript code needed to render vector graphics that manipulate the browser's DOM (document object model). In addition, cross-browser coding is even more difficult because all browsers do not support the same type of vector graphics. At the current time, the latest browser releases of Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Safari all have native support for SVG, which is a W3C standard for vector graphics. However, Microsoft Internet Explorer supports VML natively, which is a similar vector graphics library designed by Microsoft. By using a plug-in, Microsoft Internet Explorer can also support SVG documents that are included through the use of an "embed" or "object" tag. The current varying state of vector graphics capability between common browsers introduces substantial complexity for the typical web developer who typically just needs to do simple things like drawing points, circles, rectangles, or other polygons.</p><p>The thinc Graphics classes and API solve this problem by abstracting the details of programming against the individual browsers and allow the web developer to program against a single graphics API.</p><p>The thinc Graphics classes interrogate the browser's rendering environment at run-time to determine the vector graphics it supports, and then conditionally execute the appropriate JavaScript code to create the vector objects. For example, a user browsing with Firefox to a page that had been created with the thinc Graphics classes would see the native SVG that the code generated. However, a user browsing to the same page with Internet explorer would see SVG in an embed tag if they had a plug-in that supported SVG otherwise, the thinc Graphics classes would fall back to generating the native VML that is supported in Internet Explorer. Of course, this behavior can be overridden by the developer to force specific rendering engines to be used. This approach allows a web developer to make simple calls to the API such as "DrawRectangle" or "DrawCircle" and not be concerned with the specifics of each browser's rendering capability. The thinc Graphics classes provide this layer of abstraction and make it much easier for the developer to use native vector graphics in their application. In addition, this model is flexible and easy to extend so that when new browsers are released, the same application code should work without requiring any changes. New classes can be added to the underlying thinc Graphics code without changing the existing signature of any of the thinc Graphics API calls.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">JSP and ASPX Server Tags</head><p>GeoBoost exposes functionality to the integration developer through HTML server tags. Server tags allow the developer to define GeoBoost widgets inline using an HTML syntax rather than pure JavaScript code. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, HTML tags enable developers to use sophisticated visual components by simply including them on web pages.</p><p>For each of GeoBoost's visual components we have developed both JSP and ASPX custom HTML tags. For ASPX these tags are also referred to as ASPX .NET User Controls. The tags, which all start with &lt;thinc&gt;, provide a programming abstraction layer on top of the JavaScript library for html programmers. When processed by the web server, the &lt;thinc&gt; tags in the web page are converted to the corresponding JavaScript on the web server when the page is loaded.</p><p>The advantage of GeoBoost's HTML tag functionality is that it greatly simplifies authoring web pages. Developers can program against the JSP Custom Tags or .NET User Web Controls for fast integration into their application, or they can program directly against the JavaScript API for optimal flexibility. The tags are identical across platforms. Thus, a page created using JSP Custom Tags will run in the .NET environment, and vice versa. The tag library exploits HTML's inherent notion of containment, 'embedding' map data sources within a &lt;thinc:map /&gt; tag. In this way the complex underlying JavaScript is shielded from the end developer, enabling rapid prototyping and quick integration</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Benefits to End Developer</head><p>The HTML syntax is more readable and therefore more maintainable for the end developer. Server tags also allow IntelliSense and syntax checking when used in the standard programming environments Eclipse and Microsoft's Visual Studio. Integrating with the popular IDE's enables "Drag and Drop" support, allowing the developer to design and code the application using typical Rapid Application Development (RAD) techniques. Syntax errors are caught at integration time rather than during run time. GeoBoost Server Tags provide meaningful error messages for the integration developer. Regular HTML error messages provide only generic error messages and codes (for example, Error 500, Server Error), whereas GeoBoost server tags provide detailed error messages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.6</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hierarchy within Tags</head><p>Many of the GeoBoost widgets express a hierarchal relationship. For example the Map widget might contain 3 overlay regions which to display, or the BarChart widget might contain 3 data series to plot. Unique to GeoBoost, the server tag library expresses these relationships using XML's natural syntax, familiar to all developers. The standard way to express the relationship is by embedding ID's and using lookup indirection to deduce hierarchy. GeoBoost tags express this naturally, as in the following sample: &lt;thinc:map latitude="35.0" longitude="45.0"&gt; &lt;thinc:ItemCollection&gt; &lt;thinc:GeoRssDataConnector url="source1" /&gt; &lt;thinc:GeoRssDataConnector url="source2" /&gt; &lt;/thinc:ItemCollection&gt; &lt;/thinc:map&gt;</p><p>In the above sample code, a map is drawn centered at latitude 35, and longitude 45. Drawn in the map is the data from "source1" and "source2". This hierarchal relationship is clear from the code.</p><p>Using hierarchical containment, it is possible to include several different image and datasets into thinc components. For example, <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows an example where our Map control is attached to two different WMS image servers. Both sets of imagery are retrieved by the client and combined within the browser. The result is shown in Error! Reference source not found. where NASA imagery is combined with political boundaries by merging the images in the browser.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7">Annotating and Editing Visual Components</head><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref> GeoBoost provides the capability for users to edit and annotate the visualizations. The edits and annotations automatically propagate using AJAX messages and are persisted in GeoBoost's collaboration database. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref> two users of the Map component are simultaneously editing the map in different browsers. Each of the browsers polls the collaboration database every second or two and picks up any new changes. The result is that of a real-time geospatial wiki. The same capability may be used with any of GeoBoost's visual components.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">5. GEOBOOST MOBILE CLIENT</head><p>Screens on mobile devices are typically small, have differing orientations and dimensions, have varying pixel resolutions, and thus require special attention. Additionally, mobile devices typically have slower processors, minimal battery life, and constrained local storage. These factors must be weighed when integrating a mobile appliance into the GeoBoost platform. Creating a compelling mobile client requires careful consideration of all these constraints. To fully take advantage of mobile applications, the GeoBoost server platform has been extended to process and deliver data in new ways. By off-loading this processing to the server, the mobile device resources were conserved and the user experience was enhanced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Screen Resolutions and Aspect Ratios</head><p>Mobile devices have varying screen resolutions and physical dimensions. Some devices (notable the Palm Treo) have a square screen with a resolution of 320x320. Other smart-phones have rectangular dimensions, with orientations in both Landscape and Portrait. On the far end of the device scale, small handhelds have screen resolutions of 800x600 with a physical dimension of 5". A strategy of delivering "a standard set" of images to clients, and letting the mobile device handle the difference would be disastrous since the devices do not have the processing power required for intense image manipulation. Rather, GeoBoost server allows image manipulation to be done server side, and passing on images with resolution and dimensions specific to the device.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Processor Power, Battery Life</head><p>On a mobile device, battery life is directly proportional to processor power and processor workload. If we program the device to do heavy computations or image manipulation, we have a double effect on the device: slowing performance overall, and draining the battery. Battery life is at a premium on the devices, and manufactures are trying to increase the battery power by continually reducing the processor power. Recognizing this constraint, the GeoBoost server platform was extended to serve images "pre-cooked" for the specific device. This allows the device to simply display the map image, rather than needing to manipulate the image for its hardware.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Color Depth</head><p>Current mobile technology delivers limited color depth and typically only displays 24-bit color (as opposed to 32-bit color standard on a desktop). This limited GeoBoost's ability to finely calibrate data points on the map. GeoBoost server side changes were made to accommodate the reduced color depth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Glyph Size</head><p>Mobile devices are designed to be used within 5"-6" from the users eyes, whereas desktop monitors are 17" -25" from the eyes. Further, some handhelds are specifically designed with touch interfaces (the Windows Mobile platform), whereas others are designed for stylus use (TabletPC). Fingertip use requires bigger icons with larger hotspots to be activated, while with stylus use, a smaller hotspot is possible. Some mobile devices (Smart Phones) allow neither, and rely on the telephone input digits or joysticks (blackberry pearl) for input. GeoBoost Mobile has algorithms and tolerances defined to allow varying sized hotspots depending on device. The larger hotspots require larger icons, so icon collision detection algorithms are needed to space hotspots accordingly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5">GeoBoost Mobile Client Prototype</head><p>A prototype rich client was developed as proof points for our theories. The prototype consumed map images from GeoBoost server, and delivered them to the device to allow zooming, panning, and scrolling on the client. The architecture of our mobile application is similar to that of the GeoBoost client: a Model-View-Controller pattern is used to create several different interfaces to a single central data model. The mobile application connects to Map Services over the internet and fetches map tiles for the currently displayed area. Feature data is provided by Data and Application services in the form of GeoRss. The GeoRss is parsed by our RSS library and imported into the application's central data store. The application then uses its native graphics libraries to represent the feature data on the map.</p><p>Mobile applications are especially well suited for lowbandwidth or sporadic internet access. Since the application does not depend on a web browser, additional optimizations such as local tile caching can be introduced to counteract the limitations of the network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">DISCUSSION AND RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION</head><p>There are several significant contributions to this research. First, GeoBoost demonstrates that it is possible to build a linked view visualization system totally in JavaScript. This class of system, which includes for example Spotfire and Advizor, has been successful for visual analytics applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. It is well known how to build this type of system using traditional programming environments. However, to our knowledge, we are the first to create a linked view, cross-browser, visual analytics system using thin client technology. The reason this is so difficult is that the JavaScript programming environment is somewhat rough and quirky and must be supported by server software. Developers need to have solid JavaScript skills, the patience to sort through undocumented browser quirks, and ability to build sophisticated server software.</p><p>Second, mashups on Google Maps and Microsoft Live Maps have been phenomenally successful. Literally hundreds of thousands of mashup visualizations have been created. We had demonstrated that it is possible to build mashup-style applications using timelines, timewheels, and network displays. There is nothing special about map mashups. As we have shown, the same concept applies to other web visualization components. We have learned, however, that we must support open standards such as OGC and protocols such as RSS to enable developers to create rich mashup analytical applications.</p><p>Third, there are unexpected benefits by moving visual analytics toward a web environment. Web technology enables different styles of collaboration, wikis, and interactions that are complementary toward traditional visualization.</p><p>In our application, for example, we added real-time annotations that propagate with live updating. It is easier, for example, in a web application to support updating for real-time monitoring than in a traditional desktop application.</p><p>GeoBoost serves as a "proof point" that it is possible to build compelling lightweight visual analytics applications that are browser-based. It provides most, but not all, of the functionality in a heavyweight desktop client without all of the desktop software management complexity. There are many compelling reasons to build thin client applications. The gating factor limiting these applications has been that the programming models are difficult. By demonstrating that it is possible, we expect others to build lightweight visual analytics applications. We expect thin client applications to become the dominate way that visual analytics applications are delivered to users in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have created a Web 2.0 AJAX thin client mapping framework that we call GeoBoost™. Using our framework we are able to build browser-based geospatial applications that run on top of open geospatial standards, RSS and GeoRSS, and provide rich geospatial visualizations built using Scalable Vector Graphics. The framework is unique in that applications built using it have the richness of traditional desktop applications and the reach of browser-based systems. It provides an open platform for thin client web mapping.       Edits and annotations on the map and other visual components propagate using AJAX within a couple seconds.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>GeoBoost uses an open extensible architecture and supports relevant standards. GeoBoost is built around open standards such as GML (Geography Markup Language), RSS, GeoRSS and other RSS extensions. GeoBoost consumes imagery and feature data from both OGC compliant sources such as WMS (Web Mapping Service) and other native formats such as NGA's [3] RPF and LizardTech's [4] MrSID.</figDesc></figure>
