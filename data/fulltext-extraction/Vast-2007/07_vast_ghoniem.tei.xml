			<abstract>
				<p>In this paper, we introduce NewsLab, an exploratory visualization approach for the analysis of large scale broadcast news video collections containing many thousands of news stories over extended periods of time. A river metaphor is used to depict the thematic changes of the news over time. An interactive lens metaphor allows the playback of fine-grained video segments selected through the river overview. Multi-resolution navigation is supported via a hierarchical time structure as well as a hierarchical theme structure. Themes can be explored hierarchically according to their thematic structure, or in an unstructured fashion using various ranking criteria. A rich set of interactions such as filtering, drill-down/roll-up navigation, history animation, and keyword based search are also provided. Our case studies show how this set of tools can be used to find emerging topics in the news, compare different broadcasters, or mine the news for topics of interest.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In recent years, many countries in the world gained access to advanced communication technology such as telecommunication satellites and broadband internet. Since then, an ever increasing number of information channels has been made available to the public at large, and is also of interest to political and media analysts, business, and government. This overwhelming new surge of information begs for proper exploration and analysis tools, in order to provide useful insights and support decision making. In a globalized world, broadcast news constitutes a first-hand, realtime information window on global threats such as communicable disease outbreaks and spread, official discourse, and governmental propaganda related to local or global crises. On a national or international level, such tools can also be used to assess the full range of opinions with regards to events of interest such as national elections, regional or international trade activity, and myriad other events. At present, comprehensive exploratory visualization tools for large broadcast news video collections do not exist, and an investigator is forced to focus on a small subset of what is available, simply because there is neither time nor capability to organize and explore the whole broadcast news space.</p><p>Following the principles of the Visual Analytics Mantra <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> a variation of the oft-cited Information Visualization Mantra <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> adapted to visual analytics, we argue that the following requirements need to be met in order to support effective visual exploration and analysis of large broadcast video collections:</p><p>• provide a preprocessing/analysis mechanism of the entire news dataset to help cope with massive data;</p><p>• provide a visual overview of all important news stories; it is highly desirable to depict how the semantic contents change over time because the news is time-sensitive.</p><p>• provide a mechanism to zoom, filter out common sense, uninteresting, knowledge from the news collection, and retain the news stories of potential interest to the user for further interactive analysis and exploration;</p><p>• provide support for the management, recall, and exchange of findings, e.g. news stories for repeated usage, sharing, or collaborative analysis.</p><p>Towards these goals, we developed NewsLab, an approach built on the close coupling of state-of-the-art analysis tools and interactive visualization techniques. The resulting new capability permits the analysis of thousands of hours of news video from many channels over extended periods of time, altogether comprising multiple terabytes of multimedia information. In this paper, we will focus on the visualization and interaction aspects of our approach. Details of the underlying analysis technique can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in section 3, we set the stage by describing the dataset used in this work and the main requirements a news analysis system needs to support. In section 4, we describe the main components of NewsLab (NewsRiver and LensRiver) and how they relate to each other. In section 5, we describe the interactive exploration capabilities shipped with these views. Then, in section 6, we present two use cases showing NewsLab at work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>As part of NIST TRECVID research, several tools have focused on the display of search queries results <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and storyboarding <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Most provide visual summaries such as collage-based interfaces. Several other commercial or research systems exist, but few of them could fulfill the need for interactive exploration of large broadcast news video collections with the focus on thematic changes over time.</p><p>Several papers have previously studied thematic evolution over time. The ThemeRiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> visualization uses a river metaphor to visualize changes in trends and patterns in a collection of topics over time. Each topic contributes a stream to the overall information river. Each stream is materialized by a 2D colored stripe, whose height varies according to a measure of strength of the corresponding topic, while the time line flows horizontally from left to right. This visualization is used along with user annotations, to correlate evolution patterns with known events. The work presented here is based on the same metaphor but significantly extends it by considering denser sets of themes over long periods of times so that hierarchical structures, concept networks, and other techniques are important. It also integrates tightly with analyses, particularly applied to video, which require handling and display of multiple streams of information.</p><p>The NameVoyager <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> wizard uses a similar approach to visualize the evolution of given names since 1880. It uses two colors to encode gender and provides additional information about each name on the fly, such as the name's rank at any point in time. It also supports gender-and query-based filtering, such that the user can display data relative to either or both genders, and perform name lookups. In both ThemeRiver and NameVoyager, the streams comprised in the river are stacked on top of each other. In Themeriver, cubic interpolators are used to produce the stream shapes, whereas linear interpolators are used in NameVoyager. Our system supports both types of interpolation.</p><p>TagLines <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> examines the evolution of tagged content over time such as in Flickr images. The font size of labels reflects the importance of the corresponding tag. This system uses a river metaphor to display the most prominent tags in rows; each tag traverses the screen from right to left and eventually disappears as time goes by. TagLines also features a waterfall visualization where tags are also displayed in rows. As time passes, new tags replace older ones in the top-most ranking. Persistent tags over several consecutive days keep their position on the screen in order to preserve the user's mental map. Neither metaphors provide a global overview of all tags over time.</p><p>Our LensRiver approach is inspired by the DragMag image magnifier <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, where a base image is shown with lines connecting regions of this image to magnified images of these regions. In our approach, we use rubber lines to connect a region of interest (in theme and time) in the river view to a lens that plays back a representative video of that region.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PROBLEM STATEMENT AND REQUIREMENTS</head><p>We are interested in exploratory analysis of broadcast video news channels from around the world. In this section, we will describe the data used in this work and the user requirements for an analysis approach such as NewsLab.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data Preprocessing</head><p>We use news reports collected over the past months from several broadcast channels, including dedicated 24/7 news channels, from the USA and Asia. The data collected includes video/audio content as well as closed caption text when available. The data are then automatically analyzed and segmented into stories. Each story is assigned a weight, between 0 and 1, proportional to its interestingness. More information concerning the segmentation process and measures of interestingness can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In this initial work, we assume that closed captioning information is available. However, even without closed captions, degraded scenarios can be worked out using content extraction capabilities from the video stream, similar to the feature extraction presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In fact, the story segmentation is good enough that in the future we expect to be able to identify story content without closed captions.</p><p>NewsLab takes in the analyses from the aforementioned data sources (video + audio + captions + segmentation data) and combines them into interactive visualizations, supporting an end-to-end exploration from high level abstract overviews down to specific video segments with interesting content. To this end, we record all non-trivial keywords and maintain a full history of occurrence timestamps for each. Thus the visual analysis goes well beyond the interestingness criterion above, and it becomes possible to tell when and how often topics or keywords have appeared in the news. It is also possible to look at distribution patterns and correlation between topics over time (See section 4 for further details).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">User Requirements</head><p>We take investigative reporters as our prototypical users since they are representative of many different investigators. The availability of a large repository of broadcast news videos offers a broad scope of tasks for this type of user to perform. These range from the general and exploratory to the specific and focused. The tasks include overall awareness of topics discussed in the news and hot topic detection, comparing and contrasting what is being discussed locally and nationally, study of differing opinions on events from different news sources, and searching for news on well-identified topics of interest. The overwhelming amount of data does not allow any investigator, or even team of investigators, to watch all news reports in order to get the desired insight for a decision-making process. Therefore, visual analytics tools are required to take up the challenging mission of helping the user explore this multitude of stories until a small subset of highly relevant stories, or segments of stories, are identified for further scrutiny. As the user sees temporal and structural patterns in the data, his attention will often evolve gradually towards a more focused investigative task. After evidence is gathered and evaluated, an argument can be shaped and presented for decision making purposes.</p><p>We present two main scenarios that encompass the above tasks. Despite the formal distinction between these two scenarios, it must be understood that an exploratory investigation usually iterates through a continuum of views from overview to detail and back.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">News Monitoring</head><p>In absence of a specific focus, the investigator can be interested in the following categories of questions:</p><p>• Situation awareness: What is being discussed in the news?</p><p>What are the most prominent topics?</p><p>• Temporal trends, or topic dynamics: Which topics are emerging and can they be associated with events in the world or in the community? Which are fading away?</p><p>• Structural patterns: Which topics are related to each other?</p><p>These questions can bear on a collection of news broadcasts for a more or less extended period of time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Detailed News Analysis</head><p>Another set of tasks is more relevant to query-driven investigation including the following categories of questions:</p><p>• Evidence gathering: What do the media report concerning such and such event, person, location, time?</p><p>• Standpoints assessment: What are the different standpoints worldwide concerning such crisis, event, or threat?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">NEWSLAB DESCRIPTION</head><p>In order to support the aforementioned requirements, we developed NewsLab with two main visualization components. The first is a NewsRiver overview (top half of figures 1 and 2) showing the ebb and flow of ordered themes and associated keywords over any time scale while supporting zoom-in to reveal further thematic details for any time period, as well as interactive display of keyframes exctracted on the fly from the videos. The second component is LensRiver ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3</ref>) which is built on a hierarchical theme organization permitting drill-down and roll-up on any set of themes and sub-themes. At any time, the user can place a lens in any point in a theme stream to reveal the most representative video at that point in time. These two components complement each other to do exploration, discovery, and detailed analysis. The NewsRiver overview provides context while being especially good at showing emerging or disappearing themes at any level, where events that motivate the news are likely to occur, and what are the overall trends in news reporting for a given time period (which can be quite different from channel to channel). Typically an investigator would first use News-River and then concentrate on a certain set of themes for a certain time range using LensRiver. At this point he would place lenses at precise points in themes and time, running multiple video streams for detailed content analysis and comparison. Both visualization components are necessary for a complete and efficient investigation of news, as shown in the case studies. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">NewsRiver Multi-Scale Overview</head><p>The underlying automated analysis provides many thousands of stories, located in time, with keywords and themes. One can use all this to effectively visualize the daily flow of the top or most interesting stories <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. But this doesn't scale up to exploratory capabilities for many thousands of stories and hundreds of themes over extended periods of time.</p><p>To provide scalability and follow topic changes over time, we developed a ThemeRiver TM -like <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> overview visualization, extended with new interactive capability and hierarchical, multi-scale structure, as in the top-half of figure 1. This visualization maps the news to a river where each topic occupies a stream flowing from left to right as time elapses. In figure 1, we use the word count as a measure of thematic strength (encoded by the height of the associated streams). Topic strength variations for a collection of topics can be visualized in a discrete mode as a stacked histograms plot, or in a smoothed mode by interpolating the histograms into a stack of smoothed curves. Since continuity plays a key role in the user's ability to follow curves, NewsLab provides a smoothed NewsRiver visualization using cubic interpolation, besides stacked histogram plots. To avoid misleading the user, we compute cubic interpolators that don't overshoot nor undershoot around actual data points.</p><p>Like major map services in the geographic arena, we provide multi-scale views of news information. On the X-axis, we compute a time hierarchy on the video segments identified during the automated video preprocessing, so that the data can be aggregated and explored at various levels of granularity over time. For instance, depending on the size of the dataset the user may wish to aggregate the data by hour (see figure 2), day (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 1)</ref>, week, month, year or any multiple or divider of these scales. While aggregation is straight forward for additive numerical attributes such as word count, more careful thought is required with regard to the semantic of aggregation in relation to categorical data and non additive numerical attributes such as interestingness.</p><p>To help the user identify temporal patterns, the time dimension (the X-axis) is materialized by a background filled with two-color stripes over which the NewsRiver is laid. The width of each stripe represents a user-controlled time period such as a day (as in figure 1), an hour etc. As the granularity of data aggregation and the observation time window vary, the user may adjust the granularity of the time scale or allow the system to adjust it automatically.</p><p>The NewsRiver provides a good overview of the selected topics as they inflate or fade away. The user can also appreciate the overall shape of the river at a glance and locate theme shifts (figure 1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">A Linear Ranking-Based Theme Organization</head><p>NewsRiver adopts an unstructured approach to news topics. This is achieved by ranking each topic according to a strength measure such as word count; the corresponding streams in the NewsRiver are then stacked accordingly. In figure 1, the top 30 topics/streams are ranked according to their decreasing word count from top to bottom. Depending on the selected strength measure, various sets of streams will find their way up in the river lending themselves more easily to the user's attention and interaction.</p><p>Since there is no natural order for news topics, NewsLab supports several alternate orders applicable to all subscribing views. Via the table component displayed in the control panel on the right handside in figure 1, the visible streams can be sorted against any column: alphabetically, or according to the word count (the column containing the colored histograms in the table), or according to any other statistical measure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Color Assignment</head><p>The use of color can be very challenging with large sets of categorical data as the human eye can only distinguish a limited number of colors (about eight colors <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>), notwithstanding color interactions due to adjacency of data items. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> displays the top 30 non trivial keywords occurring on CNN in a 24-day period out of a rough total of 40,000 words. With such a large number of categories, color repetition is inevitable. Taking advantage of the Col-orBrewer online tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, NewsLab integrates 8 categorical color schemas of 7 colors each. The user can decide to cycle through all 56 available colors or repeat one color schema across all topics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Topic Animation</head><p>Thanks to the fine-grained history maintained for each keyword, NewsLab supports time brushing either directly by rubber-banding on the NewsRiver or interactively via the rangeslider controlling the observation time window in the "Time control" panel (figure 2). The observation time window is fully controllable by the user. It can be resized and dragged from one extremity to the other of the total timespan in a mobile mode, or be used in a growing mode where its start time is locked and its end time increases until it reaches its maximum extent. As the user modifies the observation window, he can follow the topics as they flow across the screen and see their strength increase or decrease. New topics will emerge, others will vanish completely, and some topics will surge provisionally before falling back into a flatter trend. A row of control buttons allows the user to animate this process automatically in a step by step or continuous fashion while he focuses on tracking the thematic changes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.4">NewsRings Complementary View</head><p>The bottom half of figure 1 displays a ring visualization of the news topics. Time flows clockwise starting from the North position. Each ring represents a news topic whose color is identical to its color in the NewsRiver. The topics are laid out in the same sequence as in the NewsRiver from the periphery towards the center. Currently, the ring breadth does not encode any information. Hence, we give the user the choice to give each ring an equal breadth as in figure 2, or to normalize the breadth so that all rings have the same area as in figure 1. Both choices prove to be biased: an equal breadth makes the peripheral rings stand out and leaves the inner ones with little screen real-estate, while the normalized area setting combined with the centrality of user focus puts much emphasis on the inner rings.</p><p>Like the NewsRiver, the NewsRings materialize time as a twocolor series of wedges in the background. This is particularly useful to see emerging topics/keywords as they occur for the first time (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">figure 5(a)</ref>). The background pattern is also effective at finding correlated keywords as they start and end synchronously (figure 5(c)). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> displays the top 30 topics in the first week of August 2006 on CNN aggregated hourly. On the NewsRings view, one can see very clearly that closed caption text is unavailable every day, roughly between 2 AM and 5 AM. Thus temporal patterns can be exhibited using this view and this is made more legible thanks to the background pattern. Similar observations can be made on the related NewsRiver. As a side note, one may also spot Larry King's night program pattern displayed in red (see the spots circled in black on figure 2). This demonstrates how prominent patterns arise naturally from the unstructured data analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">LensRiver: context + detail approach</head><p>Like NewsRiver, LensRiver (figure 3) uses a river metaphor to display thematic changes over time. While NewsRiver considers all keywords occurring in the closed captions, LensRiver considers the most important keywords listed by the automated preprocessing phase. These keywords are organized hierarchically, allowing the user to explore the cluster hierarchy at the desired level of detail, with direct access to the most relevant video segments for any given topic and time, as we shall describe shortly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">A Hierarchical Theme Organization and Coloring</head><p>LensRiver provides a clustering algorithm that builds a hierarchy over all keywords taken into consideration based on their cooccurrences in the news stories. The algorithm builds a distance matrix capturing the correlations between keywords <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> and uses the minimal spanning tree algorithm for agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Strongly correlated topics are grouped into the same clusters or sub-clusters, while loosely related or unrelated topics are set apart in different clusters. Then an anti-chain, or set partition of clusters in the tree, is selected according to a user-controlled level-of-detail threshold and region of focus using a structure based brushing approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Each selected cluster is visualized as a stream whose strength amounts to the sum of the interestingness of all news stories containing any of the topics within the cluster. The interestingness measure is used rather than a simple count of matching news stories to emphasize the most interesting themes.</p><p>In the LensRiver, closely related themes are placed close to each other following a linear depth-first traversal of the topic cluster tree. Consequently, clusters with common ascendants, i.e., closely related thematic clusters, are close to each other in the river. However, at cluster boundaries, it is not guaranteed that clusters having the same parent will be closer to each other than adjacent clusters with different parents in this linear order. To avoid confusion, LensRiver enforces a loose stacking strategy by inserting a gap between distinct streams whose breadth is proportional to the structural distance in the cluster hierarchy. In this approach, a hierarchical color schema <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> is used to display the topic cluster hierarchy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Multi-Resolution Navigation</head><p>In LensRiver, users can interactively change the levels of detail of the displayed clusters or perform semantic zoom by dynamically drilling-down or rolling up between consecutive levels of detail in the topic hierarchy. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3(a)</ref>, this is illustrated by the fact that topics such as "Cuba" and "Florida" appear in the same cluster. With a finer level of detail as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3(b)</ref>, they are split into two adjacent streams. Likewise, the large cluster at the bottom of the river <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(figure 3(a)</ref>) corresponds to international events and breaks down into two separate sub-streams, concerning the Cuban president's health problems and the war in Lebanon. These clusters arise naturally from the unstructured analysis in NewsRiver.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Video Playback in LensRiver</head><p>Direct access to the video data is provided through media lenses laid out above and beneath the topic river. These lenses correspond to small media player windows and are used to play on demand interesting video segments. This approach is motivated by the generally elongated shape of the river, allowing the placement of detail windows above and beneath the river to make full use of the screen (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3)</ref>.</p><p>Each lens is linked to a lightweight handle by a rubber line. The user can drag a lens handle and hover on the river streams. As soon as the hovering is paused, a tooltip pops up and shows the topics related to the underlying stream. If the user is interested in a given theme and point in time, he can drop the lens handle at that location. The news story with the highest interestingness related to the selected topic and time is played back in the lens. The lens is labeled at the top left corner using the corresponding topics. One can also watch the same news story in a bigger window, with timealigned closed captions by double-clicking the lens.</p><p>Users can interactively set the number of lenses around the river. By default, eight lenses are placed around the LensRiver for the user to watch and compare several stories concurrently. When multiple news stories are playing, all but the one opened most recently are muted, in order to follow the user's focus. The lenses come with all standard media control buttons such as play, pause and mute.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">INTERACTIVE EXPLORATION</head><p>NewsLab components come with a variety of interaction techniques to support the exploration of a feature rich data repository like broadcast news videos. The interaction capabilities concern various navigation capabilities such as semantic zoom, context+details visualization, topic reordering and animation, as described previously, as well as various filtering options.</p><p>Given that a large number of stories and topics are discussed in the news (50,000 keywords per month on CNN), and since not every story is interesting to everyone nor can every story be studied in detail, a visual exploratory tool needs to support filtering techniques such as dynamic queries <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Interestingness-Based Filtering</head><p>As mentioned earlier, the video analysis automatically segments each video document into coherent stories with a measure of interestingness assigned to each. We allow the user to filter out footage falling beneath a certain level of interestingness. In LensRiver <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(figure 3(b)</ref>), uninteresting stream segments are dimmed out so that the user can focus on the remaining data items for further investigation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Lexical Filtering</head><p>In order to bridge the gap between the system's appreciation of what may be deemed interesting and what the user actually thinks is interesting, NewsRiver supports query driven exploration. The user can enter one or several keywords he wants to include or exclude from the display and have the display adapt accordingly. Any requirement that can be captured by a regular expression can serve as an input to such a query. A more user-friendly GUI will eventually be provided to express such queries. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows a user query bearing on avian flu during August 2007 in African countries such as Egypt. One can see a direct correlation between keywords like "Egypt" (in pink), "flu" (in beige), "bird" (top red stream), and "virus" (in dark green). The keywords can be fed in manually by the user as in this example, or seeded by the user and completed by the system via multi-dimensional analysis of keywords. Intuitive input and fast response are essential for these exploratory forays. LensRiver also allows the user to filter the river using preselected keywords, retaining all streams related to that keyword. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3(c)</ref>, the LensRiver clusters were filtered using the query "Jonbenet Ramsey".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Time Filtering</head><p>NewsRiver supports time filtering in two different ways. Firstly, the user can rubber-band on the NewsRiver and set a user-defined observation window. This can also be achieved through a range slider as discussed previously. Secondly, the user can filter topics occurring or not in a certain time period. The time period can be defined in an absolute manner or via a recurring pattern, e.g. topics discussed in morning editions, say from 6 AM to 8 AM, as this is when the American news broadcasters catch up with international events happening on the same day.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Statistical Filtering</head><p>Likewise, most keywords present in the news stories are frequent words in the spoken language. Only a small portion of them can be discarded as part of a stopwords preprocessing mechanism. The remaining majority will then have to be examined in their context. For instance, the word "test" may occur often in the spoken language. But it gains a significant momentum in certain contexts such as the nuclear test in Korea, or the paternity test of a disputed wealthy baby heir. Likewise, names like "John" are very common. But the surge in the corresponding stream in figure 5(a) in conjunction with the name "Karr" does refer to a prominent piece of news that was discussed for a full week on all national news media. (The event was John Karr's confession to the JonBenet Ramsey murder, which was later discounted. JonBenet and Ramsey were ranked close to John and Karr in the theme stream.) Likewise, the word "security" is omnipresent in the news, but from August 10 to August 15 this The question then becomes: how can we effectively separate frequent topics or words from topics or words that are part of an important piece of news? We observe empirically and it makes sense that hot topics always have a fairly large surge that lasts for a more or less long period above their overall average level. Such information on the distribution profile could be captured by the standard deviation of the word count for any given topic. However, since standard deviation has the same order of magnitude as data samples, it cannot be used to compare populations with different scales. We therefore use a more suitable measure of dispersion of population distributions around their mean value, which is the coefficient of variation</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C v = σ µ ,</formula><p>where σ is the standard deviation of the population and µ is the mean value. This indicator expresses the dispersion in percentage and makes it possible to compare topics with different levels of activity. It must however be emphasized that this indicator becomes irrelevant for populations with low mean-values.</p><p>Hot topics are not the only items of interest; one can apply dynamic filtering or comparative analysis to bring out other themes of interest. NewsLab supports dynamic query-based filtering on coefficient of variation figures as well as word count figures. Other statistics can be computed and used for filtering in a similar fashion in an attempt to filter out uninteresting topics. Our preliminary observations lead us to believe that keywords with significant word count aggregated daily and having a coefficient of variation less than about 40% (see the dashed line in figure 6(b)) are common words that can be filtered out, while those showing a dispersion exceeding roughly 300% are often uninteresting and coincide with topics in commercials. Since the smoothing effect of aggregation is stronger at higher levels of aggregation, these percentages are function of the scale. Further computational experience need to be gained to fully understand the interaction between all statistical indicators we might apply. However, this holds the promise of permitting the setting of default values for filters to initially cull likely uninteresting topics (with easy override by the user).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CASE STUDIES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Comparative Analysis of Broadcasters</head><p>We used NewsLab for a retrospective study of the news from August 1 to August 24, 2006, and carried out a comparative analysis between different broadcasters in that period, namely CNN, FoxNews and MSNBC. For any one broadcaster, one month worth of information amounts to an average of 50,000 unique words, barring all trivial stopwords of the English language. In the following, we will explain how NewsLab allowed us to find the most prominent stories in that period. We will point out visual patterns that characterize prominent news, how emerging themes can be discovered, and discuss the way interactive exploration helps separate secondary important topics from noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1">Overview of the Most Frequent Topics</head><p>Initially, NewsLab ranks the words according to their count throughout the observation period. This is based on the assumption that prominent news topics are repeated a lot. Then the user is presented with a NewsRiver view of the top N words. By default, NewsRiver shows the top 30 words count-wise, giving the user the ability to change the number of visible words to possibly include all words present in the dataset. In figures 5(a) and 5(b), one can see that the war in Lebanon was the main story in the news. In the first two weeks of August, this story took up about 50% of the bandwidth dedicated to the top 30 topics on all channels. Starting from August 16, the bandwidth taken by this story reduced drastically, which reflects visually as a big drop in the width of the river in figures 5(a) and 5(b). Indeed, a cease fire agreement was reached between the belligerents on the 14 th . The news broadcasters then shifted their attention permanently to other themes. Interestingly, this pattern can be seen on CNN and FoxNews, but does not appear on MSNBC. We account for that by a difference in style between broadcasters. While CNN and FoxNews focused greatly on the war, MSNBC provided a more balanced coverage of other news topics in that period ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">figure 5(c)</ref>).</p><p>Indeed, within the top 30 words, one can identify four important stories on MSNBC (the war, the murder of Jonbenet Ramsey, the race of Joe Lieberman for the senate, and a security plot), while in comparison the two other channels show the first two stories only. This analysis also demonstrates that NewsRiver clearly shows the highly dynamic nature of the news streams, how themes can emerge and subside, and that quantitative comparisons can be made. Likely events can be indicated by the dynamic patterns, too, and analysis of the keywords give strong clues to what the events are.</p><p>It is worth noting that a dedicated 24/7 news channel is comparable to a constant bandwidth pipeline. In order to allocate air time to new stories, broadcasters have to cut down the time allocated to older stories. With this analogy in mind, the user is compelled by the sudden bandwidth drop that appears on August 10 on CNN and FoxNews. This phenomenon coincides with an inflation of the "security" stream, visible on CNN. Cross-checking with MSNBC, one finds another inflating stream in the same period: "plot".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2">Interactive Exploratory Analysis</head><p>In order to learn more about this "security plot", one needs to dig further down in the word list, beyond the top 30 words. Looking at the top 140 words (figure 6(a)), the NewsRiver starts looking like a Napoleon pastry. Nevertheless, the user can still identify major events by their visual signature. In fact, when a major event occurs, several streams in the NewsRiver will surge at the same time. This results in a strong ascending line pattern that the human observer picks up immediately. Hovering on the surging streams of the ascending pattern, the user finds words like "British", "airport", "qaeda", "terror", "oil", "liquid", "London", "Heathrow", "United", "States" etc. (This event refers to a major security plot uncovered by the British police against airplanes involving the use of gel and oily liquids.) Some of these topics are omnipresent in the news (like "Unites States"), while others occurred only in that specific time frame. Their surging pattern of activity that starts and ends synchronously brings them together. This contributes to the formation of a salient visual pattern visible in the NewsRiver despite the unstructured manner in which topics are approached; it also indicates that the stories are probably related. Other important stories can now be spotted such as "Castro" and "Cuba" referring to the recent health problems of Fidel Castro (figure 6(a)).</p><p>Furthermore, statistical dispersion measures can be used to reorder and filter the NewsRiver so as to separate noise from interesting stories. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>(b) shows a NewsRiver displaying the top 1,100 words on CNN. The river was reordered so that words with higher dispersion values appear on the bottom. From left to right (see the outlined regions), the user hovers on the following stories at the bottom of the NewsRiver: On August 1-2: Fidel Castro's health situation; on Aug. 5-7: Floyd Landis the winner of the tour de France as well as a sub-story of the war in Lebanon involving  <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>(c) shows the same information after filtering words whose dispersion is smaller than 40% (see the dashed line across figure6(b)). In the future, the color sequence will be preserved before and after the filtering. Common words appear at the top of the NewsRiver with small dispersions. They can be considered as omnipresent noise that occur at the same levels of intensity with little variation over time. In this category, the user finds words like "reporter" and "people" (see figure 6(b)), which are high frequency words, as well as common but less frequent words such as "live", "fact", "news", "CNN" among other trivial words. It is then up to the user to filter out or retain words having certain dispersion and/or count levels using dynamic queries, or to search for specific words using lexical filtering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Study of the Elections</head><p>In this case study, we examine the news from September 1 to November 20, 2006. We use data from CNN and MSNBC in order to grasp the most important topics as they emerge over an 80 day period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1">Comparative vs. Complementary Analysis</head><p>The overview of the top 30 topics discussed on MSNBC show a flat themescape with no breaking news, as can be seen in <ref type="figure">figure 7(a)</ref>. In contrast, among the top 30 topics discussed on CNN in the same period, the crisis related to the Korean nuclear tests stands out and is materialized in the peak visible on October 9. However, the CNN dataset is missing the first seven days of November (figure 7(b)) due to a hardware failure at that time. While a full comparative analysis may not be possible for this period, the channels can be used in a complementary way. Situations where an investigative reporter is faced with incomplete data are frequent. The case at hand seems to be a good simulation of such situations where complementary sources are used to build a full picture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2">Interactive Exploratory Analysis</head><p>On MSNBC, looking at the top 624 words over a period of 80 days, sorted and filtered to dispersion, the user can find several emerging stories while hovering on the bottom of the NewsRiver (as in the previous case study): Sept. 4-11, the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks; this story contains the words "9", "11", "Osama", "bin", "Laden", "Pakistan", and "Taliban". From Sept. 30 to Oct. 6, the page scandal of congressman Mark Foley; this story contains words such as "Foley", "Hastert", "speaker", "House", "page", and "scandal". From Oct. 3 to Oct. 20 roughly, the North Korean nuclear test, as it is being announced, carried out and condemned. On Oct. 11, a small plane crashes against a building in New York and revives the 9/11 story. On Oct. 27, Jim Webb won the democratic nomination for the 2006 Virginia Senate race. On Nov. 8, Donald Rumsfeld gave his resignation after the Democrats won the Senate.</p><p>Not all these stories related directly to the election, but all had an impact on the election (or in the case of Rumsfeld were caused by the election). The stories show impacts, in the days leading up to the election, on voter state-of-mind and statements or actions of candidates. They show a much more complete picture of relevant happenings than a mere query on "election" would provide.</p><p>The user needs to dig further down the words list to find more stories or make sense of existing ones. The top 788 frequent words on CNN reveal that the fatal injury of Steve Irwin (aka 'Crocodile Hunter') is aired on Sept. 4. In the top 1840 topics on CNN, on Sept. 15 and 16, CNN reports the controversy arising from Pope Benedict XVI's speech about Islam. On Oct. 2 and 3, the word "amish" emerges, casting a new light on a previously mentioned word "school". Put together these words refer to the deadly shooting occurring at an Amish school. On Nov. 8, topics such as Pelosi and Gates appear. On Nov. 15, General Abizaid is heard concerning Senator McCain's plan to increase U.S. troops in Iraq.</p><p>Using LensRiver (figure 8), the user can find other stories related to Donald Rumsfeld over the weeks preceding his resignation. One finds him in the 9/11 commemorations, then in a series of controversies, concerning the conduct of the Iraqi war, and the publication of a photo where he is seen shaking hands with Saddam in the 1980's.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">DISCUSSION</head><p>In the previous sections, we presented a NewsRiver visualization of dense streaming news topics, scaling up to several hundreds or thousands of topics at the same time. We showed that the exploratory NewsLab interface permits timely, effective access to the most relevant stories in the vast underlying video data base. Under the assumption that prominent news topics are likely to appear among the most frequent words, we rank all topics according to their overall word count. But with this ranking only, common words tend to clutter the top positions and obscure interesting topics. The latter, besides being frequent, are distributed over time in such a way that their count will surge upon the occurrence of prominent <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>: LensRiver, filtered on the dimension "Donald Rumsfeld" news stories. We therefore introduce an overall measure of dispersion, namely the coefficient of variation, that helps rank the most frequent topics according to their respective dispersion, thus separating common words (with low dispersion) from words related to prominent news stories (with higher dispersion). This approach also identifies common words (e.g., airport or school) which become prominent for a time, since their dispersion characteristics change. As described in the aforementioned case studies, this simple unstructured approach to streaming news data is successful at finding prominent stories in the news without prior knowledge of the news content, which makes it quite valuable as an exploratory tool. It also constitutes a useful initial ground for comparison between different broadcasters.</p><p>A word of caution is however necessary. Since the initial ranking of words is count-based, the longer the period of observation the slower significant topics will emerge from a count-based ranking as common words tend to find their way up in the ranking. Using an overall ranking may therefore be more suitable for relatively short periods. Having to do with longer periods, the user may need to dig far down in the topic list before secondary news stories will emerge. This pleads strongly in favor of using rolling/moving statistics (e.g. rolling average/standard deviation) instead of their all-encompassing counterparts.</p><p>The interactive filtering capabilities augment our approach in a very useful manner, since the user is allowed to filter out uninteresting content in various ways: statistically, lexically, and based on interestingness. Time and topic aggregation are also helpful at reducing otherwise intimidating volumes of information into a more manageable overview.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>With NewsLab, we have presented an interactive capability to explore many thousands of news stories over extended periods of time, comprising multiple terabytes of video data, and to discover emerging themes and relations. Investigators can get a quick overview of what is happening in the news at any given time, how stories evolve, merge, and subside, and how they are reported. Subtle comparisons, not possible without this mode of depiction, can be made.</p><p>Case study analyses provide evidence for how extended automated analyses can be developed and integrated into NewsLab. This will be the direction of future work. For example, it should be possible to do automated event analysis based on the emerging and waning themes described above. Automatic identification of relevant news stories related to these events could reveal the nature of the events. The strikingly different news reporting of different news outlets indicates that automated comparative analysis could be carried out between different news sources (national versus international, local versus national, etc.). Mechanisms to quickly compile different opinions on the same story could be developed.</p><p>In addition to this work, we plan to thoroughly integrate the visual interfaces of NewsLab, so that, in particular, interaction in one part will be directly linked to interaction in another part. We will also carry out evaluations both with specialists such as investigative reporters or media analysts and with more general users (to measure exploratory capabilities, for example).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>NewsLab: top 30 topics on CNN from 8/1 to 8/24/06</figDesc></figure>
