				<p>Fig. 1. A projection of topological similarities between 8,263 graphs measured by our RW-LOG-LAPLACIAN kernel. Based on the topological similarity, our approach shows what a graph would look like in different layouts and estimates their corresponding aesthetic metrics. We clustered the graphs based on their topological similarities for the purpose of the user study. The two graphs in each pair are the most topologically similar, but not isomorphic, to each other. The projection is computed with t-SNE [83], and the highlighted graphs are visualized with FM 3 layout [37]. An interactive plot is available in the supplementary materials [1].</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Graphs are popularly used to represent complex systems, such as social networks, power grids, and biological networks. Visualizing a graph can help us better understand the structure of the data. Many graph visualization methods have been introduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86]</ref>, with the most popular and intuitive method being the node-link diagram.</p><p>Over the last five decades, a multitude of methods have been devel-oped to lay out a node-link diagram. A graph's layout results can be greatly different depending on which layout method is used. Because the layout of a graph significantly influences the user's understanding of the graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>, it is important to find a "good" layout that can effectively depict the structure of the graph. Defining a good layout can be highly subjective and dependent on the given task. A suitable starting point for finding a good layout is to use both the aesthetic criteria, such as reducing edge crossings, and the user's visual inspection.</p><p>When the graph is large, computing several graph layouts and selecting one through visual inspection and/or aesthetic metrics is, unfortunately, not a practical solution. The amount of time it would take to compute these various layouts and aesthetic metrics is tremendous. For a graph with millions of vertices, a single layout can take hours or days to calculate. In addition, we often must consider multiple aesthetic metrics to evaluate a single graph layout, since there is no consensus on which criteria are the most effective or preferable <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. As graph data is commonly used in data analysis tasks and is expected to grow in size at even higher rates, alternative solutions are needed.</p><p>One possible solution is to quickly estimate aesthetic metrics and show what a graph would look like through predictive methods. In the field of machine learning, several methods have been used to predict the properties of graphs, such as the classes of graphs. One prominent approach to predicting such properties is to use a graph kernel. Graph kernel methods enable us to apply various kernelized machine learning techniques, such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, on graphs.</p><p>In this paper, we present a machine learning approach that can show what a graph would look like in different layouts and estimate their corresponding aesthetic metrics. The fundamental assumption of our approach is the following: given the same layout method, if the graphs have similar topological structures, then they will have similar resulting layouts. Under this assumption, we introduce new graph kernels to measure the topological similarities between graphs. Then, we apply machine learning techniques to show what a new input graph would look like in different layouts and estimate their corresponding aesthetic metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time graph kernels have been utilized in the field of graph visualization.</p><p>The primary contributions of this work include:</p><p>• A fast and accurate method to show what a graph would look like in different layouts. • A fast and accurate method to estimate graph layout aesthetic metrics. • A framework for designing graph kernels based on graphlets.</p><p>• A demonstration of the effectiveness of graph kernels as an approach to large graph visualization. We evaluate our methods in two ways. First, we compare 13 graph kernels, which include two state-of-the-art ones, based on accuracy and computation time for estimating aesthetic metrics. The results show that our estimations of aesthetic metrics are highly accurate and fast. Our graph kernels outperform existing kernels in both time and accuracy. Second, we conduct a user study to demonstrate that the topological similarity computed with our graph kernel matches the perceptual similarity assessed by human users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BACKGROUND</head><p>In this section, we present the notations and definitions used in this paper and introduce graph kernels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Notations and Definitions</head><p>Let G = (V, E) be a graph, where V = {v 1 ,...,v n } is a set of n vertices (or nodes), and E = e 1 ,...,e m | e = (</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v i , v j ), v i , v j ∈ V</formula><p>is a set of m edges (or links). An edge e = (v i , v j ) is said to be incident to vertex v i and vertex v j . An edge that connects a vertex to itself e = (v i , v i ) is called a self loop. Two or more edges that are incident to the same two vertices are called multiple edges. A graph is considered simple if it contains no self loops or multiple edges. An undirected graph is one where</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(v i , v j ) ∈ E ⇔ (v j , v i ) ∈ E.</formula><p>A graph is called unlabeled if there is no distinction between vertices other than their interconnectivity. In this paper, we consider simple, connected, undirected, and unlabeled graphs.</p><p>Given a graph G, a graph G = (V , E ) is a subgraph of G if V ⊆ V and E ⊆ E. A subgraph G = (V , E ) is called an induced <ref type="bibr">(or vertexinduced)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">subgraph of G if E = {(v i , v j ) | (v i , v j ) ∈ E and v i , v j ∈ V }, that is, all edges in E, between two vertices v i , v j ∈ V , are also present in E . Two graphs G = (V, E) and G = (V , E ) are isomorphic if there exists a bijection f : V → V , called isomorphism, such that (v i , v j ) ∈ E ⇔ ( f (v i ), f (v j )) ∈ E for all v i , v j ∈ V .</formula><p>Suppose we have empirical data (x 1 , y 1 ),...,(x n , y n ) ∈ X × Y, where the domain X is a nonempty set of inputs x i and Y is a set of corresponding targets y i . A kernel method predicts the target y of a new input x based on existing "similar" inputs and their outputs (x i , y i ). A function k : X × X → R that measures the similarity between two inputs is called a kernel function, or simply a kernel. A kernel function k is often defined as an inner product of two vectors in a feature space H:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">k(x, x ) = φ (x), φ (x ) = x, x</formula><p>where φ : X → H is called a feature map which maps an input x to a feature vector x in H.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Measuring Topological Similarities between Graphs</head><p>Based on our assumption, we need to measure the topological similarities between graphs. Depending on the discipline, this problem is called graph matching, graph comparison, or network alignment. In the last five decades, numerous approaches have been proposed to this problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. Each approach measures the similarity between graphs based on different aspects, such as isomorphism relation <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">92]</ref>, graph edit distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, or graph measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. However, many of these traditional approaches are either computationally expensive, not expressive enough to capture the topological features, or difficult to adapt to different problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. Graph kernels have been recently introduced for measuring pairwise similarities between graphs in the field of machine learning. They allow us to apply many different kernelized machine learning techniques, e.g. SVM <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, on graph problems, including graph classification problems found in bioinformatics and chemoinformatics.</p><p>A graph kernel can be considered to be an instance of an Rconvolution kernel <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. It measures the similarity between two graphs based on the recursively decomposed substructures of said graphs. The measure of similarity varies with each graph kernel based on different types of substructures in graphs. These substructures include walks <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85]</ref>, shortest paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, subtrees <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75]</ref>, cycles <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, and graphlets <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. Selecting a graph kernel is challenging as many kernels are available. To exacerbate the problem, there is no theoretical justification as to why one graph kernel works better than another for a given problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>.</p><p>Many graph kernels often have similar limitations as previously mentioned approaches. They do not scale well to large graphs (time complexity of O(|V | 3 ) or higher) or do not work well for unlabeled graphs. To overcome this problem, a graph kernel based on sampling a fixed number of graphlets has been introduced to be accurate and efficient on large graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref>.</p><p>Graphlets are small, induced, and non-isomorphic subgraph patterns in a graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 2</ref>). Graphlet frequencies ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>) have been used to characterize biological networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref>, identify disease genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, and analyze social network structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. Depending on the definition, the relative frequencies are called graphlet frequency distribution, graphlet degree distribution, or graphlet concentrations. While these works often have different definitions, the fundamental idea is to count the individual graphlets and compare their relative frequencies of occurrence between graphs. A graph kernel based on graphlet frequencies, called a graphlet kernel, was first proposed by Shervashidze et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. The main idea is to use a graphlet frequency vector as the feature vector of a graph, then compute the similarity between graphs by defining the inner product of the feature vectors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">APPROACH</head><p>Our approach is a supervised learning of the relationship between topological features of existing graphs and their various layout results. This also includes the layouts' aesthetic metrics. Like many supervised 0 2 4 6 g <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> 1 g 4 1 g 4 3 g 4 5 g 5 1 g 5 3 g 5 5 g 5 7 g 5 9 g 5 11 g <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref>  learning methods, our approach requires empirical data (training data) of existing graphs, their layout results, and corresponding aesthetic metrics. This generally takes a considerable amount of time, but can be considered a preprocessing step as it is only ever done once. The benefit of machine learning is that as we add more graphs and their layout results, the performance generally improves. In this section, we introduce: 1. A framework for designing better graphlet kernels 2. A process of using graph kernels to determine what a graph would look like in different layouts 3. A method to estimate the aesthetic metrics without calculating actual layouts</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Graphlet Kernel Design Framework</head><p>One of the key challenges of our approach is choosing a graph kernel. While many graph kernels are available, we focus on sampling based graphlet kernels because they are computationally efficient and are designed for unlabeled graphs. To improve the performance of a graphlet kernel, we introduce a framework for designing graphlet kernels. Our framework consists of three steps: 1. Sampling graphlet frequencies 2. Scaling graphlet frequency vectors 3. Defining an inner product between two graphlet frequency vectors For each step, we discuss several possible design choices. Our framework defines several new types of graphlet kernels.</p><p>Existing studies related to graphlets and graphlet kernels are scattered throughout the literature, including machine learning and network science. Each of the studies focuses on certain aspects of a graphlet kernel. Our framework unifies the related works for graphlet kernels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Sampling Graphlet Frequencies</head><p>One of the challenges for constructing a graphlet kernel is computing the graphlet frequencies. Exhaustive enumeration of graphlets with k vertices in a graph G is O(|V | k ), which is prohibitively expensive, even for graphs with a few hundred or more vertices. Thus, sampling approaches have been introduced to obtain the graphlet frequencies in a short amount of time with an acceptable error.</p><p>Random vertex sampling (RV): Most existing works on graphlet kernels have sampled graphlets using a random vertex sampling method <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. To sample a graphlet of size k, this method randomly chooses k vertices in V and induces the graphlet based on their adjacency in G. This step is repeated until the number of sampled graphlets is sufficient. Since this sampling method randomly chooses k vertices without considering their interconnectivity in G, it has several limitations. As many real-world networks are sparse <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, |E| O(|V | 2 ), most randomly sampled graphlets are disconnected. Consequently, the frequency of disconnected graphlets would be much higher than connected ones. If disconnected graphlets lack discriminating traits between graphs, and they outnumber the informative graphlets, comparing graphs becomes increasingly difficult. While we could only sample connected graphlets by excluding disconnected ones, this requires a tremendous number of sampling iterations to sample a sufficient number of connected graphlets. Since there is no lower bound on the number of iterations for sampling certain amounts of connected graphlets, using RV to sample only connected graphlets would lead to undesirable computation times.</p><p>Random walk sampling (RW): There are other methods to sample graphlets based on random walks, such as Metropolis-Hasting random walk <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>, subgraph random walk <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>, and expanded Markov chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, they have not been used for designing graphlet kernels in the machine learning community. Unlike RV sampling, they sample graphlets by traversing the structure of a given graph. That is, they search for the next sample vertices within the neighbors of the currently sampled vertices. Thus, they are able to sample connected graphlets very well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Scaling Graphlet Frequency Vector</head><p>A graphlet frequency vector x is defined such that each component x i corresponds to the relative frequency of a graphlet g i . In essence, the graphlet frequency vector of a graph is the feature vector of the graph.</p><p>Linear scale (LIN): Many existing graphlet kernels use linear scaling, often called graphlet concentration, which is the percentage of each graphlet in the graph. As several works use weighted counts w i of each graphlet g i , this scaling can be defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">x i = w i ∑ w i</formula><p>Logarithmic scale (LOG): Similar to the vertex degree distribution, the distribution of graphlet frequency often exhibits a power-law distribution. This again can cause a significant problem if graphlets that lack discriminating traits between graphs outnumber the informative graphlets. Thus, several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref> used a logarithmic scale of the graphlet frequency vector to solve this problem. While the exact definitions of these methods differ, we generalize it using the following definition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">x i = log w i + w b ∑(wi + w b )</formula><p>where w b &gt; 0 is a base weight to prevent log 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Defining Inner Product</head><p>Several kernel functions can be used to define the inner product in a feature space H.</p><p>Cosine similarity (COS): Most existing graphlet kernels use the dot product of two graphlet frequency vectors in Euclidean space, then normalize the kernel matrix. This is equivalent to the cosine similarity of two vectors, which is the L 2 -normalized dot product of two vectors:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">x, x = x • x T x x</formula><p>Gaussian radial basis function kernel (RBF): This kernel is popularly used in various kernelized machine learning techniques:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">x, x = exp − x − x 2 2σ 2</formula><p>where σ is a free parameter.</p><p>Laplacian kernel (LAPLACIAN): Laplacian kernel is a variant of RBF kernel:</p><p>x</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">, x = exp − x − x 1 σ where x − x 1</formula><p>is the L 1 distance, or Manhattan distance, of the two vectors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">What Would a Graph Look Like in This Layout? (WGL)</head><p>Graph kernels provide us with the topological similarities between graphs. Using these pairwise similarities, we design a nearest-neighbor based method, similar to k-nearest neighbors, to show what a graph would look like in different layouts. Given a new input graph G input , we find the k most topologically similar graphs and show their existing layout results to the users. Thus, if our assumption is true, users can expect the layout results of new input graphs by looking at the layout results of topologically similar graphs.</p><p>While graph kernels are able to find topologically similar graphs, many of them do not explicitly take the size of graphs into account. In rare cases, it is possible to find topologically similar graphs that vary in size. For instance, <ref type="figure">Fig. 3b</ref> and <ref type="figure">Fig. 3d</ref> have similar graphlet frequencies, yet have different layout results. To prevent this, we add some constraints when we find similar graphs, such as only counting a graph that has more than half and less than double the number of vertices in the input graph.</p><p>As a result, for the new input graph G input , we find k most similar graphs as follows:</p><p>1. Compute the similarity between existing graphs and G input 2. Remove the graphs that do not satisfy a set of constraints 3. Select the k most similar graphs After we have obtained the k most similar graphs to the input graph G input , we show their existing layout results to the user.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Estimating Aesthetic Metrics (EAM)</head><p>As the aesthetic metrics are continuous values, estimating the aesthetic metrics is a regression problem. There are several kernelized regression models, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>, that can be used for estimating the aesthetic metrics based on the similarities between graphs obtained by graph kernels. Computing actual aesthetic metrics of a layout requires a calculation of the layout first. However, our approach is able to estimate the metrics without calculating actual layouts.</p><p>Training: To estimate the aesthetic metrics, we first need to train a regression model by:</p><p>1. Prepare the training data (layouts and their aesthetic metrics of existing graphs) 2. Compute a kernel matrix using a graph kernel (pairwise similarities between all graphs in the training data) 3. Train regression model Estimation: To make an estimation of a new input graph, the following steps are required:</p><p>1. Compute similarity between the input graph and other graphs in the training data 2. Estimate value using the trained regression model</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">EVALUATION 1: ESTIMATING LAYOUT AESTHETIC METRICS</head><p>There are several questions we wanted to answer within this evaluation:</p><p>• Is our method able to accurately estimate the layout's aesthetic metrics without computing the layout? • Is our method able to quickly obtain the estimations?</p><p>• Does our graph kernels, derived from our framework, outperform state-of-the-art graph kernels in terms of computation time and estimation accuracy? We describe the experimental design, apparatus, implementation, and metrics used in the study. We also answer each of these questions in the results section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experimental Design</head><p>We perform 10-fold cross-validations to compare 13 different graph kernels in terms of their accuracy and computation times for estimating four aesthetic metrics on eight layout methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Datasets</head><p>We started by collecting around 3,700 graphs from <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, which includes, but not limited to, social networks, web document networks, and geometric meshes. Without loss of generality, graphs with multiple connected components were broken down into separate graphs (one connected component to one graph). After that, we removed any graph with less than 100 vertices, as there would be little benefit from a machine learning approach since most layout methods are fast enough for small graphs. This left us with a total of 8,263 graphs for our study. The graphs range from 100 vertices, and 100 edges up to 113 million vertices and 1.8 billion edges. More details about the graphs, such as characteristic measures and layout results, can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Not all graphs were used for each layout method, as some layout algorithms failed to compute the results within a reasonable amount of time (10 days) or ran out of memory. Exact numbers of graphs used for each layout are reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Kernels</head><p>We compare a total of 13 graphlet kernels. Using our framework, 12 graphlet kernels are derived from a combination of 2 graphlet sampling methods (RV and RW) × 2 types of graphlet frequency vector scaling (LIN and LOG) × 3 inner products (COS, RBF, and LAPLACIAN). We denote a kernel derived from our framework by a combination of the above abbreviations. For example, RW-LOG-LAPLACIAN denotes a graphlet kernel which samples graphlets based on a random walk, uses a log scaled graphlet frequency vector, and computes the similarity using the Laplacian kernel function. We also compare with state-of-the-art graphlet kernels. The original graphlet kernel <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> can be constructed using our framework and is included in the 12 kernels (RV-LIN-COS). Lastly, the 13 th graph kernel is a Deep Graphlet Kernel (DGK) <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>.</p><p>We used a sampling method from Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> as the RW sampling. For all kernels, we sampled 10,000 graphlets of 3, 4, and 5 vertices for each graph. The graphlets of 3, 4, and 5 vertices are widely used due to computational costs. Also, the graphlets of 6 or more vertices are rare <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. RW sampling considers only connected graphlets, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, while RV sampling counts both connected and disconnected graphlets, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91]</ref>. All kernel matrices are normalized such that the similarity between a graph and itself has a value of 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Layouts</head><p>The process of laying out a graph has been actively studied for over five decades. Several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86]</ref> provide a comprehensive review of these layout methods. While there are methods designed for specific purposes, such as orthogonal layout methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, in this work, we focus on two-dimensional layout methods that draw all edges in straight lines. Due to the volume of layout methods proposed, evaluating all the methods is impractical. For this evaluation, we used eight representative layout methods of five families based on groupings found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86]</ref>. Our selection process prioritized methods that have been popularly used, have a publicly available implementation, and have a proven track record over other state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>Force-directed methods: Force-directed methods are based on a physical model of attraction and repulsion. They are among the first layout methods to be developed and are some of the most commonly used layout methods today. In general, force-directed layout methods fall within two groups: spring-electrical <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref> and energy-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. We selected one from each group: Fruchterman-Reingold (FR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> from spring-electrical approaches and Kamada-Kawai (KK) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> from energy-based approaches.</p><p>Dimension reduction based method: Dimension reduction techniques, including multidimensional scaling (MDS) or principal component analysis (PCA), can be used to lay out a graph using the graph-theoretic distance between node pairs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.4">Aesthetic Metrics</head><p>Aesthetic criteria, e.g., minimizing the number of edge crossings, are used for improving the readability of a graph layout. Bennett et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> reviewed various aesthetic criteria from a perceptual basis. Aesthetic metrics enable a quantitative comparison of the aesthetic quality of different layouts. While there are many aesthetic criteria and metrics available, many of them are informally defined or are defined only for specific types of layout methods. Many also do not have a normalized metric for comparing graphs of different sizes, or are too expensive to compute (e.g., symmetry metric in <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> is O(n 7 )). In this evaluation, we chose four aesthetic metrics because they have a normalized form, are not defined only for specific types of layouts, and can be computed in a reasonable amount of time.</p><p>Crosslessness (m c ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>: Minimizing the number of edge crossings has been found as one of the most important aesthetic criteria in many studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70]</ref>. The crosslessness m c is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">m c = 1 − c c max , if c max &gt; 0 1, otherwise</formula><p>where c is the number of edge crossings and c max is the approximated upper bound of the number of edge crossings, which is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">c max = |E| (|E| − 1) 2 − 1 2 ∑ v∈V (deg(v)(deg(v) − 1))</formula><p>Minimum angle metric (m a ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>: This metric quantifies the criteria of maximizing the minimum angle between incident edges on a vertex. It is defined as the average absolute deviation of minimum angles between the incident edges on a vertex and the ideal minimum angle θ (v) of the vertex:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">m a = 1 − 1 |V | ∑ v∈V θ (v) − θ min (v) θ (v) , θ (v) = 360 • deg(v)</formula><p>where θ min (v i ) is the minimum angle between the incident edges on the vertex. Edge length variation (m l ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>: Uniform edge lengths have been found to be effective aesthetic criteria for measuring the quality of a layout in several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. The coefficient of variance of the edge length (l cv ) has been used to quantify this criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Since the upper bound of the coefficient of variation of n values is √ n − 1 [51], we divide l cv by |E| − 1 to normalize:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">m l = l cv |E| − 1 , l cv = l σ l µ = ∑ e∈E (l e − l µ ) 2 |E| • l 2 µ</formula><p>where l σ is the standard deviation of the edge length and l µ is the mean of the edge length. Shape-based metric (m s ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>: Shape-based metric is a more recent aesthetic metric and was proposed for evaluating the layouts of large graphs. The shape-based metric m s is defined by the mean Jaccard similarity (MJS) between the input graph G input and the shape graph G S :</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">m s = MJS(G input , G S ), MJS(G 1 , G 2 ) = 1 |V | ∑ v∈V |N 1 (v) ∩ N 2 (v)| |N 1 (v) ∪ N 2 (v)|</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">G 1 = (V, E 1 ) and G 2 = (V, E 2 )</formula><p>are two graphs with the same vertex set and N i (u) is the set of neighbours of v in G i .

The kernels using LAPLACIAN as the inner product show higher accuracy (mean RMSE = .0956 and mean R 2 = .5367) than ones using RBF (mean RMSE = .1047 and mean R 2 = .4393) and COS (mean RMSE = .1169 and mean R 2 = .3362).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.2">Computation Time</head><p>Since some algorithms are implemented in parallel while others are not, we report CPU times. The estimation time is comprised of the computation steps required for estimation in Sect. 3.3. Our RW-LOG-LAPLACIAN kernel, which shows the best estimation accuracy, also shows the fastest computation time for estimation. On average, it takes .14093 seconds (SD = 1.9559) per graph to make the estimations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref> shows the computation time for layouts and their aesthetic metrics.</p><p>Most of the time spent on estimation was devoted to sampling graphlets. The RW sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> shows fastest computation time, with an average of .14089 seconds (SD = 1.9559) per graph. The graphlet sampling for DGK take longer than RW, with an average of 3.38 seconds (SD = 7.88) per graph. The RV sampling take the longest time, with an average of 6.81 seconds (SD = 7.04).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Discussion</head><p>Our graph kernels perform exceptionally well in both estimation accuracy and computation time. Specifically, RW-LOG-LAPLACIAN outperforms all other kernels in all metrics except crosslessness (m c ) on the FM <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . RW-LOG-RBF is the best performing kernel on FM <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> 's crosslessness (m c ) and is the second best kernel. Existing graph kernels are ranked in the bottom three of all kernel methods we tested.</p><p>A possible explanation for this is that certain types of graphlets are essential for accurate estimation. The kernels using RW sampling, which samples connected graphlets very efficiently, show a higher accuracy than other kernels. While disconnected graphlets are shown to be essential for classification problems in bioinformatics <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, for our problem, we suspect that connected graphlets are more important for accurate estimation.</p><p>Other sampling methods are not suitable for sampling connected graphlets. There are 49 possible graphlets, where the size of each graphlet is k ∈ {3, 4, 5}, and 29 of them are connected graphlets <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 2)</ref>. However, when we sample 10,000 graphlets per graph using RV sampling, on average only 1.913% (SD = 6.271) of sampled graphlets are connected graphlets. Furthermore, 35.77% of graphs have no connected graphlets in the samples even though all graphs are connected, making it impossible to effectively compare graphs.</p><p>The kernels using LOG scaling show more accurate estimations than the ones using LIN. We suspect this is because of the distribution of graphlets, which often exhibit a power-law distribution. Thus, when using LOG scaling, a regression model is less affected by the graphlets with overwhelming frequencies and becomes better at discriminating graphs with different structures.</p><p>Our estimation times are fast and scale well, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref>. At around 200 vertices, our estimation times become faster than all other layout computation times. Our estimation times also outperform the computations of the four aesthetic metrics past 1,000 vertices. As the size of a graph increases, the differences become larger, to the point that our RW-LOG-LAPLACIAN takes several orders of magnitude less time than both layout computation and metric computation. Normally the layout has to be calculated in order to calculate aesthetic metrics. This is not the case for our estimation as the aesthetic metrics can be estimated without the layout result, leading to a considerable speed up.</p><p>It is interesting to see that each sampling method shows different computation times, even though we sampled the same amount of graphlets. A possible explanation for this discrepancy can be attributed to locality of reference. We stored the graphs using an adjacency list data structure in memory. Thus, RW sampling, which finds the next sample vertices within the neighbors of currently sampled vertices, tends to exhibit good locality. On the other hand, RV sampling chooses vertices randomly, thus it would show poor locality which leads to cache misses and worse performance. The sampling method of DGK is a variant of RV. After one graphlet is randomly sampled, its immediate neighbors are also sampled. This would have better locality than RV and could explain the better computation time.</p><p>In terms of training, except for DGK, all other kernels spend negligible times computing the kernel matrix, with an average of 5.99 seconds (SD = 3.26). However, computing the kernel matrix of DGK takes a considerable amount of time because it requires computation of language modeling (implemented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>). On average it take 182.96 seconds (SD = 9.31).</p><p>Since there are many parameters of each layout method, and most parameters are not discrete, it is impossible to test all combinations of parameter settings. To simplify the study, we only used default parameters for each layout method. It is possible to apply our approach to different predefined parameter settings on the same layout method. However, generating new training data for multiple settings can be time consuming.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">EVALUATION 2: WHAT WOULD A GRAPH LOOK LIKE IN THIS LAYOUT?</head><p>In this section, we describe our user study that evaluates how well our WGL method (Sect. 3.2) is able to find graphs that users assess as being perceptually similar to the actual layout results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Experimental Design</head><p>We designed a ranking experiment to compare topological similarity ranks (r T ) obtained by our WGL method and perceptual similarity ranks (r P ) assessed by humans. That is, if both our WGL method and participants' choices match, then we can conclude our WGL method is able to find perceptually similar graphs to the actual layout results.  <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. A task from the user study. For each task, the participants were given one target graph and nine choice graphs. They were then asked to rank the three most similar graphs in order of decreasing similarity. The three images on the right show the central nodes of (a), (b), and (c).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Task</head><p>For each task, participants were given one target graph and nine choice graphs. An example of a task given to participants is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. They were asked to rank the three most similar graphs to the target graph in order of decreasing similarity. The instructions were given as such, "select the most similar graph." for the first choice and "select the next most similar graph." for the second and third choice. To avoid biases, we did not specify what is "similar" and let the participants decide for themselves. In each task, the same layout method was used for target and choice graphs. We did not notify this to the participants. To test our approach using graphs with different topological structures and different layout methods, we used 72 tasks comprised of nine graphs and eight layout methods.</p><p>While other task designs are possible, such as participants ranking all nine graphs or individually rating all nine choices, during our pilot study we found that these task designs are overwhelming to the participants. The participants found it very difficult to rank between dissimilar graphs. For example, in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>, selecting the fourth or fifth most similar graph is challenging as there is little similarity to the target graph after the first three choices. Also, the focus of our evaluation is to determine how well our WGL method is able to find similar graphs, not dissimilar graphs. Thus, we only need to see which graphs our participants perceive as similar in the task, which simultaneously reduces task load when compared to ranking all nine graphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Graphs</head><p>To gather an unbiased evaluation, the target graphs and their choice graphs must be carefully selected.</p><p>Selecting target graphs. To test our approach on graphs with different topological structures, we select nine target graphs as follows:</p><p>We clustered the 8,263 graphs into nine groups using spectral clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. For each cluster, we select ten representative graphs which have the highest sum of topological similarity within the cluster (i.e., the ten nearest graphs to the center of each cluster). Then, we randomly select one graph from these ten representative graphs to be the target graph. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> shows the selected nine target graphs in FM 3 layout <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Selecting choice graphs. To test our approach on graphs with different topological similarities obtained by graph kernels, we select nine choice graphs for each target graph as follows: We compute nine clusters of graphs based on the topological similarity between a graph and the target graph using Jenks natural breaks <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, which can be seen as one dimensional k-means clustering. We designate one of the nine choice graphs to represent what our approach would predict. This is done by selecting the graph with the highest similarity to the target graph from the cluster nearest to the target graph. For the other eight clusters, we randomly select one choice graph from a set of ten graphs that have the highest sum of similarity within the cluster (i.e., the ten nearest graphs to the center of each cluster). These can be considered as  representative graphs of each cluster. A list of the selected nine choice graphs for each target graph can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. When we select a choice graph, we filter out graphs that have less than half or more than double the amount of vertices as the target graph. This can be considered as a constraint in our WGL method Sect. 3.2.</p><p>To evaluate under the condition that isomorphic graphs to the target graph are not present in the training data, we also filter out graphs that have the same number of vertices and edges as the target graph.</p><p>The clustering approach based on topological similarity can be used for defining a topological classification of graphs. However, it would require further analysis of resultant clusters.</p></div>

Thus, we believe our WGL method is able to provide the expected layout results that are perceptually similar to the actual layout results.</p><p>When we analyze participants' responses for the predicted choices (r T = 1) for each layout separately, we find that the predicted choices with Spectral and Treemap layouts are ranked lower than with other layouts. The common reasons given by participants for selecting choice graphs with Spectral layout were "line shape" and "number of vertices". We notice that the Spectral layouts have many nodes that overlap each other. Treemap, on the other hand, produces similar looking graphs due to its geometric constraints. This observation was mirrored by many participants who said "they all look similar" for the choices with Treemap layout. Common reasons for selecting choice graphs with Treemap layout were "edge density" and "overall edge direction".</p><p>It is interesting to see how people perceive certain structures as more important than others. For instance, when we look at the responses on target graphs separately, we notice that target graph G 2331 has different response patterns. Target graph G 2331 and its choice graph are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. Participants' responses for r P = 1 are split between two choices, <ref type="figure">Fig. 5b and Fig. 5c</ref>. The common reasons why the participants ranked <ref type="figure">Fig. 5c</ref> as the most similar to <ref type="figure">Fig. 5a</ref> were "density", "shape", and "number of edges". On the other hand, the common reason why the participants ranked <ref type="figure">Fig. 5b</ref> as the most similar to <ref type="figure">Fig. 5a</ref> was "the number of central nodes". Our method also chose <ref type="figure">Fig. 5c</ref> as the most similar graph because of the general structure matching the target graph, but ranked <ref type="figure">Fig. 5b</ref> as being second most similar r T = 2. In the case of target graph G 2331 , the number of nodes in the center held more value to some participants than the overall structure.</p><p>In our user study, only one similar graph was chosen and shown by our system per target graph. In a real system, the user would be given several similarly looking graphs, including isomorphic graphs. Thus, the real system would show more layouts closer to the actual one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">RELATED WORK</head><p>Only a handful of studies have used topological features for visualizing graphs. Perhaps this is why there is a scarcity of studies applying machine learning techniques to the process of visualizing a graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Niggemann and Stein <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> introduced a learning method to find an optimal layout method for a clustered graph. The method constructs a handcrafted feature vector of a cluster from a number of graph measures, including the number of vertices, diameter, and maximum vertex degree. Then, it attempts to find an optimal layout for each cluster. However, these features have been proved as not expressive enough to capture topological similarities in many graph kernel works <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>.</p><p>Behrisch et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> proposed a technique called Magnostics, where a graph is represented as a matrix view and image-based features are used to find similar matrices. One of the challenges of a matrix view is the vertex ordering. Depending on the ordering, even the same graph can be measured as a different graph from itself. Graph kernels do not suffer from the same problem since they measure the similarity using only the topology of the graph.</p><p>Several techniques have used machine learning approaches to improve the quality of a graph layout <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Some of these techniques used evolutionary algorithms for learning user preferences with a human-inthe-loop assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80]</ref>, while others have designed neural network algorithms to optimize a layout for certain aesthetic criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89]</ref>. One major limitation of these techniques is that models learned from one graph are not usable in other graphs. Since these techniques often require multiple computations of layouts and their aesthetic metrics, the learning process can be highly time-consuming. These techniques can benefit from our approach by quickly showing the expected layout results and estimating the aesthetic metrics.</p><p>Many empirical studies have been conducted to understand the relation between topological characteristics of graphs and layout methods. The main idea is to find the "best" way to lay out given graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. To achieve this, Archambault et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> introduced a layout method which first recursively detects the topological features of subgraphs, such as whether a subgraph is a tree, cluster, or complete graph. Then, each subgraph is laid out using the suitable method according to its topological characteristics. A drawback of this method is that the feature detectors are limited to five classes. Our kernel can be utilized for heterogeneous feature detection with less computational cost.</p><p>A number of recent studies investigated sampling methods for large graph visualization. Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref> evaluated a number of graph sampling methods in terms of resulting visualization. They found that different visual features were preserved when different sampling strategies were used. Nguyen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> proposed a new family of quality metrics for large graphs based on a sampled graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>We have developed a machine learning approach using graph kernels for the purpose of showing what a graph would look like in different layouts and their corresponding aesthetic metrics. We have also introduced a framework for designing graphlet kernels, which allows us to derive several new ones. The estimations using our new kernels can be derived several orders of magnitude faster than computing the actual layouts and their aesthetic metrics. Also, our kernels outperform state-of-the-art kernels in both accuracy and computation time. The results of our user study show that the topological similarity computed with our kernel matches perceptual similarity assessed by human users.</p><p>In our work, we have only considered a subset of layout methods. A possible future direction is to include more layout methods with additional parameter settings for each method. Mechanical Turk could be used to conduct such an experiment at scale. Another possible future direction of this work is to introduce a new layout method which quickly predicts the actual layout instead of just showing the expected results of the input graph. We hope this paper opens a new area of study into using machine learning approaches for large graph visualization.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>All connected graphlets of 3, 4, or 5 vertices.</figDesc></figure>
