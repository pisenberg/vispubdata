While the streamlines are seeded on one part of the boundary, the remaining part serves as escape border. Hence, the seeding part of the boundary represents a map of streamline behavior, indicating if streamlines reach the escape border or not. Since the resulting maps typically exhibit a very fine and complex structure and are thus not amenable to direct sampling, our approach instead aims at topologically consistent extraction of their boundary. We show that isocline surfaces of the projected vector field provide a robust basis for streamsurface-based extraction of these boundaries.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Vector fields are a concept at the core of science and engineering. Since they typically represent transport or a directional property in general, their analysis usually needs to take into account their global structure, which is reflected by integral curves such as streamlines. While there is a large body of literature on the visualization based on integral curves, there is a subfield, denoted vector field topology, which aims at the extraction of the global structure of streamlines. In analogy to geometric topology, one analyzes the connectivity of the domain by means of streamlines, i.e., regions that exhibit coherent streamline shape represent connected regions and are visualized as such. To do so, the boundaries between these regions are of particular interest-they represent so-called separatrices that separate the qualitatively different regions, and in unbounded domains, they represent manifolds of streamlines that converge in forward or reverse direction to critical points, which are isolated zeros of the vector field, or to periodic orbits, which are isolated closed streamlines. Hence, to decide if a quantity can be transported by a vector field between two points, it is sufficient to test if these two points reside in the same region of coherent behavior. An impeding difficulty with this approach, however, arises if the domain is bounded or if the transport in subregions is of interest. In such cases, concepts from traditional vector field topology cannot provide the answer in generic configurations because the required critical points, periodic orbits, and separatrices can be located (partially) outside the domain and are hence not available.</p><p>Our approach is intrinsically independent of constructs such as critical points or periodic orbits. It can determine streamline-based connectivity between the boundary of arbitrary simply-connected regions Ω of the domain, and hence extends traditional vector field topology. To this end, one simply-connected part of the boundary of Ω is defined as map boundary where streamlines are conceptually seeded, and the remaining part of the boundary is the escape boundary. Our technique then provides a map, which we call escape map, on the map boundary, indicating if a streamline seeded at the respective position reaches the escape boundary or not. Thus, escape maps do not map to the position of escape but they provide a map if a respective streamline escapes. We refer to those parts of the map that escape as escape regions and to those that do not escape as rest regions. The boundaries between escape regions and rest regions are denoted escape region boundaries. Applications of escape maps include cases where one is interested if a substance can leave a region under the transport of a flow, for example, in the context of pollution or supply.</p><p>A straightforward implementation to obtain the streamline-based mapping between the map boundary and the escape boundary would  It is impossible to judge whether there is a corridor between (ii) and (iv).

This approach has been already used in the astrophysics community to analyze coronal holes, which represent regions of the Sun's photosphere with reduced ultraviolet or X-ray emission, and are defined in this context as those regions on the photosphere that exhibit streamlines of the solar magnetic field that reach, in forward or reverse direction, an escape radius which is larger than the radius of the photosphere. In this configuration, the photosphere represents the map boundary, and the escape radius defines the escape boundary. The extraction of coronal holes is one of the applications that we demonstrate our approach with, among examples from computational fluid dynamics and magma convection in the Earth's mantle. The major difficulty with this direct sampling approach ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1(a)</ref>) is, however, that it is typically not able to reveal the correct structure of the escape map because this map typically exhibits extremely thin features which cannot be appropriately sampled with a regular sampling ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figs. 1 and 2</ref>). At the same time, these fine structures typically exhibit diverging streamlines, which leads to strong error accumulation during integration from the map boundary and hence inaccurate or even useless streamlines and resulting mappings.</p><p>In this work, we show, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, the close connection between the topological concept of escape maps and isocline surfaces of the vector field, and derive from this connection a sampling technique for escape maps that guarantees their topologically correct extraction. Since our approach extracts only escape region boundaries, i.e., the boundary curves between escape regions and rest regions of the escape map ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1(c)</ref>), we complement our technique with a view-dependent implementation of the straightforward sampling approach, demonstrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1(a)</ref>.</p><p>Specifically, our contributions include:</p><p>• The introduction of escape maps to scientific visualization,</p><p>• a topologically correct and robust extraction technique for the escape region boundaries within escape maps,</p><p>• derivation of the connection between isocline surfaces and concepts from vector field topology, and</p><p>• a view-dependent implementation for direct sampling-based visualization of escape maps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Since both the concept and our extraction technique for escape maps are closely related to vector field topology, we start with an overview on related work in this field. Vector field topology was introduced to scientific visualization by the works due to Perry and Chong <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, Helman and Hesselink <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, and Globus et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.

One example are periodic orbits, which Wischgoll et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and Kasten et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> present extraction techniques for. We refer the reader to Asimov's notes on topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> for an introduction. More recently, vector field topology has been extended to uncertain <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> and time-dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> vector fields. Other conceptual contributions to this field include saddle connectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and connectrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Scheuermann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> include the domain boundary in topological analysis to avoid missed topological structures in 2D vector fields. Other related work includes traditional topological visualization in constrained flow fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. However, to determine regions of qualitatively similar behavior, all these techniques, in contrast to ours, require that the respective constructs, i.e., critical points or periodic orbits, reside within the domain. There are two previous works that are closely related to our technique. The boundary switch connectors due to Weinkauf et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> introduce boundary switch curves, i.e., curves on the boundary of Ω at which the 3D vector field switches from inside to outside flow behavior, and separation surfaces consisting of streamsurfaces seeded at these curves. This technique is also independent of critical points and periodic orbits, and provides a topological analysis on bounded domains. However, as we will show below, it is in general not possible to obtain escape maps with this approach, also because boundary switch curves are constrained to the boundary of Ω. Nevertheless, there are cases where part of the escape region boundaries in our escape maps can be obtained using boundary switch curves. The second technique that is closely related are bifurcation lines and their manifolds <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Bifurcation lines can be seen as a generalization ('elongation') of saddletype critical points, i.e., they represent streamlines that locally over the longest time exhibit a 2D manifold of streamlines converging to them in forward time and a 2D manifold of streamlines converging to them in reverse time. Bifurcation lines also address topological analysis in bounded domains, they are able to extract 2D manifolds of saddle-type critical points that reside outside Ω or saddle periodic orbits, including their 2D manifolds, even if part of the orbit is located outside Ω. It has to be noted that both techniques ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>) are somewhat complementary, i.e., boundary switch curves in general cannot extract the manifolds that bifurcation lines do and vice versa. Nevertheless, as we will also show below, bifurcation lines (and their manifolds) in general cannot extract escape maps either.</p><p>In the related application domain of solar magnetic fields, escape map extraction corresponds to the determination of coronal holes. Due to the lack of sensing techniques that would be able to provide 3D data of the Sun's magnetic field, there are different approaches that extrapolate such data from line of sight magnetograms. The most realistic approach makes use of a full 3D global magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model (Mackay and Yeates <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">EXTRACTION OF ESCAPE REGION BOUNDARIES</head><p>Let us start with an introduction of the different terms and symbols. The map boundary and escape boundary are denoted ∂ Ω M and ∂ Ω E , respectively. Both have to be simply connected and together they enclose a simply-connected region Ω. If a streamline seeded on ∂ Ω M reaches ∂ Ω E in forward or in reverse direction, we refer to it as escape streamline, otherwise as rest streamline.</p><p>As a prerequisite for the formulation that will follow, we first need to provide Ω with a regular parametrization x(ξ , η, ζ ). (Here and in the following, we use boldface symbols to indicate vector-valued functions.) In this parametrization, the map boundary ∂ Ω M is represented by the set {x(ξ , η, 0)} and the escape boundary ∂ Ω E is composed of the subsets ∂ Ω t = {x(ξ , η, 1)} and ∂ Ω s = {x(±1, ±1, ζ )} if Ω is not periodic in ξ and η. Thus, x(ξ , η, ζ ) maps the computational space coordinates ξ , η, ζ to the physical space Cartesian coordinates x, y, z, see <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>.</p><p>Given Ω is a rectangular domain, determining a regular parametrization x(ξ , η, ζ ) is straightforward. If Ω has generic simplyconnected shape, however, the problem is equivalent to meshing Ω with a structured grid. Following Thompson <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, this could be accomplished by solving a boundary-value problem of the Laplacian equation, for example.</p><p>Our technique extracts escape region boundaries, i.e., the curves on ∂ Ω M that separate escape regions from rest regions. In the first step of our technique, the escape region boundary curves are extracted based on isocline surfaces of the vector field (Sec. 3.2). This step typically extracts the majority of the boundary curves. The remaining curves are extracted based on vector field topology features within Ω (Sec. 3.3). Algorithmic (discretization) details are given in Sec. 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Motivation</head><p>The straightforward approach to visualize escape maps is by direct sampling. This approach consists of seeding a set of streamlines on ∂ Ω M and color their starting point with one of three different colors: (i) (in our examples blue) indicating that the streamline reaches ∂ Ω E in forward direction, (ii) (yellow) indicating that the streamline reaches ∂ Ω E in reverse direction, and (iii) (gray) indicating that the streamline does not reach ∂ Ω E . Note that if the streamline reaches ∂ Ω E in both directions, it represents an inbound boundary switch curve <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. However, since such curves do not separate escape regions from rest regions (in fact they separate forward escape regions from reverse escape regions), they are of no particular interest. Nevertheless, our extraction technique obtains them. The straightforward sampling approach is traditionally applied in a static manner, i.e., a texture is built with these colors and mapped to the physical space. Unfortunately, this approach cannot extract very narrow escape regions (corridors), as illustrated by Figs. 1(a) and 2. Note that, in favor of the direct sampling approach, we compare our technique to a view-dependent implementation of the direct sampling, i.e., the figures in this paper show a 'texture' that is computed interactively at screen resolution. This allows the user to zoom at the desired features interactively. There are two major reasons why the straightforward approach still fails at resolving the corridors: the corridors are extremely narrow and hence extremely high zoom factors would be required, which would lead to numerical issues with sampling, and secondly, streamline integration is subject to numerical issues too ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2)</ref>, even with double-precision arithmetic. This is of particular impact in these configurations as the growth of integration error is much higher in the direction from corridors on ∂ Ω M compared to integration toward corridors on ∂ Ω M , because streamlines have to diverge in direction away from ∂ Ω M to cause a narrow escape region, and this diverging streamline behavior represents unpredictable advection and hence typically impedes proper integration. Therefore, it is very difficult to discretize the fine structures on ∂ Ω M in a pixel-based manner. In contrast, it turns out to be much simpler to generate seeding constructs at some distance from ∂ Ω M and to obtain therefrom a polyline representation of the escape region boundaries, because streamlines converge toward the corridors in this direction of integration and thus are typically highly accurate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Isocline Surface-Based Extraction Step</head><p>Escape maps are defined by the topological connectivity between ∂ Ω M and ∂ Ω E . Since topological properties are invariant under continuous deformation, the connectivity between ∂ Ω M and ∂ Ω E is equivalent in both physical and computational space. Hence, our extraction technique can operate in computational space. Unless stated explicitly, we refer to the velocity field in computational space as 'vector field' throughout this paper. In the following, we discuss the utility of isocline surfaces (Sec. 3.2.1), subsequently, we present the extraction technique (Sec. 3.2.2), followed by its discussion (Sec. 3.2.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Motivation</head><p>Isocline surfaces consist of the loci where a vector field exhibits a predefined slope. Zero-slope isocline surfaces can be obtained by computing the dot product between the vector field and the 'up' vector (in our case (0, 0, 1) ⊤ in computational space) and extracting the zerolevel isosurface from the resulting scalar field, denoted isocline surface or isocline henceforth. See the dashed/green curves in <ref type="figure">Figs. 3 and 4</ref> for illustrations of zero-slope isoclines.</p><p>Since our rest streamlines, i.e., those that do not escape, are continuously differentiable and bounded by ∂ Ω, they must (i) converge to a critical point, (ii) find some kind of infinite path inside Ω, e.g., toward a periodic orbit, or (iii) rise from ∂ Ω M and return to ∂ Ω M again. Since critical points are zeros of the vector field, they must reside on isocline surfaces. The case (ii) of an infinite path in a bounded region implies a return of the streamline, and, thus, in the non-degenerate case, a zero slope in at least two and at most an even number of points along the curve. The case (iii) must, due to the mean value theorem, exhibit an odd number of zero-slope points along the streamline. Hence, all cases exhibit at least one intersection with the isocline surface. Therefore, any rest streamline seeded on ∂ Ω M will intersect the isocline surface at least once. If we reject all parts of isocline surfaces that are intersected by an escape streamline, we obtain a trimmed isocline surface Θ, and its boundary curves ∂ Θ are necessary and sufficient seeding structures to obtain all rest streamlines that connect to an escape region boundary. Once we propagate ∂ Θ along the vector field both in forward and reverse direction, their intersection with ∂ Ω M will be at an escape region boundary. Note that boundary curves ∂ Θ that are directly located on ∂ Ω M are either between escape and rest regions or between forward and backward escape regions (and in both cases inbound boundary switch curves).</p></div>

Extract all isocline surfaces with slope zero relative to ∂ Ω M , i.e., extract the zero-level isosurface of the 'up' component of the vector field within Ω.

For each remaining surface part, extract its boundary curve. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref>. Use these boundary curves as seeds for streamsurfaces.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Discussion</head><p>The approach described in Sec. 3.2.2 cannot produce false positives in a continuous formulation. The cases depicted in Figs. 4(a)-(c) are simplified (degenerate)-in general, a critical point, periodic orbit, or bifurcation line would never be located exactly at the 'highest' point of an isocline surface with its 2D manifold aligned with the isocline. Thus, in general, at least a small part of the isocline surface is located above the 2D manifold and hence eroded, leaving a 'hole'. Integrating a streamsurface from the boundary of this hole in forward direction converges to the critical point, periodic orbit, or bifurcation line, since in the continuous case, this boundary coincides with the 2D manifold. However, in a discretized formulation (our implementation), the isocline surface is eroded a bit too much due to discretization and hence the stream surface is likely to miss the critical point, periodic orbit, or bifurcation line. It will rather deviate to the bottom and intersect ∂ Ω M at the red point in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4(b)</ref>, leading to a false positive. The reverse streamsurface, on the other hand, will successfully extract the blue points in <ref type="figure">Figs. 4(a)</ref>-(c). Therefore, in our implementation, we avoid false positives by integrating streamsurfaces seeded at isocline boundaries only in direction opposite to the streamlines that caused the erosion of that isocline boundary (no streamsurface is seeded in case of forward and reverse escape). To assure robust extraction of the escape region boundaries, we nevertheless apply the topology-based approach (Sec. 3.3) also in our discretized implementation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Topology-Based Extraction Step</head><p>Because escape regions give rise to streamlines that reach ∂ Ω E , in contrast to those seeded at rest regions, these two regions exhibit qualitatively different streamline behavior. Hence, extraction by concepts from vector field topology is an obvious choice. One such concept are separatrices, i.e., manifolds of streamlines converging in forward or reverse direction to saddle-type critical points or saddle-type periodic orbits. They represent barriers with respect to qualitatively different streamline behavior and should therefore be able to provide the boundaries of escape regions. Note that a saddle-type critical point, i.e., an isolated zero of the vector field with opposite signs of the real eigenvalue parts of the Jacobian, exhibits one 2D manifold and one 1D manifold, while a saddle-type periodic orbit, i.e., an isolated closed streamline with saddle-type behavior in its mapping under a full revolution, exhibits two 2D manifolds. Note that in this paper we refer to n-twisted-saddle periodic orbits as saddle-type periodic orbits.</p><p>In an unconstrained setup (∂ Ω E → ∞), one could define escape streamlines as those that reach infinity. Escape region boundaries could then be obtained by intersecting the 2D separatrices of saddle points and saddle orbits with ∂ Ω M (cross-section illustration in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)), with the additional requirement that, in case of a saddle, one end of its 1D manifold connects to ∂ Ω M and the other reaches ∂ Ω E , and that in case of a saddle-type periodic orbit, both 2D manifolds connect to ∂ Ω M while at least one of its 2D manifolds reaches ∂ Ω E . This approach, to some extent, is also possible in constrained setups (with non-empty ∂ Ω E ) as long as the required critical points and periodic orbits reside within Ω. Hence, we make use of this approach for all saddle-type critical points within Ω. However, as discussed above, this approach alone (without the isocline-based approach) would be insufficient even in the unconstrained setup because boundary switch curves ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 4(d)</ref> (ii)) can also give rise to non-escape streamlines in absence of a saddle-type critical point, and bifurcation lines too. Furthermore, if a 2D manifold intersects ∂ Ω M only in one area but reaches ∂ Ω E in an other area, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4(c)</ref>, there is always an isocline surface also reaching ∂ Ω E and hence the respective escape region boundary (part) is already extracted in Sec. 3.2.2.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Discussion</head><p>We discussed in Sec. 3.2.3 that our isocline-based approach may miss 2D manifolds of critical points due to discretization issues and therefore we extract them explicitly in Sec. 3.3.1. The main difficulty with isocline-based extraction of 2D manifolds of saddle-type critical points is that the critical points are always located on the isocline surfaces and that, due to discretization issues, the erosion may fail to erode those parts of the isocline surfaces that contain the critical points. The circumstances are, however, different for saddle-type periodic orbits. A non-degenerate (i.e., not perfectly 'horizontal') periodic orbit intersects isocline surfaces only at isolated points. Hence, for reasons analogous to those discussed above with <ref type="figure">Fig. 4(c)</ref>, saddle-type periodic orbits are robustly extracted already with our isocline-based approach (see also our bifurcation line-based evaluation in Sec. 3.4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Evaluation</head><p>We first would like to provide a short comparison to previous work, i.e., to boundary switch curves and their separation surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> on the one hand, and bifurcation lines and their manifolds <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> on the other hand.

In case of 30% noise, we were not able to extract the bifurcation line (e), which can indicate the structural stability of the bifurcation line. In this case, our technique extracts only a spike, but still without disruptions, and consistent with streamline behavior (f).</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, our isocline-based approach is the only technique that robustly extracts escape maps. We conclude our evaluation by examining the structural stability of escape maps, i.e., their robustness against perturbations. At the same time this gives a notion on the numerical stability of our extraction approach. To this end, we add different levels of white noise to Eq. (1) with λ = 2 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 7)</ref>. While again, the boundary switch curve approach fails in both cases, the bifurcation manifold approach is not substantially affected with 2% noise. However, with 30% noise, we were not able to extract a bifurcation line or its manifolds. Still, our technique extracts an escape map without disruptions or other artifacts and the streamlines are consistent. Nevertheless, such an analysis can only give an impression of the structural stability versus numerical stability. Deriving the structural stability of bifurcation lines and relating them to integration error would exceed the scope of this paper. Taking into account persistence could be also a promising direction of research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS</head><p>The description of our technique was, up to now, mostly in terms of continuous concepts. Here, we provide implementation details, in particular regarding discretization. Our entire implementation works in double precision, including the parts on the GPU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Parameters</head><p>While the approach of direct sampling-based escape map extraction provides one conceptual parameter, the escape boundary ∂ Ω E , the implementation of our approach requires a few additional parameters. The primary parameter is the discretization size of the resulting escape region boundaries. It is controlled by the maximum length δ of the segments of the resulting polyline representation. This parameter is used for inserting new trajectories during streamsurface computation (Sec. 4.4). Further parameters are the step size for line integration, the cell and mesh subdivision levels for isocline extraction, the maximum number of bisection steps for trimming (erosion), and the number of subdivision steps for the extraction of critical points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Data Representation</head><p>Because our prototype operates almost entirely on the GPU and to ensure maximum performance, it supports in its present state any type of structured grid, i.e., any curvilinear grid. Nevertheless, extending the implementation for data on unstructured grids is straightforward.</p><p>The Buoyant Flow example covered in Sec. 5.1 is given on a uniform grid, while the Solar MHD data presented in Sec. 5.2 are given on spherical curvilinear grids, and the Magma Flow dataset, covered in Sec. 5.3, is also given on a spherical curvilinear grid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Line Integration</head><p>Streamline integration is an essential step in our overall approach. It is required to obtain the 1D and 2D manifolds in the vector field topology step, as well as to trim the isocline surfaces, and to compute streamsurfaces therefrom. Hence, a fast implementation is required, which we realized on the GPU using the standard fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme. The scheme is applied in computational space to exploit the topology of the structured grid and, more important, to ease the implementation and to improve the efficiency on the GPU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Streamsurface Integration</head><p>Although we provide triangulated streamsurfaces for illustration purposes of the 2D manifolds, our approach does not require an explicit surface representation. The ordered set of streamlines is sufficient to obtain the intersection curves between the streamsurfaces and ∂ Ω M . This allows us to follow the rather simple approach due to Hultquist <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, but it also allows us to omit the triangle generation step, similar to Machado et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Hence, it is sufficient to start field lines at the seeding curve and to detect if neighboring lines diverge too far from each other, i.e., if their distance exceeds δ . If this is the case, we insert additional seeds between the respective field lines, collect these seeds for efficient parallelization, and compute them in a next pass on the GPU. We employ deletion of trajectories if they become too close to each other as an optimization to improve computation time and to save memory with the resulting curves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Extraction of Critical Points</head><p>The critical points are obtained by repeated subdivision of those cells whose vertices exhibit opposite sign in all vector components. After subdivision, the centers of the cells that still satisfy the sign criterion at the final subdivision level represent the critical points. The procedure is carried out on the GPU in parallel. Critical points other than of type saddle, which are identified by opposite-sign real parts of the velocity gradient, are rejected. We follow the common practice to estimate the gradient at the grid nodes and to interpolate it at the critical points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Isocline Surface Extraction and Trimming</head><p>The isocline surfaces are extracted using the Marching Cubes algorithm on the subdivided grid. In our implementation, we subdivide all cells that are initially occupied by the isosurface to the same level. Because such a direct subdivision is computationally expensive, we do not employ too many subdivision levels. After the triangle mesh from these subdivided cells has been obtained, we perform adaptive refinement of the triangle mesh. Each triangle edge between two escape vertices is tested with recursive bisection for a rest streamline, and each triangle edge between two rest vertices is tested with recursive bisection for an escape streamline. If such a sample is found, the triangle is subdivided into four subtriangles and the process is iterated a predefined number of times. In a second pass, each triangle is tested for vertices intersected by opposite type of streamlines, i.e., it is tested if one gives rise to a rest streamline and the other to an escape streamline. If this is the case, the triangle is trimmed by repeating the recursive search and final cutting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7">Merging of Contours Using 1D Manifolds</head><p>As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figs. 8(a) and 8(b)</ref>, the streamsurface seeded at a seeding curve does not necessarily intersect ∂ Ω M along its full length, because there might be a saddle-type critical point leading to disruptions of the intersection curve between streamsurface and ∂ Ω M . This is of no relevance to the visual result, as there will be an other streamsurface converging to the critical point from an other side and providing the missing part of the escape region boundary. These two boundary parts of the escape region converge at the spikes visible in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8(b)</ref>, at the point where the 1D manifold of the critical point hits the escape region boundary. To obtain topologically connected boundary curves also in these cases, we detect if end points of escape region boundary parts are located closer than δ to an intersection between a 1D manifold and ∂ Ω M . Hence, the 1D manifolds are used to decide which end points of escape region boundaries should be merged: they are only merged if the respective seeding curves are linked via the 1D manifolds to the same critical point. But, if the escape region boundaries are only needed for display, this step can be omitted, because the end points of the curves converge extremely close to each other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">RESULTS</head><p>We demonstrate our technique on three examples with increasing computational complexity: (1) A buoyant flow based on a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation, (2) MHD-based coronal magnetic field data, (3) a flow simulation of the magma in the Earth's mantle. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> provides some timings of the shown results. We used two levels of cell subdivision for the extraction of all isocline surfaces in our results. For the MHD data, we did not employ mesh refinement, whereas, for the Magma Flow, we further employed six iterations of adaptive mesh refinement, and three iterations for the CFD data. Increasing these levels did not change the results visually (including the patterns visible on the isoclines, which reflect the trilinear interpolation of the data). For the trimming of the boundary triangles (Sec. 4.6), we employed 50 bisection steps. However, ma- chine precision was typically achieved with less than 50 iterations. For critical point extraction, we performed 20 subdivisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Buoyant Flow</head><p>The underlying dataset of the Buoyant Flow example is a CFD simulation of a closed container filled with air, which is heated at its bottom center and cooled at its top center, driving buoyant convection. The simulation grid consists of 61 × 31 × 61 nodes arranged in a Cartesian grid, with extents [0,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">0.1] × [0, 0.1] × [0, 0.05].</formula><p>In accordance with traditional vector field topology, we take a single time step of the simulation and analyze it with our streamline-based escape map concept. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref> shows our result.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Ω is set to [0, 0.1] × [0, 0.1] × [0.01, 0</formula><p>.04], i.e., the map boundary is defined at z = 0.01 while the escape boundary reaches z = 0.04. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9(a)</ref> shows the overall configuration of streamlines, isocline surfaces, and the resulting escape map. From the escape map in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref>(b) we can obtain the following insights. Our analysis reveals a system of forward (blue) and reverse (yellow) escape regions. The center of the bottom wall, where the heated plate is located, is covered by both a reverse escape region and a forward escape region, while the forward escape region is larger. This shows that hot fluid leaves the bottom boundary in a rather large area while the cold flow that comes from the top reaches the boundary in a more focused region. This example demonstrates that escape maps could be useful for the analysis of flow separation and boundary-related flow phenomena in general. Assuming that the escape boundary would lead to, e.g., open flow, the escape map could provide information where hot fluid is leaving the bottom of the chamber and hence leads to energy loss. Using a streamline probe or a set of streamlines, it would be very difficult to locate the regions at z = 0.01 that exhibit different streamline behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Solar MHD</head><p>We use solar magnetic field data from the Predictive Science Modeling Support for Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager Solar Dynamics Observatory site <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> in this example. The MAS data are available with a temporal granularity of one Carrington rotation (CR), which is the period for a complete rotation of the Sun, which is about 27 days, starting from November 9, 1853. The data are given on a spherical staggered grid with resolution 181 × 100 × 150 that exhibits increasing cell size in radial direction with increasing distance from the photosphere. In our implementation, we interpolate the staggered grid to a structured node-based spherical grid of the same resolution. With this conversion we avoid the implementation of special streamline integration code that operates on staggered grids, and we also ease the visualization of the field using standard techniques. The lower radial boundary of the MAS data resides slightly below the photosphere while the upper boundary is located at about 30 • R ⊙ (solar radii) and so does the grid of our converted data. Throughout our implementation, we use trilinear interpolation consistently, both for the magnetic field (e.g., for streamline integration) and its radial component (e.g., for isocline surface extraction).</p><p>The original idea of escape maps comes from the determination of coronal holes. In this case, the map boundary ∂ Ω M is identified with the photosphere, a sphere of radius R ⊙ , which is defined as the visible surface of the Sun. The escape boundary ∂ Ω E is set to a sphere of radius R = 2.5R ⊙ . Then, escape regions mark the coronal holes.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> the MAS data from Carrington rotation 2128 are visualized. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1(a)</ref> shows the traditional approach, i.e., by viewdependent direct sampling. From this picture, it is not possible to judge which of the regions (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) are connected. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5(a)</ref>, the topology-based extraction step provides a single curve on this side of the Sun for this dataset, while <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1(b)</ref> shows the trimmed isocline surfaces with some of the field lines seeded at their boundary curves, which generate the major part of the boundary curves of coronal holes, resulting in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1(c)</ref>. Finally, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5(b)</ref> shows that (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) are located within the same region of 'north' polarity but represent three distinguished coronal holes. Note that the boundaries of unipolar regions are identical to the ∂ Ω M -boundary of the isocline surfaces and identical to boundary switch curves. Note also that due to this fact coronal hole boundaries cannot pass boundaries of the isocline surfaces or boundary switch curves.</p><p>The regular artifacts visible on the boundary curves of trimmed isocline surfaces (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10(c)</ref>) and on the 2D manifolds (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5(a)</ref>) are due to the trilinear interpolation scheme of the original data. The same holds for the visualization (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5(b)</ref>) which is achieved by view-dependent sampling using trilinear interpolation. These interpolation effects have no impact on the technique because the same interpolation is used in all steps, i.e., from the visualization point of view, the trilinearly interpolated field represents the true field. This consistency is also illustrated by the fact that although the seeding curve in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10(c)</ref> is not smooth, the resulting intersection curve (blue) exhibits a smooth shape. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows our results for the MAS data from Carrington rotation 2131. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>(a) presents a visualization similar to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1(b)</ref>. There are two 'holes' in the escape regions (coronal holes), one to the left of the central isocline surface and one to the right. However, these two similar 'holes' are extracted differently. The left one is obtained by intersecting a 2D manifold of a saddle point, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10(b)</ref>. This is again the only 2D manifold that contributes a boundary curve on this side of the Sun. In contrast, the right 'hole' is generated by the isocline surface-based approach, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10(c)</ref>.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref>(a) illustrates two issues: the divergence of a streamsurface because it hits a critical point along its 1D manifold, and the related fact that therefore a single segment on the isocline boundary seeding curve can give rise to streamsurface parts that are mapped to two distinct escape regions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> provides a clear picture on the morphological and topological changes of the coronal holes over four Carrington rotations, in particular regarding the appearance and disappearance of corridors. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 12(e)</ref>-12(h) provide a comparison with the traditional visualization technique, which fails at resolving the thin corridors.</p><p>Morphological studies of coronal hole boundaries as observed in the soft X-ray regime by the Yohkoh telescope imply that, in some unipolar regions, coronal holes may consist of several, apparently disconnected, components (see, e.g., Kahler and Hudson <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>). Antiochos' uniqueness conjecture of coronal holes, however, states that "coronal holes are unique in that every unipolar region on the photosphere can contain at most one coronal hole" <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. The apparent disconnected coronal holes were either connected by a thin, but finite, corridor, or they are linked by "singular lines of zero width".</p><p>In our experiments, we identified cases where our technique extracted more than one disconnected coronal hole in a unipolar region, one such case is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5(b)</ref>. We examined the influence of the choice of the escape radius R e (∂ Ω E ). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows a respective result for Carrington rotation 2127. One can observe changes of the coronal holes with respect to shape and topology. For example, the coronal hole located at the image center at R e = 1.2R ⊙ thins down as  <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4(c)</ref> R e increases and represents a corridor there at R e = 1.5R ⊙ , before it vanishes for R e = 2.5R ⊙ . Using R e &gt; 2.5R ⊙ did not result in further substantial changes of the coronal holes. This contradicts Antiochos' conjecture. However, detailed investigations have to be subject of future research in the field of astrophysics and scientific visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Magma Flow</head><p>The Magma Flow dataset was obtained using CitcomS <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which is a finite element code designed to solve compressible thermochemical convection problems relevant to Earth's mantle. In contrast to the MHD dataset, the magma flow presents more complex structures like large vortical flows convecting magma between deep and surfaceproximate Earth mantle regions. The analysis of the dynamics of this flow and a mapping of mass transport between the different levels of depth inside the Earth can support the understanding of volcanic processes and the movement of plate tectonics, which can also facilitate studies about prediction of volcanic eruption or earthquakes. Here, we used a global simulation domain given on a spherical grid of resolution 315 × 157 × 24. Aiming to capture special cases of high complexities for our algorithm, and to avoid the high computation time of extracting subdivided isocline surfaces for such a large and complex dataset, we setup the map and escape boundaries as two spheres of radii R M = 0.8R ⊕ (earth radii) and R E = 0.9R ⊕ . In this configuration, we could capture some cases of vortices intersecting ∂ Ω M , for example, the case shown in Figs. 8(c), 8(d), and 13. To this dataset, we have applied cell subdivision and adaptive mesh subdivision with depths two and six, respectively. For integration, we performed a maximum of three thousand steps of size 0.0005. Note that this dataset has higher resolution than the Buoyant Flow dataset and it also needs even deeper mesh subdivision. Both yields in a computation time of about two and a half hours for the extraction of its trimmed isocline surfaces.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>We have presented a technique for topologically correct and robust extraction of escape maps, which show if a streamline emanating from a given position on the map in forward or reverse direction leaves an adjacent, arbitrarily-shaped simply-connected region. The concept of escape maps was inspired from astrophysics, where it is equivalent to the problem of extracting coronal holes on the Sun's photosphere. In contrast to the traditional approach that discretizes the map and therefore suffers from discretization issues, our approach builds on isocline surfaces of the vector field to obtain a seeding tailored at the topologically correct extraction of escape maps. Our approach provides several benefits. First and most important, it is able to extract very narrow map structures, in contrast to the traditional approach that suffers severely from aliasing. This becomes particularly obvious in case of the extraction of coronal hole corridors, which are missed by traditional approaches and are subject to current research in astrophysics.</p><p>Second, it performs field line integration in these cases in the more stable direction toward the map boundary, avoiding prohibitive accumulation of integration error. The concept of escape maps is closely related to vector field topology on bounded domains. Nevertheless, in our understanding, further research is necessary to clearly determine possible links and properties between these two concepts, and if escape maps could provide a basis for such a vector field topology. Finally, we hope to inspire future research on the connection between isocline surfaces and topological features, and to call attention to isocline surfaces for scientific visualization in general.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Machado, Filip Sadlo, Member, IEEE, Thomas Müller, and Thomas Ertl, Member, IEEE Escape maps at the example of coronal hole extraction.
