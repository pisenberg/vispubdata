				<p>Change blindness occurs when people do not notice changes in visible elements of a scene. If people use an information visualization system to compare document collection subsets partitioned by their time-stamps, change blindness makes it impossible for them to recognize even very major changes, let alone minor ones. We describe theories from cognitive science that account for the change blindness phenomenon, as well as solutions developed for two visual analysis tools, a dot plot (SPIRE Galaxies) and landscape (ThemeView™) visualizations.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Background</head><p>Information visualization systems portray a scene to communicate key elements of an information collection, such as similarity, metadata, and change over time. The scene's design and the mapping of information attributes to visual portrayal depend on many considerations, such as user context and information needs, human perception and cognition capabilities, the nature of the collection, and the display capabilities at hand. One tradeoff inherent in the design of such visualizations is a choice between adding a second visual portrayal or communicating more information with an existing one. For example, many visualizations use a 2-or 3D scene to portray similarity and metadata in a collection of documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</p><p>To portray change over time, one could add a complementary visualization or incorporate the additional data to the existing one; in some cases, a combination of the two might be preferred. A simple method for showing time change within an existing portrayal is to filter what is shown by the selected time period and then update the display as the time period changes. This method has two undesirable effects. First, if the display change is abrupt, the user may experience change blindness, making the changes hard to recognize. Second, even if the change is smooth, the larger context of the currently displayed information is lost. This paper describes methods for adding portrayal of change to two different visualizations, one based on a dot-plot portrayal and the second based on a landscape metaphor. We also describe a third approach, using an added visualization whose sole function is to represent change.</p><p>The systems we address are aimed at helping users perform tasks of information triage, choosing which documents and information phenomena within large collections and steady streams of content deserve attention. The primary goal of information visualization is to help users glean insight from large collections of information, including text documents. SPIRE (Spatial Paradigm for Information Retrieval and Exploration) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref> was explicitly designed to help analysts reduce the amount of time they spend monitoring information sources and increase the time they spend analyzing the content of large document collections and understanding the issues reported. The original motivation for SPIRE came from information analysts, who face significant challenges dealing with the growing amount of information, most of it unstructured text. SPIRE automatically produces a suitable knowledge base of topics (similar to keywords) that distinguish among groups within the document collection under analysis. It then creates n-dimensional vectors that characterize each document with respect to those topics. The document vectors are clustered and projected from n-space into 2-space; the 2D projection is used to create the visual representations.</p><p>The SPIRE ThemeView™ visualization ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) depicts the topical content of a collection as a landscape, where hills and mountains represent strong emphasis on one or more closely related concepts-the higher the peak, the stronger the emphasis on that theme or group of themes. Color also reflects the strength of emphasis on themes. The tops of peaks that represent the strongest theme concentrations are very bright yellow. Moderately strong themes are red, and themes with minimal strength are blue. The colors are blended, so that a single high mountain will shade from blue at the base to red to bright yellow at the top. This visualization is particularly good for helping analysts jump-start their understanding of the collection -it conveys the main themes in a collection and an overall sense of how they are related.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. SPIRE ThemeView visualization</head><p>The SPIRE Galaxies visualization, which is reminiscent of the night sky, is shown with the same data set in <ref type="figure">Figure  2</ref>. This visualization represents each document as a small green dot; the collection as a whole looks like a universe of "docustars." Closely related documents cluster together in a tight group while unrelated documents are separated by large space. Larger open orange circles represent cluster centers. The distance between points indicates their thematic similarity. Thus, if points in the visualization are close together, then it is likely that the corresponding documents contain thematically similar information. If they are far apart, the documents probably are thematically diverse. For our users, this is effectively like related documents automatically sorting into the correct piles. Similar approaches are seen, for example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2. SPIRE Galaxies visualization</head><p>Determining the relative age of documents is often important to our users, as they seek to recognize emerging events and trends in a collection. SPIRE's Time Slicer functions as an automated sequential query. That is, the user specifies a range of time (e.g., 1 day or 3 months) and the system selects information objects that fall within the current window, while progressing through the collection by essentially moving the selection window. A new range may overlap an old one, so that a range with 3day intervals for a 4-day collection will have 2 windows that overlap for 2 days. The Time Slicer can also be set to increment the displayed information objects by gradually adding documents for additional time periods.</p><p>The Galaxies Time Slicer, shown with its controls in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 3 and 4</ref>, presents a separate window that maps time to a histogram, where each bar in the histogram shows the number of documents for a particular period of time. If the user selects two or more bars in the control window, only the documents for those time periods are shown in the Galaxies window. The user can move the selection window from one period to another or progressively expand it. The dots representing individual documents come and go with selection or deselection of the time slice in which they fall, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> depicting time slices for each of 3 consecutive days. There is no visible way to distinguish which icons belong to which time period other than their appearance or disappearance in response to user action. There is no visual distinctiveness to the new documents and no representation at all of older documents that have fallen outside the current time slice and thus vanished from the display. This makes it difficult for users to remember relative age of documents, particularly in large data sets, and impossible to capture the knowledge in a still image. Furthermore, multiple images are not available at once. It is also difficult to detect trends in the collection.  Similar problems occur with the SPIRE ThemeView Time Slicer. In this Time Slicer, changes to the landscape occur when the selection window in time changes. This may mean that new peaks appear and old ones vanish or, more commonly, that the height and color of peaks change subtly during progression through the collection. The problem is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, showing data from 3 different days. As with the Galaxies Time Slicer, users must rely on memory to recognize how the ThemeView landscape changes from one slice to the next. The problem is even worse when users attempt to identify trends in the collection, so they must remember a sequence of changes.</p><p>SPIRE users experience change blindness when they are using the Time Slicer and find themselves unable to identify what has changed from one time period, or slice, to the next, or when they are unable to remember what was different in the previous slice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Change Blindness</head><p>Change blindness is a well-known problem in human visual perception that occurs when people do not notice changes in visible elements of a scene <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. This phenomenon is studied under multiple rubrics, including change detection and inattentional blindness <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Change blindness may occur even when changes to the scene are fairly dramatic, such as changing the person to whom a subject is speaking during an interruption or making major changes in the color or arrangement of objects. Psychologists noted the problem of change blindness as early as 1953 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Increasing interest has led to numerous studies of the phenomenon in recent years, some of which are discussed below.</p><p>Researchers have developed several different explanations for the occurrence of change blindness, a few of which we discuss here <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">• Overwriting • First impressions • Nothing is stored • Nothing is compared • Feature combination</formula><p>Overwriting is believed to occur when the mental representation of a scene is blanked out during an interval or is wholly replaced by the mental representation of the new scene. In this widely accepted view, any changes to the scene are undetectable unless the observer had already abstracted information about the changed element, because the observer has no basis for comparison. "When the new visual information comes along, it simply replaces the old … leaving only the abstract representations of the initial display. Accordingly, successful change detection occurs only for the attended objects, and even then, it may be limited to a comparison of abstracted information rather than of visual representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>." The theory of first impressions suggests that "observers accurately encode the features of the initial object or scene and then fail to encode the details of the changed scene (which is often the current percept) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>." Proponents of this model [9,10, and others] suggest that the primary goal of scene perception is to understand the meaning of the scene. If changes in the scene do not affect the meaning, then there is no benefit in changing the mental representation of the scene.</p><p>The related theory that nothing is stored suggests that it is unnecessary for observers to develop any mental representation of the scene, because the world itself is sufficient representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Because no details of a scene are stored in the observer's memory, there is no basis for comparison when elements of the scene are changed. Thus, changes are undetectable.</p><p>Another theory suggests that observers do store a complete mental image of scene elements, but nothing is compared between the old and new representations when changes are made <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Because no comparison occurs, no changes are detected. Research does suggest that there are memory traces of the old representation and that changes can be detected if the observer is asked to do so <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Note that failure to attend, suggested as a cause for change blindness <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, may also lead to failing to compare. Recent work suggests that observer attention must be focused specifically on the item that changes for recognition of change to be assured <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</p><p>An older and generally discredited theory of feature combination suggested that "two consecutive views are overlain and combined" in memory, so that essentially "observers are unable to keep the two views separate, and partial representations of each are combined to form a new, 'coherent' representation of the scene <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>."</p><p>A more thorough discussion of change blindness is beyond the scope of this paper. For a comprehensive review, refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Portraying Document Age in the Galaxies Visualization</head><p>Analysts reviewing the time sequence of documents in a collection are often interested in quickly identifying the most recent documents. These should easily stand out. The other documents' relative age should be apparent, but it need not map to easily identifiable absolute age. Thus we wanted a graphical representation that allows the newest documents to be seen pre-attentively, while the other document ages can be intuitively ordered. We sought a way for users to quickly identify changes as they step through a data set's timeline.</p><p>Pre-attentive features are visual aspects of objects that are perceived very quickly, almost instantaneously, regardless of the number of objects in view <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. In SPIRE, as in many other dot-plot visualization systems, several pre-attentive graphical attributes are already used for representing other information, making those attributes less suitable for portraying age. The spatial layout of the icons represents similarity among the documents. Color may represent group membership, selection, or metadata values. Size is not a good choice, because the large number of document icons makes occlusion a concern. Similarly, most shapes are problematic, because they may also increase occlusion. Therefore, we sought a method to portray relative document age among many documents in the presence of constraints on the possible encodings.</p><p>We developed a prototype to simulate time-stamped documents in a Galaxies-style display, allowing us to research alternatives. The prototype mapped document age optionally to any set from the following:</p><p>• angles from 90 degrees to 0</p><p>• line length • color progression (such as yellow to green to blue)</p><p>• bright to dim progression • perspective depth • left to right spatial progression. The prototype was designed to operate with a set of newswire documents. The timeline for the entire document set is divided into a series of equal segments (time slices). At any given moment, the visualization represents a window of time consisting of some number of slices. This window can be moved back and forth through time, one slice per step.</p><p>Along with line angle, we experimented with spatial progression for age encoding based on the general layout of the documents under the Galaxies projection. The prototype allows 3D rotation, enabling several different visual effects. For example, in one view, we use perspective depth to make it seem that as documents age, they recede into the center of the screen (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 7)</ref>, or that they spread to the edges (not shown). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 7</ref>, color, line and length redundantly encode age. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure  7</ref>, color, line and length redundantly encode age.</p><p>Rotating to a third orientation simulates a situation where the 2D projection of Galaxies is conceptually placed in a plane perpendicular to the user's line of sight and on one edge of the screen . Then the documents seem to move across the screen toward the projection plane, landing in their final locations and building up the Galaxies view over time.</p><p>Such spatial progressions have interesting effects. However, based on user feedback, we chose not to override the inherent meaning of the documents' spatial location by using such techniques for age encoding.</p><p>The solution we adopted was to use line angle and length to portray document age, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 8</ref>. Angle is a pre-attentive feature that is less commonly used and that proved very effective for this application. A vertical line can be identified pre-attentively among a set of lines whose angle differs sufficiently either to the right or to the left <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. The other graphical encoding options were deemed too conflicting with other encodings used in SPIRE. Note that in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 8</ref>, glyph colors represent group membership, as indicated by the legend.</p><p>We conducted a simple formative usability evaluation of this solution for encoding age in a dot plot with two participants who were already familiar with SPIRE. Our goal was to see if the users could easily understand the age encoding, use it to identify the newest documents, and compare relative ages across a small set of time slices. Participants were asked to carry out a series of simple tasks, such as selecting documents from particular time periods and identifying which of two documents was more recent. Without age encoding, participants had to change the time window to answer the questions. With age encoding, they could modify the time window or interpret the line angle and size. Both participants opted to interpret the encoding, though in dense regions of the screen they sometimes needed to zoom in to compensate for over-plotting.  Participants were able to correctly interpret and use the age encoding for all questions asked. In answer to a subjective questionnaire, both said that identifying relative document age was easier with the encoding and that the encoding added to their interpretation of the dot plot view. Both indicated that they were very likely to use this age encoding if it were incorporated into an application.</p><p>These capabilities have been implemented in a new version of SPIRE, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 8</ref>, with the same data used for <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>. The new Galaxies Time Slicer allows the user to turn on or off age encoding. In the current implementation, we use a vertical line to portray new documents. Based on guidance from a local human factors expert, we have used a minimum difference of 15 degrees between the vertical (and most recent) slice and the previous slice. Earlier slices are shown at progressively smaller angles ending at a horizontal (0 degree) for the oldest slice displayed.</p><p>We are currently using an exponential decay function to control the angle differences between 75 and 0 degrees. This gives us the desired behavior, where new slices are easily distinguished and older slices can be compared relative to each other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Candidate Solutions for ThemeView</head><p>A solution to the change blindness problem for the SPIRE ThemeView Time Slicer should meet two criteria:</p><p>• The user should be able to see where the new landscape contours will be while the old contours are still visible. This is needed to make the capability more useful for analysis. • At any point during the change, the user should be able to determine which landscape contours are emerging and which are vanishing, so that a screen capture or printout of the display can be correctly interpreted. We investigated several techniques for drawing attention to changes from one time slice to another:</p><p>• Morphing • Cross-fading • Using a wireframe in combination with changes in color and translucency. Morphing is a technique that creates intermediate steps between two images by taking some data from each image to create each intermediate step. Changing the ratio of data from each image allows creation of a sequence of images that gradually becomes less like the first image and more like the second. When animated, the sequence has the appearance of motion. For example, if a particular ThemeView location is low in one slice and high in the next, the intermediate steps will show that location as appearing to smoothly grow. This apparent motion makes the areas of change noticeable, but at any given time it is not possible to tell what came before or what will eventually appear, nor can the viewer determine which charac-teristics came from which image. Furthermore, morphing does not help the user remember the changes.</p><p>Cross-fading also depends on using both the first and second Time Slice images. While the first image is present, a very pale, translucent version of the second is added in. The first image grows progressively dimmer and more translucent while the second becomes progressively brighter and more opaque, with the process ending when the first image has completely vanished and the second has reached full brilliance and opacity. This technique allows the user to see the two states at once, but the user must remember where in the process the system is at any given moment. That is, if we capture the image on the screen at any point in time, it is not apparent which parts of the image will get brighter and which will fade away -the user cannot tell which direction the process will go.</p><p>The solution that we recommend, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 9</ref>, involves several simultaneous patterns of subtle change in the visual display that we believe address all of the suspected causes of change blindness. We use a white wireframe for the emerging contours. The wireframe appears as soon as the transition from one image begins. At the same time, we begin reducing the opacity and color saturation of the vanishing contours. The emerging contours, shown by the wireframe, begin to fill with translucent color that gradually becomes brighter and less translucent. At the same time, the vanishing contours become progressively dimmer and more translucent. When the emerging image reaches opacity, the wireframe vanishes and the old image has completely faded away.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Use of this combination of techniques</head><p>• Draws attention to the areas of change • Shows elements of both the old (vanishing) and new (emerging) image at all times, so there is no reliance on the user's memory for access to this information • Uses different graphical methods for the old and the new, so that it is possible to distinguish between them at any point in time; the visual difference also facilitates comparison and thus detection/recognition of what has changed Of the single-window solutions we investigated, this is the only one that meets all of our criteria for design success. Though we have not yet had the opportunity to conduct a usability evaluation for the design, we have received positive feedback from people to whom we have demonstrated the initial animated mock-up. We have therefore implemented this solution in a standalone prototype that works with data from a SPIRE data set.</p><p>ThemeScan, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 10</ref>, is a completely different approach to the change blindness problem, using three distinct windows: one for the old set, one for the new, and one that "scans" the difference between the two. The user sets anchoring endpoints for the scan line in the first ThemeView window, which shows the older data, and a scan line connects the two endpoints. A scan line also appears in the second window, depicting the Theme-View with the later data, at the corresponding location. The third window, the ThemeScan, shows a graph with lines representing the cross-section of both ThemeViews at the scan-line. As the user drags the scan line across the ThemeView, the cross-sections represented in the Theme-Scan window change to reflect the new position.  With this approach, there is no reliance on the user's memory of either the old or new ThemeView, because both are present in separate windows. There is no perceptual or memory burden for comparing the two, because differences in the contours can be examined in the separate profile lines of ThemeScan window.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Related Work</head><p>Rather than attempt to summarize all the work in the area of temporal displays, we concentrate here on the particular problems addressed by this work. The problem illustrated by the Galaxy design is a dot plot where the dot locations are determined by other variables and may not be used to convey time. One method for showing time in a fixed-position dot plot is to show only a single time frame, which varies either under user control or under some preset time elapse. Dynamic queries <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> are based on this approach. With dynamic query filters, as the user moves slider controls, the document icons are immediately shown or hidden, to match the date range selected.</p><p>For dot plot displays, assigning particular object attributes, such as date, to graphical attributes, such as color, size, or shape is another common technique. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, Nowell surveys recommendations on encoding choices and describes the Envision system, which lets a user interactively assign document metadata to various possible encodings. She also reports results of an experiment comparing particular individual and combination encodings that she tested using that system.</p><p>Littlefield &amp; Nicholson <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> developed a technique using encoding and animation to show multiple slices of data at a time, using color in a looping video display. Current dot positions are shown in white, future positions red, and past positions yellow. The slices are shown in sequence, looping through 11 data slices, with the encodings mapped accordingly at each step. They conclude that the combination works better than showing only the current slice values at each step, because the latter requires more memory load on the users.</p><p>The problem illustrated by the ThemeView example is to show time changes between two (or a series of) complex surfaces. One possible approach is to show all images in the series at the same time, as in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> and as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>Animation for change has been incorporated into many systems (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>). MacEachren <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> provides an excellent discussion of animation for cartographic and geographic displays, including potential user controls of the animation display.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>We have described several methods for addressing the problem of change blindness in SPIRE's Galaxies and ThemeView Time Slicers. Change blindness is a sig-nificant problem for information visualization systems whenever user tasks require recognition of differences between two or more images, scenes, or video frames.</p><p>Continuing research on change blindness is significant for developers of information visualization systems because it is leading to new theories about how vision works, how we build and maintain internal models of the world, and what information these models contain <ref type="bibr">[17, 26 22]</ref>. In particular, the completeness of our internalized information is called into question. Furthermore, the importance of focused attention as a factor in perception is strongly supported by a number of studies <ref type="bibr">[26, 23, 24, etc.]</ref>. One theory suggests that change that occurs late in the exploration of a scene is less likely to be detected <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. One recent study suggests that domain-specific knowledge increases sensitivity to change <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Observer interest also seems to be a factor in determining which information about a scene is internalized <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. These and other emerging theories about change blindness and perception represent opportunities to improve the effecttiveness of information visualization systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>SPIRE Galaxies filtered by the Time Slicer</figDesc></figure>
