<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Motivation</head><p>Nonlinear magnification <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> is a general term used to describe the properties of a broad collection of techniques that have gone under the names of fisheye views <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, fo-cus+context <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, continuously variable zoom <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and others. These techniques have a rich history spanning a large number of application types, including viewing structured text <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, graph layout <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, and viewing image/map data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. A feature that is common to most of these systems is that they have tended to be used as stand-alone tools for viewing data in isolation, rather than as techniques to complement existing high-level visualization paradigms. This paper will explore ways in which nonlinear magnification can be used in conjunction with other paradigms, and show how the composition of focus+context techniques with other visualization paradigms can allow them to build on each others' strengths and reduce their weaknesses, thus providing a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts. Our underlying philosophy is that nonlinear magnification can be used to complement existing paradigms, rather than compete with them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Composing Visual Paradigms</head><p>In this section we will explore the composition of nonlinear magnification techniques with two other popular information visualization paradigms: pan&amp;zoom and treemaps. The nonlinear magnification routines used here are based on the nonlinear transformation pipeline first described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. That work described a 2D nonlinear magnifying transformation Ø as transforming points in a domain , such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Ü ¼ Ý ¼ µ Ø´Ü Ýµ.</formula><p>In subsequent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, we developed a method for measuring the effects of any nonliner trans-formation over an entire domain via an area-based derivative computation of a magnification field. These magnification fields can be computed for any given transformation (independent of the system used to produce the transformation), and their values are well defined over the entire domain (rather than simply at the point of focus, or as simple distance functions limited to single focus systems).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Pan&amp;Zoom with Focus+Context</head><p>The pan&amp;zoom paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> has been in widespread use for some time now in different forms. The paradigm offers advantages of being intuitive to the user and allowing high levels of distortion free zooming. When combined with filtering techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, such systems offer the potential for interaction with almost limitless amounts of data in an infinite space. This large data-space can cause navigational difficulties however, through loss of context when "zoomed into" the view, and loss of detail when "zoomed out" of the view. Recent research has made strides towards addressing these navigational difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, to which we would add the current effort.</p><p>Pan&amp;Zoom systems provide the ability to manipulate the global magnification (scale) of a view to a very high degree, whereas focus+context systems provide the ability to selectively change the local magnification within a view. Thus the composition of these two systems can be seen as global+local magnification. This allows the user to use local magnification to "probe" a given view for regions of interest before committing to a full zoom on that region, thus preventing the loss of context that the normal zoom operation would entail. This preservation of context is particularly important for navigating in an exploratory environment where the user may be uncertain on which direction to take within a data-space. By using multiple local magnification lenses (as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and other works) the user can also probe multiple regions simultaneously, something that is not possible with a traditional pan&amp;zoom system.</p><p>The spatial characteristics of a pan&amp;zoom system can be implemented via manipulation of a 4-tuple Î Ü Ñ Ò Ý Ñ Ò Ü Ñ Ü Ý Ñ Ü representing a basic viewport transformation. A pan&amp;zoom operation Ô (either panning or zooming) will cause a transformation on this 4-tuple:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Î ¼ Ô´Î µ.</formula><p>To compose this pan&amp;zoom system with our system for nonlinear magnification <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, we note that the default domain for our nonlinear transformations is rectangular, and can be described by a 4-tuple in the exact same way as Î. Thus the systems can be composed simply by setting Î so that: ¼ Ô´ µ. Only minor changes to our nonlinear magnification system are required to scale the local lens size relative to the global scale.</p><p>This composition of global and local magnification has the nice property that the resolution of the transformation grid (used for local magnification) remains constant with respect to the current viewport transformation Î, even as the global magnification levels change. One of the difficulties encountered by grid-based approximations to nonlinear transformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> is that the maximum level of local magnification is limited by the resolution of the grid. This limitation has two aspects: a grid cell at the center of magnification will continue to increase magnification only up until its defining boundary points get pushed into the context area and will then cease to increase magnification, and as the cell grows it inceases the significance of interpolation within the cell so that the transformation appears chunky rather than continuous. These difficulties with high levels of local magnification can be partially addressed through the use of high-resolution grids, however they are more properly addressed through the use of multiresolution grid methods (an example of which is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>). This method of mapping Î onto is a simple resampling mechanism that provides the effect of a multiresolution grid, thus allowing local magnification at any scale.</p><p>We have implemented a system for global+local magnification, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. For the local magnification tool, we have chosen a round magnification lens with a distortion-free region of linear magnification in the middle and a smooth transition between magnified and unmagnified regions. This allows the user to probe down within regions at local magnification factors of up to 8X or higher while still preserving a static context area in which to navigate. Additional types of local magnification lenses are possible, and the user has complete control over the size of lens and degree of magnification. A single click causes the local magnification lens to pop up on the display for use by the user (a semi-transparent grid overlay is used to show the user the transformation that has been applied). When the user finds a region of interest, another single click will cause the system to pan the center of that region into the center of the viewport, and will zoom the system in an amount equal to the local magnification. The local magnification is smoothed out <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> until all distortion is removed and only the identity transformation remains. All of these actions after the click are interpolated and animated simultaneously, so that the user smoothly transitions to the new view. At this point, the local lens can be deployed again for further exploration and zooming. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows three stages of this process: the first image shows the normal view of a map of Portsmouth NH, the middle view shows a local lens focused on a peninsular region of Portsmouth in the upper right, and the final view shows the view panned and zoomed on the region of interest. The zoom bars on the images allow the user to control the pan and zoom parameters, and also provide visual feedback to the user for their current position in the overall dataspace. This global+local magnification system offers advantages in terms of preservation of context while probing for regions of interest. In addition, it offers a simple navigation mechanism for the pan&amp;zoom paradigm. When the user clicks to zoom in on a region of interest, the relevant panning and zooming operations are collapsed into a single animated operation, thus freeing the user of having to manipulate the panning and zooming operations independently. This interaction mode is similar to how clicking on discrete objects in Pad++ <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> works, however it is more generically based on spatial selection than object selection.</p><p>A final issue involving the composition of global and local magnification systems involves the implementation of filtering. Much of the power of pan&amp;zoom systems comes from their ability to filter out information that is above or below the threshold of visibility. Fortunately it is a relatively straightforward matter to continue this type of filtering in the global+local magnification system. Because the magnification fields described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> are well defined over the entire domain it requires only a simple lookup operation to determine the local magnification Ð for a given point, this can be multiplied by the global magnification to get the absolute scale for any point in the domain. This type of filtering (along with how to position and embed discrete objects within a nonlinearly transformed space) was demonstrated in the interactive travel atlas described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Fisheye Treemaps</head><p>Treemaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> are another popular paradigm for information visualization that have been widely used in different variations. Treemaps can be used to lay out entire hierarchies within a fixed amount of display space by subdividing that space to reflect branches in the hierarchy. As the number of nodes becomes very large however, it may not be possible to display all of them in the desired level of detail, as they get packed into potentially sub-pixel sized areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In order to address this limitation, zooming was introduced in a later version <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> so that any node could be designated as the root node of a new hierarchy, which would then be displayed at maximum scale. It is interesting to note that this zooming mechanism is spatially equivalent to a (possibly non-uniform) pan&amp;zoom operation that brings the current viewport parameters into alignment with the bounding box of the selected node. For both the pan&amp;zoom and treemap operations, the zooming operation will necessarily cause a loss of context.</p><p>We can compose nonlinear magnification with treemaps (fisheye treemaps) to enhance detail in regions of interest without the loss of context entailed by full zoom methods. This has been implemented here through the mechanism of seamless multilevel views <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows two treemap views of a stock portfolio at different levels of detail 1 (additional levels of detail can be easily added WLOG). We are using these images as textures representing discrete levels in our multilevel view system. Due to the rectangular nature of the data, we have chosen an orthogonal nonlinear step transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> that allows independent magnification along each axis, and preserves horizontal and vertical lines. The user can control the degree of magnification interactively, and the stepwise nature of the transformation allows the central region of local magnification to be distortion free. Alternative versions with constrained lenses and/or multiple regions of magnification are also possible, <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Two views of a stock portfolio. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> These images were obtained using the TreeMap97 implementation available at www.cs.umd.edu/hcil, and are used with permission of the Human-Computer Interaction Lab, University of Maryland An example of fisheye treemaps is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. When the user first looks at the treemap, it has no local magnification and appears as the lower detailed "black and white" image on the left of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Local magnification is subsequently applied centering on the leftmost node labeled "Portfolio 2", producing <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. This magnification pulls in more details from the higher detailed "colored" view in a seamless fashion, including additional sub-hierarchies. For example, we can now see that the "Portfolio 2" node in question includes a large portion of computer stocks including Compaq, Cray, DEC, and Unisys. The context of the surrounding areas are shown at reduced scale, still providing the viewer with a sense of the overall structure of the hierarchy and the location of their locally magnified region within it. This particular implementation of a fisheye treemap provides interaction with static treemap views, however given access to the treemap software it could be extended to handle dynamic data with user selection of nodes and properties to display. One approach to doing this would be to have the treemap software draw it's images directly to texture memory where the multi-level view data resides(these texture images could be much larger than available screen space). User interaction with the resulting view can then be mapped back into the original treemap coordinates via the OpenGL picking mechanism, along with information about the local magnification to determine the view level that is being acted on. An alternative approach would be to modify the treemap software to apply the nonlinear transformation to the node coordinates directly before they are drawn to the screen, which would allow dynamically adapting the LOD within hierarchies based upon the local magnification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Discussion</head><p>All of the examples in this paper used the nonlinear magnification toolkit described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for producing the localized magnification transformations. It is possible that other magnification systems could be used as well, although the complexity of our compositions was simplified greatly by the simple 2D nature of the toolkit we used. This toolkit is also capable of more sophisticated methods for indicating localized scale levels to the user via shading <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, which may enhance the effectiveness of the composition.</p><p>Nonlinear magnification is very generic and spatial in nature, and is not tied to any specific data type that is being visualized. This lends itself well to being used as an "overlay operation" that can be composed with other more specific paradigms. Our applications show how nonlinear magnification can be used as a complementary tool to existing visualization systems by providing additional support for navigation and exploration. Related work <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> described a specific case of integrating a fisheye graph algorithm with pan&amp;zoom for exploring software structures. In addition to being used as a lens to navigate and enhance views of existing data, implicit magnification fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> are suitable for use as a "driving mechanism" for LOD, dynamic retrieval, and rollup/drilldown operations. Recent work exploring these issues includes nonlinearly magnified travel atlases <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and selective rendering of graph structures based on their proximity to the center of a hyperbolic space <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. More generally, nonlinear magnification can be seen as a continuous version of the Magic Lens <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> paradigm, providing a continuum of values over the view domain rather than a binary selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper we have shown how the generic spatial nature of nonlinear magnification is well suited as an "overlay" operation that can be composed with other high-level visualization paradigms. While much previous work has emphasized the use of nonlinear magnification as a standalone visualization tool, the examples here demonstrate how it is also suitable for providing exploration and navigation support within those other paradigms.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Global+Local Magnification Sequence: initial view, view with local magnification of ROI in upper right, view panned and zoomed on ROI with local magnification smoothed out.</figDesc></figure>
