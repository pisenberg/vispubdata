				<p>This paper proposes a new visualization and interaction technique for medium-sized trees, called Collapsible Cylindrical Trees (CCT). Child nodes are mapped on rotating cylinders, which will be dynamically displayed or hidden to achieve a useful balance of detail and context. Besides a comprehensible threedimensional visualization of trees, the main feature of CCT is a very fast and intuitive interaction with the displayed nodes. Only a single click is needed to reach every node and perform an action on it, such as displaying a web page. The CCT browsing technique was developed for interaction with web hierarchies but is not limited to this domain. We also present sample implementations of CCT using VRML, which show the usefulness of this intuitive tree navigation technique.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>With the widespread use of internet technologies and the availability of huge information spaces on the world wide web, fast navigation becomes one of the crucial tasks. Since hierarchical structures like organizational or web structures, product catalogues, or book chapters are omnipresent, they need to be visualized on the web, too. Moreover, a fast access of web pages, products, or content is of high importance in addition to the presentation. It can be noticed, that structured information of this type is often organized in a strictly hierarchical format or can be easily converted to trees. That is why visualization and particularly navigation of trees are the focus of this work. Web page hierarchies shall serve as a prominent example of a structured representation of hierarchical data.</p><p>A number of web navigation techniques were developed, among them sitemaps in different formats to facilitate overview and quick navigation within web pages. The spectrum ranges from simple textual enumeration to traditional menus and even sophisticated hyperbolic visualizations. In the field of threedimensional graph and tree visualization various interesting approaches were suggested, usually to display large hierarchies with the added benefits of the third dimension. However, these techniques are only sparingly used for real navigation tasks in the world wide web.</p><p>On one hand this was due to the lack of powerful 3D graphics capabilities of consumer platforms in the past. Meanwhile this has changed, though the problem of various proprietary 3D formats and plug-ins still prevent easy access to 3D internet applications. On the other hand the traditional 3D visualization techniques are often optimized for huge hierarchies and thus difficult to navigate for non-expert users.</p><p>To overcome the complexity of these solutions and still take advantage of the capabilities of threedimensional visualization and interaction paradigms, we developed a comprehensible 3D navigation technique called Collapsible Cylindrical Trees (CCT). It allows a very fast navigation in medium-sized hierarchies. Though it was developed especially for web applications, it is not limited to this application domain. As opposed to many other approaches our goal has not been to get insight into complex hierarchies but basically to quickly navigate through trees and perform an associated action on a node, such as opening a web page.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows: The second section relates our work to previous approaches and motivates the development of our technique. Then, we introduce CCT in detail, followed by a discussion of typical application scenarios of this novel technique in section 4. Insight into implementation details is given in section 5, followed by a conclusion and outline of future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Much research has been dedicated to the visualization of trees as a special type of graph. Most of the work concentrated on the challenge to display large hierarchies in a comprehensible form. As Herman et al. describe it in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, these approaches tried to overcome the disadvantages of visualizing large hierarchies, such as reduced performance, viewability, and usability. In our opinion particularly the last disadvantage, lack of intuitive interaction, must be solved not only for huge but primarily for medium-sized hierarchies. Consider for example common menu systems or program menus. We must notice, that they often provide very long lists of items. Therefore long vertical mouse movements are needed to reach deeper nested entries. We tried to eliminate these deficiencies in the CCT approach with mapping different labels on a cylinder. This known idea is a useful amendment to two-dimensional menu systems, where vertical space is either limited or too many menu entries are presented at once. Mobile phones with limited displays are a recent example showing this technique.</p><p>Classical tree layouts are top-down or left-to-right views, H-trees, radial views, balloon views, tree-maps, onion graphs, and various modifications based on these forms. The survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> lists detailed references to these approaches. A few of them do not use screen space efficiently <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Our CCT approach combines three traditional layouts to maximize use of available display size: a top-down view for the first tree level with a radial approach for siblings of a node and a left-to-right view for children of a branching node. Approaches such as tree maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> focus on the content information of nodes and criticize the text only approach of other node and link diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. We suggest that both aspects, clear textual description of nodes and additional graphical cues to content should be provided by a visualization. Moreover, with web page hierarchies the internal or branching nodes are equally important to the leaf nodes and must be displayed in the same meaningful way. Approaches like tree maps, which basically display leaf nodes, are inadequate in this respect.</p><p>Various 3D approaches were developed to display larger hierarchies or reduce visual clutter, such as cone trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and augmented solutions. Some of them are based on 2D tree layouts, like the information cube <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Other problems occur with 3D visualizations, like object occlusion, difficult view adjustment <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, performance problems, as well as bad readability of 3D texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. We took these problems into consideration while developing CCT and cautiously used 3D graphics. In addition to that many of the 3D approaches concentrate on conveying a sense of structural relations, whereas in our approach the interaction with nodes and high-quality text display play a more important role. So especially the task of browsing a hierarchical structure is supported by CCT.</p><p>The horizontally oriented Navigation Cones in LyberWorld <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> improved on text readability and influenced our solution. Their successor, visual trees, is a generalization of the LyberWorld search trees. They solve the problem of too many sibling nodes with the help of a spiral display instead of evenly distributing them at the circular base of a cone. Although spiral trees are very elegant, occlusion still occurs and space remains limited. The CCT concept of endless cylinders tries to improve on that.</p><p>There also exists a variety of Focus+Context extensions to 2D and 3D visualizations like the hyperbolic browser <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> or hyperbolic cone trees for large directed graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> shows a hyperbolic web sitemap of our research group, the Heinz-Nixdorf Endowed Chair for Multimedia Technology (MMT). The problem with hyperbolic displays is again interaction. Due to the always-changing position of the nodes it is very hard to build up muscle memory and avoid unnecessary mouse movements.</p><p>The review of Benford et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> considers threedimensional visualization techniques of the world wide web. Among them one can find a 3D hyperbolic visualization of sections of the World Wide Web <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> based on cone trees. The Harmony Internet Browser included a 3D visualization and navigation facility called information landscape, where document hierarchies were represented as blocks mapped onto a plane <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. These and other approaches are again aimed at visualizing large hierarchies and are more difficult to comprehend in terms of 3D structure. They clearly focus on structures and revealing relationships among web pages instead of fast navigation and interaction. We tried to solve the cognitive difficulties of 3D navigation in the CCT approach, where one of the goals was to use traditional 2D pointing devices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Collapsible Cylindrical Trees</head><p>To overcome the problems mentioned above we developed a new visualization and interaction technique for medium-sized hierarchies. The idea of CCT is not to visualize an entire tree hierarchy at once but only to display the first two levels of a tree plus the chosen path down the hierarchy. Thus information overload is avoided and a quick overview guaranteed. Local detail and global structure are satisfactorily balanced. This section introduces the underlying model and the CCT features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">The Model</head><p>Given a tree with a finite list of nodes, every node n has an associated set of attributes, which must contain a label and may contain an appropriate action, command, or URL. In addition to that, other attributes like color, size, or icon can be added depending on the semantics of the node. Every intermediate, i.e. parent node p has a set of children C. Let d be the depth of the tree and l the level within the hierarchy, where l=0 denotes the root node, and l=1 the children of the root node etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Hyperbolic sitemap of the MMT group</head><p>For every p (except the root node) a cylinder is constructed, on whose surface all nodes of C are displayed with their label on facets. The number of cylinder facets num f is fixed to a certain value, e.g. num f = 20. Facets are evenly spaced covering the whole cylinder, so with num f = 20 every facet covers 18° of the cylinder's surface. Facets are independent 3D objects, providing a basic color, text label, and icons for other node attributes. Each node of C is associated with a facet. If the number of children is smaller than num f , unnecessary facets are removed. For usability reasons and as opposed to cone trees the child facets are not evenly distributed around the circular base. If the number of children exceeds num f , all num f facets are used. The remaining nodes of C can be mapped to facets on the fly as needed (see section 3.2).</p><p>The basic idea of CCT is a set of nested cylinders according to the telescope metaphor. That means, for every node p listed on a cylinder with level l=i a new cylinder is constructed for C of p, which has a smaller radius and belongs to the level l=i+1. All smaller cylinders of level l=i+1 are nested and hidden within the l=i cylinder and can be pulled out to the right of the parent cylinder or collapsed as necessary. That means, only one path of the hierarchy is visible at once, represented by a number of ever decreasing cylinders showing all siblings of the corresponding level (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.  2</ref>). Therefore the basic layout is easy to comprehend with the x-axis representing tree depth, whereas siblings of C are displayed along the y-axis.</p><p>The second idea is the parallel display of all cylinders for l=1 in a horizontal fashion like being put on a stick. This increases usage of screen space. As soon as one of the l ≥ 1 cylinders is pulled out by the user, it would interfere with its right sibling cylinder. That is why all other cylinders except the expanded cylinder and its parent cylinders are squeezed or horizontally scaled to accommodate the same screen space as before. The cylinder width of the current path is accumulated and subtracted from the available screen width. The result is divided by the number of all remaining l=1 cylinders to calculate the new scale and translation values for them. Since cylinders of the current path are displayed with their normal width, they provide the desired details. All other scaled cylinders provide context, at the same time being accessible for further navigation. If the maximum compression of the sibling cylinders of l=1 is reached as a result of deep hierarchies, the cylinders of the current path can be collapsed too, starting from the left side (the oldest parent). As soon as the user ascends the hierarchy, the cylinders are stretched again.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Navigation and Interaction</head><p>As already mentioned, besides tree visualization the basic goal of CCT is performing an action associated to a node. This can be opening a file, executing a program, displaying a web page etc. This is done with a simple click of the mouse on the facet representing the node.</p><p>Due to the cylindrical mapping of nodes not all items may be visible at once. Therefore the rotation of cylinders is one of the possibilities for navigation. For that purpose the mouse is vertically moved in the upper or lower area of the cylinder, which causes its automatic rotation in the desired direction, thereby revealing the hidden nodes. Rotation speed increases at the edges of the cylinder to allow quick navigation while maintaining fine control in the central area.</p><p>If the number of children exceeds num f on the cylinder, the nodes in the back can be dynamically exchanged before becoming visible to the user. There could be a theoretically unlimited number of children on a cylinder. We call the concept endless cylinder. It is an improvement to the layouts of cone trees or spiral trees, where the visualized trees can be viewed from different directions. This inherently limits the possible arrangements of nodes. Since with CCT the user's viewpoint is fixed and cannot be changed, we can apply the "magic" on the backside of the cylinders.</p><p>The second navigation technique is needed to go down or up the hierarchy. Branch node facets provide this tree expansion functionality. Again, no mouse click is needed. If the mouse cursor stops in the center of a cylinder on top of a p node, the corresponding cylinder containing all nodes of C becomes visible and is translated to the right. All other l=1 cylinders are scaled to maintain the overall size. To investigate the nodes which just appear, the user only moves the mouse to the right and continues navigation on the sub-cylinder. If the mouse cursor is moved on any other cylinder, the cylinders are again collapsed in an animated way. All movements are smoothly animated.</p><p>The CCT navigation needs only a single click of the mouse when the desired node is reached. It is the click on a node facet to perform the associated action (see an example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>). Every single node of a hierarchy can be reached with only short vertical and horizontal mouse movements and without pressing any button. Vertical movements are reduced due to the cylindrical mapping. Horizontal movements are shortened due to the automatic movement of the current cylinder to the left side, whereas static menu systems require movements covering the whole menu width. Studies such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> report, that axis-aligned movements out-perform "off axis" movements especially when using the mouse for menu selection. The CCT navigation technique is also fast due to the equal size of all facets and the same width of all non-scaled cylinders, which is calculated according to the available space. Therefore the user maintains a simple mental model, memorizes mouse movements and thus employs muscle memory for navigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Size</head><p>After having introduced the main characteristics of CCT, we will explain what is meant with medium-sized trees. Due to the idea of presenting all l=1 cylinders in parallel, the number of root children num rc is limited. For the sake of text readability it should not exceed approximately 7 nodes, depending on the desired text length. This value is derived from the assumption of an average text label length and typical screen width of 1024 pixel. Due to the endless cylinder concept every intermediate node p can have a theoretically unlimited number of children num c . That means, all p nodes can have a high branching degree. However, if num c ≤ num f , the implementation becomes easier and the display will be more comprehensible. The tree depth is also unlimited, although useful values are again suggested by the number of cylinders being displayed in parallel. We therefore recommend a value of d = num rc -1 = 6. To summarize, except the top hierarchy CCT clearly encourage breadth instead of depth in displayed trees. Research on menu performance suggested, that breadth should be preferred over depth <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>If you consider the recommended d and num rc as well as num c ≤ num f , the maximum number of nodes in a tree would be calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">maxnum = num rc • num f d</formula><p>Given the recommended values num rc =7, d=6, and num f = 20 we get a theoretical maximum of 7•20 6 = 4.48 •10 8 nodes. The practical values are far lower, considering the balance of the tree and the fact, that leaf nodes not only occur at l=d, i.e. not every node within the hierarchy is a parent node. Practical values of a few hundreds to thousand nodes are typical for medium-sized hierarchies being displayable with the CCT technique. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Presentation Aspects</head><p>This section describes the basic visual parts of the three-dimensional visualization and its degrees of design freedom. All root children are assigned to a facet or plate above the corresponding cylinders. They have the same parts as the normal node facets on the cylinder, but are completely independent in terms of geometry and appearance. All cylinders consist of a body and the facets displayed on its surface. For the sake of a clear design and comprehensible visualization all cylinder and facet geometry is laid out identically (apart from the visual distortion in the scaled state). Facets are vertically centered on the cylinders. If their number exceeds num f ⁄2, the first facet is aligned near the top of a cylinder. A facet consists of a 3D text, a parent node indicator (e.g. a triangle like in typical menus), and a preview picture or item to the left of the text entry. This can be a thumbnail of the document being represented by the node, a node type indicator, a picture of a product, a visual icon for file size, ownership etc. For the text we recommend a condensed font such as Arial Narrow. According to the attributes of every single node the text label, facet color, and preview picture are changed. Various meanings can be coded with facet color. In the sitemap example of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref> every node has the color of the main category. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref> the color of node facets alternates facilitating a faster overview. Color can also indicate accessibility of a link, ownership, frequency of visits, document type etc. That means, although nodes are treated equally in terms of geometric layout, semantics can be conveyed in a variety of forms (form and color of the item segment; color, font type, and size of the text; display of icons or pictures).</p><p>As far as the cylinders are concerned, their radius, width, and appearance can be altered. Changing the radius, more or less facets can be displayed on the cylinder. One can for example adjust the number of facets to the perceptional favorable number of 4-8 items <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Through the perspective distortion at the edge of the cylinders one can still notice more items. The width of the cylinder determines the text length of the node labels. It must be balanced with the radius and number of l=1 cylinders to achieve an aesthetically pleasing and usable visualization. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref> shows a detail of the CCT sitemap with changed design parameters.</p><p>Current tree depth is visualized with the help of slightly scaled child cylinders. This value can be adjusted as well. Moreover, geometry and color of the child cylinders can indicate their relationship to the parent. The current position within the hierarchy is shown by a highlight of the active facet, which remains visible while the child cylinder is expanded. Unobtrusive sound can enhance the feeling of elegant interaction with the tree. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Application Examples</head><p>The CCT visualization and navigation technique is well suited for structured hierarchical information like taxonomies, family trees, web sitemaps, organizational charts, product hierarchies, media collections etc. It probably does not support very large hierarchies like complex file systems or huge 3D scene graphs. CCT are not made for discovering structures and relations in hierarchies, but were especially developed for fast navigation and visual comprehension of the visual structure.</p><p>The first idea for CCT is rooted in the development of a World Wide Web sitemap of our research group. A result is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2 and 3, containing 6</ref> top-level hierarchies. The tree contains approximately 300 nodes and still allows smooth navigation. Compared to the hyperbolic visualization depicted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, it allows a reproducible navigation and the visual structure remains the same. The small icons depict previews of people, project logos, or symbols like the sun for the summer semester or the PDF icon for respective documents. The corresponding web pages are opened in a separate window.</p><p>As a second example we implemented a content navigation, as one can find for online manuals, tutorials, specifications etc. We used existing content from a study on internet radio and developed a solution, where the CCT navigation is displayed in the top frame and the selected chapters in the content frame below it (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig.  5</ref>). The current path is always visible through the highlighted facets. The design is rather functional, without pictures, and resembles typical tables of contents. With this solution we tried to optimize the usage of available screen space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Analysis</head><p>The two realized prototypes were not formally evaluated yet. However, early informal evaluation experiences show the suitability of this approach for quick navigation and interaction in medium-sized hierarchies. Moreover, most of the test persons thought that they were fun to use. Due to the resemblance with traditional menu systems, even users with no particular 3D or visualization experiences reported, that they found CCT comprehensible. It seems reasonable to assume that almost no training is needed as opposed to other 3D tree visualization techniques. The fixed viewpoint, avoided information overload, short axis-aligned mouse movements, usage of muscle memory, and at most one necessary mouse click are reasons for that assumption.</p><p>CCT provide a compact and clearly arranged display of the first tree levels for a quick overview. Compared to menu systems, more information is displayed at once and cylinders can contain more items than traditional menus. Compared to cone trees and similar techniques, less information is displayed at the same time. We achieved a balance through providing enough details whilst not burdening the user with too much information, thus reducing the information load. Though 3D is visually exciting, the perspective and texture mappings degrade font quality, which is often a key aspect of information visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. With CCT both textures and text labels are always facing the user, which guarantees maximum display quality and readability. This is only reduced by current 3D browser limitations as far as text display quality is concerned.</p><p>The most noticeable disadvantages of CCT are the restricted number of root children and the limited display of hierarchies, i.e. only the current navigation path is visible besides the two topmost levels. We compensated for that with quick and elegant navigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Possible Enhancements</head><p>Looking at the content navigation example, screen space is efficiently used. If the full screen area is available like for a sitemap, an improvement would be the display of several cylinder bars in a vertical fashion like in a matrix. For every child p of the root node one row of cylinders could be constructed (level 1), where each cylinder is one of the children of p (level 2) and contains the grandchildren on its facets (level 3). This enhancement allows viewing three tree levels at once, and still permits the navigation within the sub-levels.</p><p>Another technique to improve on the number of root children is a toroidal or donut arrangement of the toplevel cylinders instead of the linear display. The perspective distortion of the cylinders in the current implementation already hints at this idea.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Implementation</head><p>For the implementation of the sample CCT applications we used the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> as the current standard for 3D graphics on the web.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">VRML Representation</head><p>We defined three VRML prototypes for the CCT visualization. One contains the cylinder geometry together with invisible feedback areas in the upper and lower region of the cylinder. Touch sensors are associated with it and generate move_up and move_down events. The second PROTO contains the geometry of one single facet, the 3D text, the parent node indicator, and the textured face for the icon. All configurable attributes are defined as fields of the prototype, such as the color or text. The third prototype mainFacet is very similar to the facet PROTO; it contains the facet geometry and text for the root children (the plate above each cylinder).</p><p>The VRML file itself contains a transformation hierarchy with all cylinders and their parameterized facets, using the prototypes with the EXTERNPROTO statement. In addition to that, a number of TimeSensors, ROUTE-Statements and an external JavaScript were defined for event handling. The move_up and move_down events of a cylinder activate the TimeSensors, which in turn call the corresponding functions of the script to rotate the cylinders.</p><p>Every facet has an associated sensor, which calls a script function that activates a timer to expand or collapse the corresponding sub-cylinder. At the same time all other cylinders receive events to adjust themselves and their sub-cylinders. After expanding or collapsing a cylinder its width is distributed to the parent, which calculates the width of all sibling cylinders. They in turn calculate the new positions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Internal Tree Representation</head><p>It would be extremely difficult to develop the VRML representation manually. That is why we decoupled the tree structure and the 3D representation and automatically generate the VRML files from the internal representation of any hierarchy. A simple XML <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> grammar was created to code the trees: </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">&lt;!ELEMENT NODE (NODE*)&gt; &lt;!ATTLIST</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">CCT Architecture</head><p>The CCT architecture is depicted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. At present we use a Java program to convert the XML document to the VRML file. Using the Document Object Model (DOM) the tree file is parsed and converted into an internal node hierarchy. A converter class then generates the VRML file with the help of the PROTOs and automatically creates the TimeSensors and ROUTE-Statements. After that the VRML file can be displayed in a web browser using a common VRML plug-in.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 6. The CCT architecture: current and future implementation at the top and bottom</head><p>The successor of VRML97 will be X3D (Extensible 3D) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Besides other improvements it provides an XML encoding for VRML. Therefore the more elegant solution would be to transform the XML tree file into an X3D representation with the help of the Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The XSL Transformations Language (XSLT) allows the direct transformation of the XML document into the X3D file as shown in the lower part of <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. The second solution will be implemented as soon as stable X3D browsers will be available. At the moment the processing part is triggered manually after every change of the hierarchies, though it could be automated and realized on the fly with the help of a crawler process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Performance</head><p>Due to the impressive advances in 3D graphics hardware and software the display of the sample trees with about 300 nodes is easy-to-use with an acceptable frame rate on a 750 MHz PC with a mid-range graphics accelerator. For an average hierarchy of 200 nodes approximately 40 cones, 200 facets, and more than 1000 VRML routes are being created. So the routes and the event handling are rather the bottleneck of this implementation. An advantage of the CCT approach is, that most of the cylinders can be hidden within their parent cylinders. This way they do not need to be drawn at all. At most num rc + d−1 cylinders and num rc + (num rc + d−1)•num f facets must be displayed at once. If many preview pictures or icons are displayed, the performance slows down depending on the available texture memory and 3D graphics capabilities of the systems. A high-end graphics PC smoothly displays a fully textured hierarchy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We introduced a new visualization and interaction technique for medium-sized trees. Collapsible Cylindrical Trees allow an overview about the first two levels of a hierarchy plus the display of a navigation path within the tree. Thus the visualization balances detail and context through dynamically expanding and collapsing sub-hierarchies, represented by cylinders with facets for every child. We implemented a fast navigation technique, where only one click is needed to reach every single node and perform an action on it. The solution is suitable for being used on the web and allows aesthetically pleasing tree visualizations. Our sample applications show, that CCT and interaction with it are easy to comprehend.</p><p>The implementation must be refined and improved, since it is only a proof of concept yet. A formal evaluation and usability tests are a necessary continuation of our work. CCT performance could be measured in comparison to traditional menu systems or to other three-dimensional web navigation techniques. It will be interesting to find out, how CCT behave with more complex hierarchies and to implement the suggested enhancements.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>A web sitemap of the MMT group using the CCT visualization with current depth of 3.</figDesc></figure>
