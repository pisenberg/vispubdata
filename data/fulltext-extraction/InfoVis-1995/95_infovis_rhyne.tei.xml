<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction:</head><p>TheUnitedStatesEnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) has recently begun to examine how to provide scientific visualization capabilities to environmental scientists, policy analysts and decision makers with personal computers (PCs) running either Microsoft DOS or Windows. Here, we outline an approach for using the WWW as a tool for disseminating knowledge on scientific visualization and for intelligent access to visualization capabilities on high performance (UNIX) workstations.</p><p>In general, scientific visualization software is a niche market primarily based in theUNIX workstation arena. Usage of the software requires an understanding of computer graphics techniques which the general user in the EPA community might not have. In order for PC desktop visualization to succeed, the software tools for visual display and Internet connectivity need to be in the token-ring Local Area Network (LAN) and PC microcomputer arenas.</p><p>The typical desktop computer used within the EPA community is a 386 machine running Microsoft Windows. The majority of these PCs are not hardware configured to support interactive scientific visualization. The economic constraints associated with agency wide computer graphics hardware and software upgrades force the obvious solution of installing PC-based scientific visualization software to be very difficult to implement. There are also existing agency wide LAN standards which the PC-based visualization software would need to be customized to accommodate.</p><p>For this reason, we consider, here, refocusing the PC desktop visualization software issue into a World Wide gional offices and state environmental protection offices via the Internet, WWW browsing tools have been successfully evaluated on EPA agency LAN configurations and are already available and supported by the agency.</p><p>These tools, however, do not support the interactive visual display of technical or scientific data. For this reason, wedistinquishbetween scientific visualization where the user can interact with the data and information visualization where the user can obtain only pictorial displays. A U.S.EPAScientificVisuaIizationCenterWWWbased application is under development and testing within the EPA telecommunications infrastructure. This application includes: a) computer based instruction on applying scientific visualization techniques to EPA data sets; b) procedures and utilities for converting data sets into formats readable by scientific visualization software; c) guidelines for preparing animations to be recorded onto videotape; d) a listing of hardware platforms and software tools for doing real time scientific visualization and desktop videoconferencing; e) tools for integrating visualizations with geographic information systems and database environments and I) other information pertaining to visualizing environmental sciences data sets.</p><p>Design elements of this WWW application include touch sensitive maps of the North American continent. These maps reference environmental data according to U.S. regional, state and local groupings to support decision query activities. Multiple formats for the display of environmental data are under design. These include: a) agency standard tables and charts for emission data; b) statistical plotting capabilities; c) two-dimensional graphical displays registered against geographical elements like waterways and roadways; and d) three-dimensional scientific visualizations and animations. (http: //www.epa.gov/nep/index.html) Special Considerations: /</p><p>When examining the transfer of scientific visualization methodologies into the information visualization arena, it is important to remember the viewpoint of general users. Most users accessing information over the Internet are browsing and become impatient waiting for detailed graphics to appear on their computer screens. So images that are kept small, like postage stamp icons, are often the desired objective for designing WWW pages.</p><p>PC-based workstations, with no specializedgraphic hardware, will not display volume renderings, transparency, detailed color maps, and advanced three-dimensional computer graphics techniques with the same clarity as UNIXbased graphics (e.g. Silicon Graphics) workstations. Frequently, WWW based still image graphics are displayed in GIF formats and not necessarily the file format originally used for image generation (or rendering). For animation, time series displays initially rendered on high-end UNIX workstations often need to be converted and compressed into formats like JPEG and MPEG for PC-based display. These WWW based graphics and animations might not be tightly coupled to the computational or processed data used for scientific visualization image creation. This poses challenges in checking data integrity and validity by scientists, policy analysts, and decision makers on PC-based architectures.</p><p>Current technology assessment efforts at the U.S. EPA involve testing public domain PC-based MPEG readers that display environmental sciences animation sequences. This assessment includes formulating guidelines for creating visualization sequences on high end (UNIX) workstations that will be effectively displayed onPC-based architectures. Techniques for linking WWW applications to large environmental sciences databases, geographic information systems, and computational models are also under evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Navigating and Connecting Information Visualization:</head><p>A significant limitation of existing hypermedia Internet tools, like Mosaic, is the inability to rapidly find and quickly recall information resources of interest on the WWW. Infrequent (and general) users of distributed hypermedia systems can easily become overwhelmed by the large num-ber of links to information resources and disoriented while navigating between the various remote file servers. One potential solution to this dilemma is the incorporation of intelligent or remote agent capabilities into browser programs. ( 0 An agent is an automated program that examines the Internet on its operator's behalf searching for specified information. There are currently a few agents already existing which are called "web crawlers". Using keyword-based searches, web crawlers automatically search through the Internet and index the information they find.</p><p>In the scientific visualization arena, a number of research groups have begun to explore building intelligence into visualization software. (2, 3) Initial evaluation and testing of these kinds of tools has begun at the U.S. EPA Scientific Visualization Center. With these concepts, an environmental researcher or policy analyst can prescribe a particular analysis task such as compare ozone concentrations with power plant emissions for a given air pollution computational model scenario. The software system then automatically creates an appropriate visualization. The users of these task-directed or rule based visualization software systems specify their area of interest, describe the dam parameters, and determine an analysis objective. The intelligent software tool will then suggest and describe visual representations of the data which might include contour plots, isosurfaces, volume renderings, and animated vector representations.</p><p>Some of these prototype systems have explored developing WWW applications which provide an on-line catalog of visualization techniques. (2) This allows novice and advanced users to become familiar with computer generated graphics techniques and to understand the capabilities of intelligent visualization software. The linking of WWW agent capabilities with rule-based visualization techniques has the potential to enhance information visualization and decision support activities. At EPA, these intelligent visualization and browsing tools are intended to enhance already existing efforts to build expert systems for environmental assessment and policy analysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> Examining the Spatial and Geographic Browsing Problem:</p><p>Many components of environmental information visualization are geographically referenced. For comprehensive interpretation of geographically referenced information and its associated dam, there is a need for browser programs (e.g. Mosaic) to be integrated with remotely distributed and networked spatial data bases (e.g. Geographic Information Systems), computational modeling programs, and scientific visualization tools. On PC-based amhitectures, access to many of these met&amp;computing resources is feasible but real time interaction and graphical display might not be possible.</p><p>The U.S. EPA has begun to develop approaches for using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) servers for the batch processing of custom map and data requests in the WWW environment. (5) The WWW acts as the user interface for submitting requests for creating information reports and cutomized maps to a GIS server on the Internet. These requests can thus be initiated from PCs as well as any other type of workstation which has access to the WWW environment. (http://www.epa.gov/regionlO/www//siteinfo.html)</p><p>A few research teams are exploring building interface agents for browser programs which will be able to examine non-textural data like digital maps, photographs, and computer generated imagery. (6) For environmental information, the basic concept is to augment browser programs with an intelligent "interface" agent that can learn particular requirements and needs of environmental science, policy analysis and decision making. On PC architectures, the intelligent or mobile agent function is used to track the execution of computational model programs, determine the size and display requirements for large spatial data sets, perform file conversion functions to support the graphical display of computer generated images, and determine appropriate visualizations of the data. <ref type="formula">7</ref>The incorporation of intelligent agents into browser programs provides the opportunity for the development of comprehensive integrated environmental decision support systems for scientists, educators and the general public which accommodate navigating through the maze of me&amp;computing resources. Some commercial Internet browsing tools begin to address these issues. (8)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and Recommendations:</head><p>Effective transfer of scientific visualization techniques to the PC-based desktop involves refocusing the desktop visualization software issue into a WWW information visualization scenario. This redefinition allows for PC based information visualization and collaboration between remotely located sites via the Internet. The wide usage and technical support of Internet browsing tools, like Mosaic, on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh platforms allows for implementation of the information visualization scenario for researchers, policy analysts, decision makers and the general public.</p><p>AU.S.EPAScientificVisualizationCenterWWWbased application is under development and testing within the EPA telecommunications infrastructure. This tool educates and prepares novice and advanced users in the application of scientific visualization techniques to environmental sciences data sets. This first step will allow researchers, policy analysts, and decision makers with PC architectures to become familiar with three dimensional visual representations of data. The future development of intelligent agents that are incorporated into Internet browsing tools and scientific visualization software will aid in the building of comprehensive environmental sciences decision support systems. These task directed decision support systems will allow environmental researchers and policy analysts to specify analysis requirements. The system will then automatically construct appropriate visualizations which are linked to geographic information databases.</p></div>			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot">O-8186-7201-3/95 $04.00 0 1995 IEEE</note>
