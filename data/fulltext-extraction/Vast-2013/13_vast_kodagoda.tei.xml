			<abstract>
				<p>This research aims to develop design guidelines for systems that support investigators and analysts in the exploration and assembly of evidence and inferences. We focus here on the problem of identifying candidate ʻinfluencersʼ within a community of practice. To better understand this problem and its related cognitive and interaction needs, we conducted a user study using a system called INVISQUE (INteractive Visual Search and QUery Environment) loaded with content from the ACM Digital Library. INVISQUE supports search and manipulation of results over a freeform infinite ʻcanvasʼ. The study focuses on the representations user create and their reasoning process. It also draws on some pre-established theories and frameworks related to sense-making and cognitive work in general, which we apply as a ʻtheoretical lensesʼ to consider findings and articulate solutions. Analysing the user-study data in the light of these provides some understanding of how the high-level problem of identifying key players within a domain can translate into lower-level questions and interactions. This, in turn, has informed our understanding of representation and functionality needs at a level of description which abstracts away from the specifics of the problem at hand to the class of problems of interest. We consider the study outcomes from the perspective of implications for design.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The way in which people reason about complex sense-making problems is frequently tacit. We may have few insights about the underlying cognitive processes and how these relate to the manipulation and generation of information artefacts. Theoretical models, such as Klein at al's Data Frame Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and Pirolli and Card's model of intelligence analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, have attempted to articulate these processes, but we still do not fully understand how applications should be designed such that they support data analysts as they proceed through the sense-making activities, from foraging to hypothesis creation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>In particular, there are questions about how the visual supports in a computer user interface should be designed such that they are compatible with the way in which investigators or analysts reason, and how they might assemble data for reflection as part of constructing their conclusions or claims. We hope to uncover the process of sense-making such that we might be able to explain and identify implications for design which support users in developing initial or tentative guesses and maturing these into more robust and defensible arguments.</p><p>We report a user study conducted using a non-traditional GUI (graphical user interface) called INVISQUE (INteractive VIsual Search and QUery Environment) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. A group of librarians were asked to identify candidate 'influencers' within an academic community. We observed and recorded them as they carried out the task. At the end of the task, we used a set of probe questions designed to elicit accounts of their actions and the reasoning that occurred during the task.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is laid out as follows: In sections 1 to 4 we describe the theory of sense-making (particularly Klein's Data-Frame Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>), and give an overview of sense-making and reasoning systems. In section 5 we describe the INVISQUE system and in section 6 we describe the user-study and report our findings in section 7. In section 8 we discuss the results and implications for design, concluding in section 9. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">SENSE-MAKING MODELS</head><p>In this section we give a brief overview of Klein et al's Data-Frame Model of sense-making (DFM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Pirolli and Card's</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> model of intelligence analysis. We explain the significance of the DFM for the current study and the implications the model has for the design of visual analysis systems to assist in making sense of large volumes of data.</p><p>The DFM distinguishes two kinds of entity: data and frames; these interact symbiotically during sense-making. Data are aspects of the world that a sensemaker experiences as they interact with it. They might include things that the sensemaker sees or hears, which provide information about the aspects of a prevailing situation. A frame is a representation, which, in the mind of the sensemaker, offers an account or hypothesis of that situation. Klein et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> refer to a frame as a mental construct that positions our knowledge in relation to the new data we receive and are starting to understand. A frame is a way of organising our understanding of the new data in relation to what we already know. This new organisation represents a new understanding, and when this new understanding is something significant or meaningful, it represents the moment of insight -this unique organisation of knowledge and information places the full set of cues in a unique explanatory perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>The DFM of sense-making describes the process of fitting data to a frame and a frame around data while testing and improving the frame. The model comprises four main sense-making processes (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.): Connecting data to frame (shown in the upper-most rectangle) is said to occur when some data is understood within the context of a frame, an initial and possibly tentative understanding of data representing a given situation; Elaborating the frame is the process of searching for more data that might extend one's understanding of the situation. As one understands the situation better, one is able to ask more questions about it. Importantly, it is the frame which defines what counts as data; Questioning the frame is said to occur when one asks questions about the validity or the assumptions made about one's current understanding or frame; and re-framing occurs when one realises that one has misunderstood what the data really means and one needs a better understanding. Beyond these core processes, others are incorporated, including preserving the frame (explaining away inconsistencies), comparing frames (finding the best of a number of choices) and seeking the frame (explicitly searching for a new frame).  <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, Data-frame model of sense-making (courtesy of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>).</p><p>Pirolli and Card <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> offer a model of intelligence analysis which shows the transformations that an analyst performs in the process of converting multiple data sources into novel information. At the highest level, the model divides into two main loops: a foraging loop is associated with searching, filtering and organising information into some schema. A sense-making loop focuses on building a mental model from the schema to support, question, as a way of constructing a story.</p><p>This model of intelligence analysis has been frequently cited, and is useful in describing the stages by which data and analysts' observations are processed and eventually transposed into 'hypotheses' to generate suitable answers. In informal interactions with intelligence staff we found that the Pirolli and Card model is frequently regarded as a recognisable account of what they do.</p><p>However, for the purposes of this study we turn more to Klein et al's DFM as our theoretical framework. We have an interest in relating interface actions to underlying, cognitive sense-making processes, or rather, understanding user interactions as a product of broader sense-making actions. The DFM provides a relatively rich account of sense-making cognition. It is also agonistic with respect to information behaviour. This we found convenient since information behaviour is shaped by tools and environment and we wanted to observe how these would be appropriated in support of sense-making without prior assumptions. Having said this, we used the DFM as a lightweight theoretical frame such that we could adopt both deductive (top-down) and inductive (bottom-up) approaches in our analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Our intention was to leverage concepts within the DFM where appropriate, but to not be over-constrained by it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">VISUAL SUPPORTS FOR SENSE-MAKING: UNDERSTANDING WHAT TO REPRESENT</head><p>Visualization representations communicate meaning. However, what is meant is frequently less than obvious, and some degree of explanation is required before an intended meaning is understood. How do we help a viewer see and understand what the data contains? How do we help the viewer connect with the data, or be aware that there is more they need to elaborate? Or be conscious that, perhaps, something does not look right and so to question what he/she is seeing? Or be brought to the realisation that somehow their assumptions have been wrong and therefore they should re-consider their conclusions, and reframe their perspective and understanding of the data? We believe these four aspects of Klein et al.'s DFM can guide our thinking on how we design visual supports for representing the sense-making process.</p><p>Knowing what to visually represent at the user interface can be usefully informed by the Law of Requisite Variety <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. According to this principle, a control (or in this case, representational) system should have the capabilities to cater for the variety of situations that the system under control will face. Failure to comply with this law in causal systems such as a nuclear power plant, have led to the problem of 'brittle systems'. Such systems can fail to cope when situations that fall outside of the conditions that they were planned to cope with. Unlike process control systems that are governed by the laws of nature, the systems used by intelligence and investigative analysts, are governed by the principles of logic and human analytical reasoning.</p><p>There have been significant amounts of work to understand the structures that underlie the information of interest to analysts, and how these structures manifest themselves. However, there has been less research on how we might visually represent the 'thinking processes' such that we can then trace reasoning and analysis through the thinking space.</p><p>Borrowing concepts of causal reasoning, the DFM, and the elements of Critical Thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, can enable us to identify the structural relationships in data from a cognitive functional perspective, and will guide us how to do representation.</p><p>From the literature on Causal Reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, there are three basic elements that are relevant to determining what can be used to structure and provide supports or scaffolds: Propensity, Mutability, and Co-variance. From Klein et al's. DFM, we see the need to connect with the data, to elaborate, question, and reframe. Finally, from the Critical Thinking approach, the need for identifying structures that support thinking is explored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">TACTILE REASONING</head><p>Direct manipulation of information objects (tactile reasoning) in a graphical user interface (GUI) supports analytical reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Tactile Reasoning requires a direct manipulation system and requires spatial representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. However, the GUI must also support a certain degree of freedom for the user to reason through the manipulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The perceived benefit of tactile reasoning is that when people can freely manipulate data it has the potential to enhance their sense-making and analytical reasoning ability by helping them explore and discover new explanatory relationships created by rearranging pieces of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Takken and Wong conducted a card based study in which they hypothesised that physical manipulation (or rearranging) of information would enhance participants sense-making and analytical reasoning ability by helping them to discover new explanatory relationships. Their results were consistent with and built upon the work of Kirsh and Maglio <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> who defined the type of data manipulation activities, that lead to uncovering information that is hidden or hard to compute mentally, as epistemic actions. Tactile reasoning is a form of epistemic action that is hypothesised to reveal hidden or hard to compute patterns as the data is manipulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Maglio also observed tactile reasoning to help reveal hidden and hard to find patterns while conducting a study using scrabble tiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. They used tiles from a game of Scrabble to see if epistemic actions aid in the discovery of anagram solutions within two different sets of seven tiles. The results showed that on a set of letters with low word frequency, i.e. a set of letters that could be used to form fewer words and more uncommon words, the ability to manipulate the tiles freely yielded more words than when no manipulation is allowed <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Tactile reasoning can be seen as a form of distributed cognition where the cognitive processes are distributed to the physical representations of the relevant information, their arrangement and the interaction with the representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">REASONING SYSTEMS</head><p>There are a number of interactive visual reasoning tools that aim to help users make sense of data. IBM's i2 Analysts Notebook provides data storage, analysis, visualization, and dissemination capabilities that support the ability to discover networks, patterns and trends across large volumes of structured and unstructured data in order to identify, predict, prevent, and disrupt criminal, terrorist, and fraudulent activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Jigsaw <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> provides multiple coordinated views of documents and entities in a way that visually displays connections between entities across different documents. Inspired by Jigsaw, Czsaw provides an editable and re-playable history navigation channel in addition to the Jigsaw-like multiple visual representations of document collections and the entities within them <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>ForceSPIRE proposes the semantic interaction as a design space for user interaction to combine the massive data foraging abilities of statistical models and data mining algorithms. Sense-making is supported through a visual medium, so as to non-intrusively capture the semantic knowledge or intent of the user to guide the system and support the entire analytic process <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Another visual sensemaking tool is Wright et al.'s Sandbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, which is designed to support visual thinking by combining human insight with computational linguistic and analytical functions.</p><p>Sense-making is not always achieved from structured activities alone. Serendipity can often lead to spontaneous discovery and ultimately to insight. Interactive visual discovery tools such the Bohemian Bookshelf are designed to, "support such serendipitous discovery by: a) offering multiple visual access points to the collection; b) highlighting adjacencies between books; c) providing flexible visual pathways for exploring the collection; d) enticing curiosity through abstract, metaphorical, and visually distinct representations of books; and e) enabling a playful approach to information exploration." <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Exploration through the act of "strolling" through paths in the quest for serendipitous discovery is encouraged by PivotPaths, which exposes faceted relations as visual paths through an information space <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Sense-making can also be a collaborative process. The table-top visual analytics tool Cambiera is one example of a tool which was developed to support manipulation techniques that allow users to construct individual hypothesis while maintaining awareness through the shared space <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>In the realm of high-resolution displays (but not necessarily collaboration) resides the tool of Analytics Workspace <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, which is designed to take advantage of space as part of distributed cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> for sense-making purposes.</p><p>Bederson et al.'s Pad++ introduces the concept of smooth zooming for navigation to support interaction with large datasets for multimedia authoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. While Shipman and Marshall <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> work on incremental formalization on spatial hypertext, enabling users to interact and incorporate information in an informal or semi-formal representation, thus facilitating the evolution of the information space into formalised representations. Wittenburg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> introduced an interactive, multidimensional visualization a system known as EZChooser, used for dynamic querying.</p><p>One of the problems associated with exploring information is the phenomenon of "what was I looking for" (WWILF), where the user gets lost within the system and data. GraphicTrails is a tool which seeks to address this by integrating exploratory visualizations with rich exploration histories <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. GraphicTrails uses multiple views that include tag clouds, matrices, tables, and a hybrid bar chart as aggregate overviews of the large dataset while introducing the new concept of "pivoting" as a transition between aggregates <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">INVISQUE</head><p>For the purpose of this study, we asked participants to use INVISQUE to assist in identifying candidate influencers with an academic community. INVISQUE, which stands for INteractive VIsual Search and QUery Environment, supports search and manipulation of results over a freeform infinite 'canvas' (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  1</ref>). Searches are submitted on the canvas, and results presented as sets of index cards (the metaphor is of library index cards). These are laid out horizontally and vertically according to user-selectable metadata (e.g. year of publication, citation count, author, keyword) (see <ref type="figure">Figures 5a and 5b</ref>). This provides visual cues in the form of the height and the placement of the index cards based on Gestalt principles of perception and pre-attentive vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The query appears as a title above the set.</p><p>When search results are returned, the first six documents are displayed as cards. An overview of the complete set is shown on a contextual interval slider bar above the card set (see <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). This displays documents as points on a scatter plot using the same X and Y dimensions as the card display. An adjustable 'window' overlay can be used to adjust where in the set the card display begins and ends <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Whilst the scatter plot gives context to the result set, the index cards provide detail <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Multiple searches can be performed and the results can be simultaneously laid out on the canvas, with search clusters minimised or closed to reduce clutter on the canvas.</p><p>Each card corresponds with an information object (e.g. document) and shows its metadata (e.g. title, author, keywords and part of the abstract). Clicking an icon at the top right of a card reveals the information object as an overlay. When selecting an item of metadata on a card, the system visually highlights all cards on the canvas that share the same value (see <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>), taking advantage of pre-attentive vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>The user can move cards around the canvas as sets, or pull out individual cards. We describe this as tactile reasoning since it allows users to create new bespoke sets that are given a user-defined title. Bespoke card sets can also be arranged automatically using metadata. The user is able to zoom in to an area of interest or zoom out to gain context. Card sets can be combined using Boolean operations by dragging and dropping one onto another (AND/OR) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7a</ref>) or grabbing a facet and shaking it (as if to say 'no') (NOT). These interactions are intended to support incremental formalisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, thus allowing the user to explore and increasingly make sense of the data over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">USER EVALUATION</head><p>We used INVISQUE to study a group of users solving a problem in which they were asked to identifying three key 'influencers' from amongst a community of practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1">Participants</head><p>Six senior university librarians were recruited as participants. We were interested in observing how users with high information literacy would use the system to make sense of an unfamiliar domain. There were three females and three males with an average age of 43 years. None of the participants had used INVISQUE previously, although all the participants were competent using computers and library database systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2">Procedure</head><p>INVISQUE was loaded with metadata from the ACM SIGCHI conference from 1982 to 2011 -around 9000 records in all. The metadata was connected back to the ACM digital library via Middlesex University Athens allowing access to the full text of publications. We were interested in observing how users who were trained in systematic searching and analysis would use the system to make sense of an unfamiliar domain. The participants were provided with a computer with INVISQUE installed and some paper and pens for making additional notes if wanted.</p><p>After a short briefing video and some familiarisation time, the participants were asked to identify a minimum of three influential authors who they considered had made considerable contributions to the field of 'information visualization', and to explain their reasoning. They were given about an hour for the task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.3">Data collection</head><p>Multiple CTA methods were used <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> with the aim of elucidating sense-making cognition in relation to interactions with the system. These included think-aloud elicitation during the task with full resolution video capture of screens, combined with observations (video capture and field notes) and interaction logs. After each session, a semi-structured interview was conducted using SMART probes <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> based on the DFM. During the interviews, selected sections of the recorded video were played back to help participants recall and reflect on the interviewer questions. This was done to clarify observations made during the task and to address queries noted by the researcher during the think-aloud.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.4">Analysis</head><p>The think-aloud protocols, observations (field notes) were transcribed and combined with the video recordings. These and the post-task interviews based on SMART probes were analysed using thematic analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Accordingly, the steps taken for the analysis were:</p><p>Familiarisation with the data: The transcripts, videos and field notes were reviewed repeatedly with patterns and possible mappings between sense-making activity and interaction informally noted.</p><p>Coding: The dataset was comprehensively coded. Initially, a set of codes describing low-level information interactions were inductively generated and applied (e.g. hover mouse over author, attend to spatial location of index card). These were further annotated with explanatory goals interpreted in the light of the thinkaloud and interviews.</p><p>Identifying themes: Related information interactions were then collated and coded (interpreted) in terms of the DFM where this could appropriately be applied. Coding at this level was a hybrid of inductive/deductive (theoretically motivated) approaches. Where the DFM appeared to account for the data, codes relating to model processes were used (e.g. identify frame, elaborate frame, reframe). At this level, additional codes were generated to account for behaviour outside of the DFM. (Typically, these related to information seeking).</p><p>Reviewing themes: The themes were then revisited to determine whether they could be better named and to provide deeper meaning. As the data analysis process was highly interpretive, the findings were frequently discussed to establish agreement between multiple researchers, particularly where interpretation was difficult and equivocal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">FINDINGS</head><p>We saw the task as one of asking participants to map individuals to an abstracted schema or archetype (i.e. 'a leader in a field') based on information in the database. We took the instantiation of this archetype through data as linking data to frame. They did this by exploring data with a focus on features that the system made available, publication count, highly cited papers, recent publications, publication relevance to the topic of interest etc.</p><p>The analyses yielded four overarching activity themes which together constituted stages of the task -hence they provide the basis for a process model. These were: establishing a working set of relevant material, establishing candidates, exploring candidates, and comparing candidates. In the following we discuss each of the four stages in turn, linking them to sense-making steps that became apparent during each and corresponding interactions with the INVISQUE interface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Establishing a working set of topic relevant material</head><p>Establishing a working set involves identifying a subset of data (publications) relevant to the topic of interest. This was an emergent theme which was difficult to account for within the scope of the DFM model, which we note is not intended to capture the data gathering process. In this task, however, information search and retrieval played a crucial part. All participants performed a series of searches in order to establish an initial working set about 'information visualization'. This was the primary focus of activity at the outset of the task, although on-going refinements did occur. Participants querying strategies were apparently guided by a desired trade-off between optimising precision, recall and arriving at subset amenable to detailed exploration.</p><p>Participants P1, P3 &amp; P5 performed multiple searches which they laid out on the canvas. They then combined selected searches to improve recall (using Boolean OR) and precision (using Boolean AND). For example, while all participants searched for 'information visualization' (153 results), participants P1, P3 &amp; P5 searched for 'information' and 'visualization' separately and combined them (Boolean AND) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3)</ref>. The analysis suggested that if a broad query delivered a manageable set of results then they were likely to tolerate lower precision in the interests of higher recall.   Once an initial working set was established, further refinement and exploration was performed. Examples included viewing aggregated publications per author, considering relationships between co-authors, exploring relationships between the topic and subtopics, and investigating the relevance of individual publications to the topic. The system was not able to automatically offer these functions, so participants were often required to find workarounds. For example, Participants P2, P3, P4 &amp; P6 used the search functionality to better understand relationships between topics and sub-topics by initiating searches from card metadata in the interests of optimising recall (they did this in the absence of any index term taxonomy) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>). They ran searches on what seemed like subtopics and added the results into a working collection (AND). This was to improve on recall and to get a sense of the taxonomy. However, participants were unable to make sense of the associated sub-topics of 'information visualization'; the manual attempt to create an index-term taxonomy was cumbersome and associated with higher cost due to the large volume of data. Due to this, the attempt was abandoned.</p><p>The following quote from participant P6 is taken to show the setback encountered exploring subtopic relationships for within 'information visualization':</p><p>…I was trying to explore topics separately and see relevance to 'information visualization' but could not find anything useful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Establishing candidates (Connecting data to the frame)</head><p>By 'establishing candidates' we mean the process of making some commitment to a given author being an 'influencer'. We associate this move with the DFM's connecting data to a frame. We took this point as occurring when participants made a persistent change to the index card layout such that documents by a single author were set aside for further inspection (see next section). All of our participants considered multiple indicators to guide their selection of candidate 'influencers', with these arising through an iterative process of discovery. Participants might order the working set to show the most highly cited publications (see <ref type="figure">Figure  5)</ref>. Then, taking one index card at a time and starting with the publication with the most citations or most recent publication with high citations, highlight the author field to display all publications by that author on the scatter plot (see <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). Ordering the working set and selecting authors in this way effectively combined information about who had published the most highly cited papers with a sense of how many papers they had published. Participant P1 said: …there are two things, a) he was in the highest cited papers, so that gets me to think ok there is some credibility here, then I am seeing a reasonable amount of red dots to suggest that there is a reasonable track record of publication. So those two things indicate this someone is worth putting in the list.</p><p>The ability to order by citation and highlight selected authors in the scatterplot apparently allowed participants to perform low-cost exploration of hunches in a way that incurred minimal changes to the interface state.</p><p>Appropriating the system's ability to show documents ordered by citation as a means of surfacing potential 'influencers' also drew some participants' attention to the limitations of this. Participants P1, P2, P3 &amp; P5, for example, became aware that some 'influencers' may be indicated by more moderate citation rates over a larger number of papers. Manual exploration was the only way of discovering these, but given the higher cost of doing so, this was not done. Hence, whilst some system features were convenient for surfacing candidate 'influencers' with a particular kind of profile, participants were aware of a bias that this might create given the relative costs of exploring other types of profile.</p><p>On identifying a candidate 'influencer', participant dragged the author metadata to a new location on the canvas with the effect of initiating a new search for all documents by that author (independent of the information visualization topic) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref>-a).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Exploring candidates (Elaborating and Questioning the frame)</head><p>We use the term 'exploring candidates' to refer to the process of focussing on a subset of data relating to a given candidate (established during the previous process) for more detailed exploration and testing. In each case, we understood the subsets as corresponding to 'hunches' and working with them as associated with the DFM's elaborating and questioning the frame.</p><p>During candidate exploration there was some on-going filtering designed to improve the quality of the search results. For example, on observing that a new card set could contain publications by an author in areas other than 'information visualization' many participants performed a Boolean AND between that set and the original card on 'information visualization' to improve precision (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref>-b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The following quote from participant P1 illustrates this: …if I put Stuart Card as a separate search, then it is giving me all of Stuart Cards papers, it is not giving me the stuff on information visualization. I have to recombine [Boolean AND] Stuart Card and information visualization.</head><p>Preference was also observed for viewing the full dataset as index cards -achieved by increasing the interval slider width Participants also ordered the new collection by citation to get a sense of the citation distribution over time (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7-d)</ref>, and ordered by time to see over how many years they had been active years (duration).</p><p>During this phase many participants discovered new number of indicators that they could use for making 'influencer' assessments. These included considering the total number of publications, the publishing period, any gaps in publishing years, the citation distribution, and relevance of the publications to the topic of interest.</p><p>During the elaboration activity, some participants observed data that were inconsistent with an 'influencer' hunch, which raised surprise and resulted in them questioning the frame. Examples of this included observing fewer than expected publications with high citations, many publications with zero citations, a lack of recent publications, gaps in publication years (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7-c)</ref>, or seeing that a collection was not well related to the topic (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref>).</p><p>The following quote from participant P3 is an example of questioning the frame:</p><p>…you can observe that since 1996 to current the citation count has been going down. The 2009 paper has not been cited. But the 2009 is a workshop, so not sure if that is seriously significant. So he has not really published anything significant since 2001. So he is kind of on the wave. …the visualization kind of helps you see that. I am not sure if you see that in a conventional database.</p><p>Observing publications with zero citations also led to questioning and a desire for filtering publications that made less of a contribution to the 'influencer' judgement. Participants were unable to do sophisticated filtering using the system and so were forced to explore it manually. The manual exploration (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 9</ref>) and the influencers identified on the canvas (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>) had close relationships. Participants P1, P2, &amp; P5 introduced thresholds for manual filtering on some indicators (such as citation count). Sometimes thresholds became increasingly sophisticated and precise (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 9</ref>). This developed from excluding publications with zero citations to applying a higher threshold. Recognising that citation count is partly a function of the period of time that a publication has been out, some wanted to be able to calculate a normalised score. They also wanted to introduce complex thresholds that were a function of multiple indicators, but this was difficult.</p><p>The following quote from participant P3 illustrates how citation threshold was initially considered:</p><p>…using the slider, a quick scan [was done] on the information available to get a general idea on citations. The recent ones you don't expect to see very high citations so that's why at this point I was looking for citations which were not very high as a base.</p><p>As the card sets reduced, participants were increasingly able to perform manual exploration and triage for relevance based on title, keywords and also by reading abstracts. Distributing documents by time rather than simple chronological ordering was also performed at this stage allowing them to explore gaps in significant publications.</p><p>Once defined, these more complex analyses were iteratively applied to multiple card sets corresponding to other selected authors. In other words, once an analysis approach had been established for one set, it was then iteratively repeated on other sets. By performing consistent analyses over each sub-collection in this way, visual comparisons between documents sub-sets remained meaningful. Over time, these analyses permitted a process of elimination to be performed in which card sets corresponding to candidates that did not withstand iterative testing and comparison could be eliminated. This, in turn, enabled higher confidence in those that remained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4">Comparing candidates (Re-framing)</head><p>In the DFM, we see comparing frames (a sub activity of reframing) as the process of identifying influential candidates among ones that have some likelihood. We observed participants P2, P3, P5 &amp; P6 arranging card sets on the canvas in a way that supported easy visual comparison. In one example, this was done by placing author card sets side-by-side, reviewing indicators and examining differences (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>). P2 ordered cards by citation and visually compared how each candidate was performing. They also ordered the index cards by year to review gaps. P1 revisited manually derived citation ranking (written on paper), and reconsidered topic relevance.</p><p>The following quote from participant P2 illustrates how one participant aligned card sets in order to make visual comparisons: …the clusters were placed in such way, for easy comparison. I had the first person who popped up, and then I put the results for the next two. I used citations to make comparisons, along with the number of results.   Finally, we note some observations concerning the organisation of space. Using an unstructured canvas, participants P2, P3 &amp; P5 were able to establish an emergent organisation as the task progressed, implicitly recording intermediate analysis. Generally, five different areas were observed on participants' canvases: an area for preserving initial topic searches, an area for the base working set (which was sometimes refined), card sets corresponding to candidates less likely to be influential, an active workspace for card sets currently being explored, and an area for storing worked card sets representing candidate field leaders (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 11)</ref>. During the task, a good deal of activity involved moving between the base working set and the active workspace of cards being explored. Participants also deleted entire card sets of authors in order to eliminate them.</p><p>The following quote from participant P3 demonstrates how the unstructured canvas was used to externalise the thinking:</p><p>…[points to a section of the screen] this might be the stuff I am done with convenience but keep it there in case just as like these once I might need them back again [top left], and that was kind of over there mentally, probably not relevant but I might need to click on it quickly and remember what I did and go through the laborious process when I delete that author and find them again that's why they are there [bottom left of the screen], and the one I am more sure about are over here [right side of the screen].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">DISCUSSION AND DESIGN FRAMEWORK</head><p>We were interested in understanding the sense-making processes involved during the task of identifying key 'influencers' from a community of practice, how they were supported by INVISQUE, and what this could tell us about how people think. Findings show that participants were observed to do more than search and retrieve. They also attempted to construct meaning by filtering and querying the data to discover facts from which they could launch further enquiries. They were creating an understanding of the problem space. This is very much in line with Klein's et al.'s definition of the outcome of the sense-making process, in which a frame is a structured, supported explanation that guides the search for more data. However, establishing a working set could not be explained using the DFM.</p><p>During the process of establishing a working set, precision, recall and relevance were considered important factors by the participants. However, limitations in the implementation of the visual representations affected their ability to gain a desired overview of the working set of data. When establishing candidates, INVISQUE allowed participants to test early hypothesis such as authors who have highly cited publications are also likely to have a good publication record. The system allowed a data exploration with less commitment and high uncertainty, taking advantage of visual cues. Again, limitations of the design representations affected discovery of aggregated indicators (such as the ability to filter on multiple indicators). When exploring candidates, participants were able to test their initial hypotheses.</p><p>Simple functions such as sorting, organising, and deleting assisted with the identification of candidates of influence. However, observations that identified inconsistencies led participants to question their initial understanding. Thus, any further exploration required complex functions (using multiple indicators) that were not support by the current system.</p><p>As commitment increased, the volume of data reduced along with the complexity of the indicators. With the reduced datasets, participants were able to manually execute functions that were not made available by the system given the lower user-costs of doing so.</p><p>Throughout the task, participants were observed organising the canvas in way that made sense to them. Finally, during the final stage, participants organised the space to support easy visual comparisons. Participants were seen recalling the indicators used during the exploration stages and reapplying them to the established influences. However, they were unable to create a range of views to make comparisons.</p><p>The study and the analysis that used the DFM as a theoretical lens provided insight into how users progressed through the task and how their understanding and commitment changed.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">Implications for design</head><p>The study identified four fairly distinct stages of activity. This is not to say that they are conducted in a strict linear fashion, but broadly this seems to be the case. Based on the needs of each stage we propose the following design recommendations:</p><p>1. Better support for the creation of a working set. During the early stage of the task participants searched for and retrieved information, using Boolean combinations to optimise recall and precision. They conducted multiple searches and compared and combined them in different ways.</p><p>Design requirement: Offer the capability for conducting and maintaining and combining multiple searches in the field of view. Provide tools for performing gross sorting and cull operations. Useful tools may include query relevance indicators, faceted displays and entity extraction. Visual representations such as tag clouds showing aggregated indicators (e.g. publications of candidates or topic views), hybrid bar charts <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> which could show aggregated indicators in three dimensions (e.g. publications of candidates, citation count and referencing relationships). Additional text indicators and analyses may include query relevance indicators, sentiment analysis, tag clouds, cluster analysis and entity extraction.</p><p>2. Playful exploration. To begin the process of influencer identification participants explored data collections by performing various sorting operations on emergent indicators in ways which showed high uncertainty and required low commitment. This supported the exploration of early hunches in addition to becoming acquainted with salient cues and system features. They sorted and filtered in apparently opportunistic ways on parameters that they felt might be indicative of someone being an influencer. Extending beyond the academic domain, it may be very difficult to predict, a priori, the kinds of sort, ordering and highlighting parameters that users may want. However, in this stage and the next, participants were interested in features such as frequency of and gaps in publication, publication outlet impact, activity duration and coauthorship. These features may well have meaningful equivalents in a number of domains (e.g. citation in an academic domain may be seen as similar to re-tweeting in Twitter).</p><p>Design requirement: Offer a wide range of parameters for sorting and visualization allowing users to widen their understanding of individuals and documents in the data. Offering different views is likely to reduce bias by diluting the influences of one or a few extreme indicators. Low commitment, playful exploration is an important factor at this stage.</p><p>3. Enabling a shift towards increased commitment to selected candidate influencers. Participants 'set-aside' early hunches to see how they withstood deeper exploration in terms of the emerging indicators and complex user-determined filters.</p><p>3.1. Support easy construction of complex user-determined filters. Users wanted to filter information objects according to ad hoc, complex, normalised, parameters, in some cases with thresholds that they refined over time.</p><p>Design requirement: This could be supported in intuitive ways using the direct manipulation of thresholds over visual distributions of information objects. Complex filters could be created in a similar manner over multidimensional representations.</p><p>3.2. Support the iterative application of analytic actions to multiple card-sets. Once complex filters had been developed and applied to a given data collection, users wanted to iteratively reapply the same filters to other datasets for the sake of making meaningful comparisons between the results.</p><p>Design requirement: Enable users to capture the filters and views that they have applied to one collection and re-apply them easily to other collections.</p><p>4. Comparing candidates. Users laid out collections in corresponding ways (i.e. same view) in order to make visual comparisons. The ability to compare was constrained by the limitation of only being able to show one view per collection at a time. This meant that sub-sets could only normally be compared according to one parameter or at most two parameters at a time. Other comparisons would require a switch of views.</p><p>Design requirement: Allow users to create multiple simultaneous views of parameters relating to multiple collections -small multiples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper has reported on an explorative study of librarians searching for candidate 'influencers' in an academic domain using the INVISQUE system. Their thinking processes were externalised through the use of the system, which in turn allowed us to interpret how they used the system in search of insights.</p><p>The user study provided outcomes that can guide design. INVISQUE appeared to support some aspects of the task well, particularly early exploratory phases. More formal comparisons needed later on were less well supported. The ability to flexibly (c) (e) (a)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(b) (d)</formula><p>create, compare and combine search results helped participants to establish increasingly high quality and manageable working sets. This enabled them to analyse sets in terms of a number of indicators to identify patterns, which in turn informed filtering. As collection sizes reduced, so they were able to performed increasingly comprehensive and manual analyses (manual in the sense that they were less dependent on system metadata). They created collections as proxies for candidate 'frames' and compartmentalised areas of the canvas into task specific areas to store intermediate analysis products and visually record decisions and work done. Over time, the collections and analyses co-evolved with both coagulating from speculative exploration to more stable comparisons. By tightly coupling the interaction and visualization, an environment was created for the rapid interrogation, representation and visualization of data and their relationships, thus supporting the sense-making process.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>INVISQUE system showing two clusters.
