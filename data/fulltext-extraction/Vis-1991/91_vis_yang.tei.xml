				<p>Blood movement investigated by magnetic resonance (MR) velocity mapping is generally presented in the form of velocity components in one or more chosen velocity encoding directions. By viewing these components separately, it is difficult for MR practitioners to conceptualize and comprehend the underlying flow structures, especially when the image data has strong background noise. The flow visualization technique presented in this paper adapts the idea of particle tracing used in classical fluid dynamics for visualizing flow. By rendering and animating the processed flow signal, clear flow structures can be revealed. 202</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>To elucidate the possible connection between blood flow and the localized genesis and development of cardiovascular diseases, a considerable amount of research, both empirical and theoretical, has been carried out by many investigators. Much effort was made on the visualization of blood flow since it is believed that the disruption of normal flow patterns is a common manifestation of vascular diseases. Because of the difficulties in visualizing the detailed flow patterns in vivo, most of the flow studies have been conducted in virro using simplified models of heart or arteries. It may be questioned, however, to what extent the results obtained in such simplified models apply to the real situation where the vessel geometry is extremely complex, not only in shape but also in configurations. The need for a precise, flexible and non-invasive technique to quantify flow has motivated the research of applying Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging to the measurement of in vivo blood flow. One of the major advantages of using MR for blood flow measurement is that the flow itself is not affected by the measurement process. Moreover, unlike many of the other alternative methods, the MR technique is noninvasive and non-destructive. These advantages make the M R technique the method of choice for providing detailed answers to both clinical diagnosis and physiological problems of circulation within the human cardiovascular systems.</p><p>In this paper we shall address the problem of using M R velocity imaging methods to analyse flow within the human heart and arteries. This work is concentrated on the following two topics: the improvement of the quality of the MR velocity images, and the visualization method for the representation of the flow data. These two problems are equally important. As data is being collected it is inevitable that the flow signal is contaminated by noise and a technique is needed to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Without a correct way of representing the flow signal, it is difficult for MR practitioners to comprehend and understand the spatial and temporal structures of the flow field. Before we proceed to these problems, we shall first introduce the MR velocity imaging technique. However, it is not the intention of this paper to give an in depth description of the formation of MR velocity images. More detailed discussions of the technique can be found in [ 1-71.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">In Vivo MR Velocity Imaging</head><p>The potential of MR to quantify flow has been explored for more than 30 years. Although the advantages mentioned earlier have been appreciated since the early work on MR blood flow measurement, the technique did not make a large impact on medical practice. One of the main reasons for this was that the early methods yielded only bulk flow velocities with unknown accuracy, and these could not compete with the relatively low cost ultrasound techniques that were developing. For this reason, the interest in MR blood flow measurement waned for a period. With the development of improved MR imaging techniques there has been a resurgence of interest and today M R flow imaging techniques are beginning to provide more detailed answers to observing in vivo blood flow.</p><p>In clinical MR images, it is the hydrogen nuclei which give rise to the magnetic resonance signals.</p><p>Nuclei spin on their axes generating an intrinsic magnetism, or magnetic moment, that makes each nucleus a magnetic dipolein effect, a bar magnet. A useful analogy is to consider a spinning nucleus as the earth which possesses a similar though much larger magnetic moment. When these nuclei are placed in a magnetic field, the axes of spin precess about the direction of the applied magnetic field. The frequency of precession is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field that each nucleus experiences. The nuclei may be excited by the application of a radiofrequency <ref type="bibr">(RF)</ref> pulse perpendicular to the field and at the nuclei's precession frequency. This changes the angle (but not the axis) of precession by an amount depending on the strength and duration of the RF pulse. When the RF pulse is switched off, the nuclei gradually precess back to their original equilibrium positions.</p><p>While nuclei are returning to equilibrium, they emit radio signals at the frequency of precession which can be detected in a radio aerial and procased by a computer to generate images. In magnetic resonance studies, a slice of finite thickness is imaged, so that the image element has a height equal to the slice thickness and cross section equal to the pixel area. This three dimensional image element is called a voxel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>/ I</head><p>Axis of precession ' I Since the frequency of precession is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, when precessing magnetic moments move in a magnetic field gradient they exhibit a frequency shift related to their velocity along the gradient direction. This frequency shift multiplied by the time duration of its occurrence gives the accumulated number of precession cycles gained or lost with respect to unshifted magnetic moments depending on whether the magnetic moments move along or against the gradient direction. Its relative accumulation is called the phase shift. This resultant phase shift will be proportional to the velocity component in the direction of the gradient. Based on this information, a special phase-gradient-modularion technique <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref> has been developed to reconstruct the velocity distribution within the image plane. This method encodes directly the components of velocity of motion as true subject variables of the magnetization to be imaged, just as the conventional imaging modulations encode the spatial positions of the magnetization as subject variables.</p><p>In practice, inhomogeneities of the main magnetic field and susceptibility variations within the patient can also lead to phase changes. This can result in artefacts on the velocity images. To overcome this problem, one can acquire two images, one with velocity encoding gradients and the other without. The subtraction of the two yields an artefact free velocity map. A further refinement is necessary before velocity mapping is practical in large vessels. At the place where accelerations are large, a voxel may contain a wide range of different velocities, therefore a large number of resultant phases after the flow encoding sequence. Because these signals are out of phase with each other, they can cause signal loss. This is easily understandable if we consider that two sine waves with the same frequency but with different phases tend to cancel out each other. To alleviate this problem, a technique calledfield even echo rephasing (FEER) has been developed [7]. Although a significant improvement is achieved, intense turbulence within a voxel may still result in signal loss.  almost parallel with the alignment of the blood vessel, the velocity component along the third direction, the direction that is perpendicular to the plane, is very small and it is not shown here. These images are acquired by a Picker International Vista 2055 magnetic resonance machine operating at 0.5T with FEER velocity encoding sequences. Typically, for every velocity component we can acquire up to sixteen, or even thirty-two flow images timed to different time instances within a heart cycle. This set of images provides complete in vivo flow information within the selected image plane.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Velocity Signal Enhancement</head><p>The phase subtraction procedure mentioned to a large extent overcomes the artefact caused by an uneven magnetic field, but patient movement during data acquisition and other effects may also degrade the quality of the data. All these can result in background noise which can make interpretation of flow images difficult. It is desirable, therefore, that before we use computer graphics to visualize the flow signal, the background noise is removed.</p><p>Many conventional image processing techniques can be adapted for noise reduction; however, direct applications of these methods did not yield satisfactory results. The main reason for this is that the existing approaches are mostly applicable for two or three dimensional intensity images. For flow images every pixel (or voxel in 3D case) represents a vector quantity.</p><p>If we process the velocity component images separately, as is usually done for ordinary images, the correlation between velocity components is not used.</p><p>Our approach towards flow signal enhancement is based on the fact that intensity patterns generated by flow have an anisotropic nature, i.e., the variation of the velocity magnitude in the flow direction is much smaller than variations in any other directions, especially in the direction that is perpendicular to the flow. Of course, this assertion is only valid for flow within a local small area and in practice, for every pixel we can select a small neighbourhood by considering its nxn neighbours (usually 7x7 in our implementation). If we can estimate the principle flow direction within this local area and use this direction to compare it with the direction that each pixel represents, we can get an estimate of how reliable the signal is. Obviously, there is a high possibility of this if the velocity direction of the pixel is parallel with the principle flow direction. However, there is a very small probability that the velocity vector is perpendicular to the principle flow direction. Based upon this, we can easily justify if a pixel needs further processing or not; that is, if the coherence between the two directions is lower than a pre-selected threshold then we consider this signal is corrupted by noise and it is replaced by a new value through interpolation from its neighbours. Yet again, the weights we put on each neighbour for interpolation is also based on the reliability of the signal it represents. This process is schematically illustrated in  It is not difficult to see that the essential part of our approach is to construct a robust local orientation detector &amp;OD in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>) to estimate the principle flow direction from noisy data This problem is solved by considering the frequency composition of local flow pattems. It can be proved that the intensity pattems generated by flow which satisfy the assumptions stated earlier, are manifested by energy clustering in the Fourier domain. That is, within a local area, the three dimensional Fourier spectrum of the flow velocity magnitude is confined within a plane in the frequency space, and the normal of this plane points towards the principle flow direction. In the two dimensional case the Fourier spectrum clusters along a line and the direction that is perpendicular to this line provides the principle flow direction. By fitting this plane (or line in 2D case) with least mean square errors, the desired principle direction can then be defined. We further show that this process can be converted into a matrix eigenvalue problem by constructing the second moment matrix of the Fourier spectrum of the velocity magnitude distribution within a local window. The eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of the second moment matrix can be used to define the principle flow direction. Full mathematical details of this method and an efficient algorithm are given in W I .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Flow Visualization</head><p>exposure of the developing infant to the visual characteristics of its surroundings <ref type="bibr">[IO]</ref>. This means that the power of perception, though repeatedly tested against everyday situations for accuracy, is very much dependent on the contingency of the experiences of each individual subject. We are used to seeing flow as a field of streamlines but not as separate velocity components.</p><p>Because of this, even experienced researches sometimes find it extremely difficult to reconstruct and comprehend the flow field in their mind.</p><p>To solve this problem we sought to represent the flow signal in a form that is more acceptable to observers. A simple solution to this is to use arrows which show the direction and the magnitude of every velocity vector. However, visually arrows do not provide satisfactory result, especially when the arrow maps are animated to show the pulsatile flow. Readers can assess this by looking at <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. We find that <ref type="figure">Figure 4(b)</ref> more effectively represents the flow field.</p><p>The first step for flow animation is to render the flow field. Here we adapted the idea that is used for particle tracing method in fluid dynamics. The particle tracing method used in traditional flow visualization is to observe the motion and the path lines of the tracer particles that are dispersed in the fluid. From n frames of images ( v l , ... ,vn) showing the velocity distributions within a selected image plane at different time instances within a cardiac cycle, we frst randomly "throw" a number of tracer particles into the flow field v1 and they move according to their velocity assigned.</p><p>At the next time instance %. these particles move to their new positions and the moving velocity for every particle is updated according to velocity distribution v2. Then the particles move again. This process continues until t, , after which the next velocity distribution for updating is v 1 and the Cycle is completed. The shape for every particle is rendered according to the following relation:</p><p>Problems arise while images representing different vector components are examined by MR practitioners.</p><p>By viewing these components separately, it is difficult for them to conceptualize and comprehend the suuctures of the flow fields. ne psychological reason behid this is quite obvious. Research into the psyc~o~ogy of perception strongly suggests that the ability to see forms is the result of a learning process, based on the where po is the centre of the particle moving with velocity v and 6, ,6, are preselected constants which control the anisotropisation of the particle. During the animation process, new particles are generated while the old ones move out of the plane or vanish. "Throwing" new particles into the field is based on the particle density of a local region. If the density of the region is too low then some new particles are generated. Equivalently, we can also consider the divergence of the local vector field. If div R &gt; 0, the net movement of the particles is towards the outside of the window and new particles should be generated within this area. It has been demonstrated that this method for flow animation provides considerable help for flow structure understanding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experimental Results</head><p>The visualization method described above has been applied to a number of normal and abnormal studies for analysing flow within heart and arteries. <ref type="figure">Figure 5.</ref> shows the blood flow passing through the aortic valve of a normal subject. For readers who are not very familiar with the anatomy of the heart, we have illustrated the position of the selected image plane in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. The flow structure is clearly visible, especially two vortices near the aortic valve. It is interesting that as early as 1513, Leonard0 da Vinci was trying to predict the flow pattern around the flexible cusps of the valve when they are open. He argued that when the blood is pumped through the valve it encounters the progressively restricted neck of the aorta and it is forced in part to turn back on itself in a spiral motion. The revolving of the resulting vortices within the flexible cusps of the aortic valve fills these cusps, thus closing the valve until the next body of the blood is forced between them. However, as he recognised, determining the precise patterns of the flow is extremely difficult " I t is doubtful i f the percussion made by the impetus ... divides the impetus into WO parts, one of which revolves upwards and the other turns backwards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Such doubts are subtle and difficult to prove and</head><p>His doubts can now be cleared by using MR velocity imaging techniques. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref> shows another study of the blood flow in the right atrial chamber of a human heart. Streams enter from the great veins, the superior vena cava (SVC) from above and the inferior vena cava (IVC) from below (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6a</ref>). It can be seen that the two opposing streams (from SVC and IVC) do not collide head on, but are deflected forwards and downwards, in a common stream between two vortices. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows the flow in the right and left auiums of a patient. A hole between the two heart chambers (an atrial septal defect) is detected from the flow patterns which show blood streaming down and to the right of the image through the defect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clar&amp;.'' 6 Conclusions</head><p>In this paper techniques for flow image processing and in vivo flow visualization have been presented. The flow image processing relies on the strong correlation between the principal flow direction estimated from the distribution of the modulus of the velocity field and the direction derived from the raw image data. By correlation calculation, severe background noise can be eliminated. Flow pattern rendering and animation provides an efficient way for representing intemal flow structures. We are working towards combining multiple slice flow images to reconstruct and visualize flow structures in 3D. We believe it is possible that in the near future, these techniques for visualizing the flow data produced by MR velocity mapping will give important information on flow within the heart that is unobtainable by other methods.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Defiition of ten" for the concepts of nuclear spin and precession</figDesc></figure>
