				<p>In this work, we have developed an algorithm based on mathematical morphology, image processing, and volume rendering to enhance the visual perception of definite and abstract structures embedded in multidimensional data undergoing visualization. This erosion procedure enhances the depth and shape perception of structures present in the data beyond the perception facilitated by shading and contrasty colors alone [Gershon, 19901. The utility of this algorithm is demonstrated in medical imaging (Positron Emission Tomography) and climate (sea surface temperature) data. The resulting information is displayed in stereo.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>One of the main issues in visualization is how to depict effectively structures and patterns hidden in multidimensional data. An effective visualization procedure is one which allows the observer to perceive spontaneously as much information as possible. Such effective visualization procedures could facilitate understanding of multidimensional data generated by simulations and by various devices in medical imaging [e.g., Positron Emission Tomography (PET)], oceanography (e.g., sea surface temperature), and earth science, just to mention a few.</p><p>Data could contain either previously known or unknown spatial structures, or both. To perceive and identify these structures, it is important to be able to discern their shapes and locations (including depth) in the visualization space (e.g., cartesian space, or cartesian space with time). It has been recently * This work was funded by The MITRE Corporation as part of The MITRE Sponsored Research <ref type="bibr">(MSR)</ref> program.</p><p>demonstrated <ref type="bibr">[Gershon, 19901</ref> that by choosing colorsthat enhance the contrast between the brightness of a structure and its surrounding areas, one could improve both depth and shape perceptions of structures embedded in PET data. In this work, we have developed an algorithm based on mathematical morphology, image processing, and volume rendering that further enhances the perception of depth and shape of structures embedded in multidimensional data. 'Ihe effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated in visualization of medical imaging (PET) and climate (sea surface temperature) data. The resulting information is displayed in stereo.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PET and Climate Data</head><p>PET and climate data were used to illustrate the advantages of using the combination of mathematical morphology, image processing, and volume rendering to enhance the perception of structures in multidimensional data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">PET</head><p>Positron Emission Tomography is a medical imaging technique depicting the functional characteristics of anatomical tissues such as the brain.</p><p>The functional characteristics depicted by PET are thought to be associated with the various underlying anatomical components. PET results are expressed in grey scale images with brightness levels varying according to the levels of metabolic activity. The observer would like to perceive levels of brightness, shapes, and locations of regions of metabolic activity and correlate these regions with the corresponding anatomical structures. There are four main characteristics associated with PET image data and with human visual perception that can degrade the quality of perception of information. The first is the CH30464/sl/oO00/oles/Sol .OO Q 1991 IEEE ~-~ relative low resolution of the incoming data (.5 to 1.5 cm in plane) compared with most other medical imaging techniques. The second is the difficulty in perceiving absolute brightness levels. This characteristic is 8ssociated with the fact that the human visual perception of brightness level of a region may depend upon the brightness levels of its neighboring regions <ref type="bibr">[Luckiesh,</ref><ref type="bibr">1%5]</ref>. This phenomenon is called brightness contrast. The third characteristic of PET data which degrade-s the quality of perception is the use of a series of two-dimensional (2-D) slices to represent three-dimensional (3-D) structures. The perception of 3-D information could be improved by displaying the sets of 2-D slices as a 3-D image volume. The use of stereo viewing and/or motion could be used to make hard-to-see features more visible. The fourth characteristic affecting perception is the shortage of anatomical information in PET data. PET measures metabolic activity and thus does not depict anatomical structure directly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Climate Data</head><p>The ocean and atmosphere interact to transport heat from the equatorial region towards the poles. Sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the components in the mechanism of this heat exchange. The occasional extreme warming of the Pacific Ocean equatorial region off the coast of Peru, known as El Nino, is considered to be the cause of severe weather changes. The most recent two El Ninos occurred during the periods <ref type="bibr">of 1982/1983 and 1985/1986</ref>. These SST patterns are not thought to be coupled with underlying fixed structures as in the case of PET, and thus could be abstract and time varying. To better understand the dynamics of the development of these El Nino occurrences, we have constructed a four-dimensional visualization space. This space is composed of SST measurements taken of the Eastern Pacific region at different times, where x and y axes are the location on the surface, and the time is taken as the z axis. Thus, each set of measurements at a particular time is considered to be a slice in a tomographical sense. The temperature is the fourth dimension. To visualize these patterns effectively, one must enhance the brightness contrast between regions with different temperatures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Visualization Hardware</head><p>The hardware system consisted of a Pixar I1 Imaging Computer (VICOM Systems, California), a Sun 3/180 (Sun Microsystems, Mountain View, California) used as a host computer, and a Stedraphics (San Rafael, California) stem display.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">PET Data Acquisition</head><p>PET data was obtained from normal subjects and patients with Dementia of the Alzheimer Type (DAT) using Scanditronix Model 1024-7B at the Warren Magnuson Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. Each set contained 14 images. The in-plane resolution of the PET images (128 by 128 pixels) was 6 mm, and the axial resolution was 6.9 mm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">SST Data Acquisition</head><p>Sea surface temperature (SST) is measured either by recording the radiation emitted by the ocean surface as collected by radiometers residing on satellites or by in situ measurements performed by thermometers residing on ships or buoys. A global blended SST data set generated from these two types of measurements was created by R. Reynolds [ 19881. The data used is the monthly blended average SST as a function of longitude and latitude coordinates and time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Visualization Procedure</head><p>To render and visualize image volumes of PET and SST data, we have combined a new algorithm for enhancing the apparent brightness and brightness contrast of regions in visualized image volumes with a procedure described earlier <ref type="bibr">[Gershon, 19901.</ref> The different steps in the visualization procedure are described in the following paragraphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1">Classification</head><p>Different regions in the image volume are defined by classification. This is achieved by dividing the grey level range into a number of distinct regions and by assigning a color (pseudocolor) and opacity value to each region. The structures contained in the data are represented by the spatial locations and shapes of the regions defined by the classification procedure. This classification step is analogous to color density slicing often performed with twedimensional images.</p><p>PET data was classified into four regions, high, medium-high, medium-low, and low metabolic rates. The colors assigned to these regions were white, green, blue, and black, respectively. The opacity of the regions with high metabolic rates was chosen to be fully opaque (opacity=l) which is three times higher than the opacity of the other regions (.33).</p><p>SST data for the El Nino of 1982/1983 was processed as follows. For the period of April 1982 through April 1983, the deviations from a typical normal SST were calculated by subtracting the corresponding typical normal SST (e.g., 12 months later). Thus, for example, the values of the monthly average of August 1983 were subtracted from the August 1982 monthly average SST for each latitudelongitude location. For illustrative purposes only, positive (warming) values for 180 to 270 latitude degrees and 45 through 135 longitudinal degrees (covering the main El Nino region) were included. This procedure yielded 13 monthly data slices. The range of positive temperature deviations was divided to 6 brightness regions. The color used were white, orange, green, purple, blue, and black. The opacity assignments were l . , . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">49, .33, .33, .20, and 0,</ref> respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2">Structure Visualization</head><p>For both data sets, depth information of structures embedded in the classified regions was accentuated using shading, stereo, and motion. The stereo perception was made possible by applying a simple rotation (5 degrees in the case of PET, and 6 degrees for the SST) around the image volume center. Since perspective was not used in the creation of projections of the image volume, this method of stereo pair generation does not create artifacts that could severely degrade the ease of stereo viewing. Shading, created by the reflection of a simulated light from the surfaces present in the image volume, improves shape and stereo perceptions. The resulting stereo pairs could be viewed on the StereoGraphics stereo screen, or by means of stereo pair photographs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.43">Enhancing the Structure Brightness Contrast</head><p>Most depth cues are sensitive to brightness rather than to hue contrast Livingstone and Hubel, 19881. It has been recently demonstrated <ref type="bibr">[Gershon, 19901</ref> that the assignment of pseudocolor scale that enhances the brightness contrast of a region with its surroundings improves the depth perception of this region. The algorithm developed in this work sharpens the surfaces embedded in the image volume and thus further enhances the brightness contrast between each region and its neighborhood. This algorithm is based on the erosion operation of mathematical morphology (see the general reference of Sera [ 19821).</p><p>During the volume rendering procedure (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Drebin et a1 [1988]</ref>), surfaces are defined by calculating spatial gradients. The reflections of a simulated light from these surfaces are then calculated.</p><p>The sharper a surface, more light is reflected from it and the contrast with its neighbors may increase. Thus, its chances to be visible in the visualization space are increased. The erosion procedure developed in this work is designed to enhance the sharpness of surface at the boundary of each classified region. This procedure consists of the following steps:</p><p>(1) Separating each 2-D image (from which the image volume is to be generated) into a set of n subimages.</p><p>Each subimage contains regions which were classified in the same way. In the case of classification based on grey level values, each subimage contains pixels within a specified range of grey level (brightness). Thus, there were 4 subimages in the PET and 6 subimages in the SST data.</p><p>(2) Creating a binary image for each subimage. This step consists of assigning a maximal grey level value for each of the pixels which originally (in the subimage) had grey level values different from zero. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>The results of PET glucose metabolism in a normal brain visualized using the erosion algorithm am given in figure 1. The same brain metabolism visualized without the erosion is given in figure 2.</p><p>Comparing the two figures shows that the use of the erosion algorithm yields sharper boundaries among the various regions, brighter surfaces, and higher contrast between different regions and their background. These differences make the stereo perception beuer in figure 1 than in figure 2. Shape perception of the various components is better too. Among the discernible anatomical components are the interhemispheric fissure, caudate nucleus, the thalamus, and parts of the cortex associated with high metabolic activity.</p><p>The results of the 1982-1983 El Nino data showing regions of elevated temperature in 3-D are depicted in figure 3. Again, the application of the erosion algorithm yields sharper boundaries and surfaces, brighter surfaces, and higher contrast. These enhanced features lead to better definition of regions with elevated temperatures and to a better depth perception. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> depicts the system from April 1982 through April 1983, where the earlier times are plotted closer to the viewer. It is apparent from figure 3 that the regions adjacent to the central highly warm region (depicted in white, orange, and green) are also warm (although to a lesser degree) in the months preceding the peak of El Nino.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>It is clear from figures 1-3 that the erosion algorithm creates sharper and brighter surfaces. Since the immediate background surrounding each region of a particular grey level range is now dark, the contrast between the brightness of a region and its background is thus enhanced. This brightness contrast of a point relative to its neighboring pixels increases the amount of "surfaceness" of this point, and thus the amount of simulated light reflected from it. In addition, the shading results are more effective.</p><p>The improvements in sharpness, brightness, brightness contrast, and shading help in the perception of the information buried in the data in a number of ways. First, it assists in discerning the regions from their background. Second, the shapes of the different regions are more easily recognized. This is an important issue especially in PET data where assigning the observed metabolic activity to an anatomical component is crucial to understanding brain metabolism. The third way is the contribution of the enhanced brightness contrast and shading to a better determination of the location (including depth) in a stereo view.</p><p>In creating a visual information display, it is important to be able to increase the amount of information that could be perceived spontaneously by the viewer (with little or no "thinking," e.g., see <ref type="bibr">[Friedhoff, 19891)</ref>. By sharpening the surfaces present in the data, and by creating (using erosion) dark gaps between the different regions, or objects, one improves the spontaneity of observing these regions. In addition, if there is an underlying symmetry in the data, its impression could be perceived spontaneously only when the symmetry is around a vertical axis <ref type="bibr">[Rock, 19741</ref>. Also, as ambiguous figures can be perceived in different ways depending on the orientation assigned to them [Rock, 19741, orientation is extremely important in shape recognition and data understanding. Thus in brain data, it is important to display the data with the interhemispheric fissure aligned vertically (see figures 1-2). To perceive symmetrical patterns or shuctws in data where symmetry is unknown, such as in climate data, it is essential to observe the visualized data in different orientations. Observing the data in different orientations on a time varying basis can help in perceiving the depth information. In our laboratory setup, the PET and climate data are displayed in stem and in motion. The combination of shading, stereo, and motion yields a strong depth perception of the data.</p><p>In conclusion, the use of an erosion algorithm to enhance the appearance, sharpness, brightness, and brightness contrast of regions in 3-D image volumes assists in displaying depth and shape information in displays of multi-dimensional data. Such displays could not only improve spontaneous visualization but also be used for browsing through massive amounts of data. Storing the resulting projected views rather than a large amount of individual image slices (representing temporal and structural data) could save storage space and enhance information access and understanding.    <ref type="bibr">Gershon,</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> A stereo pair depicting a 3-D image volume of cerebral glucose metabolism of a normal subject computed using the erosion algorithm The view IS fror the top of ?he brain where the front IS on the upper side The range of the metabolic activity is aivided into four rogions represented b y white. green, blue, and black (for the hlgh. medium-high. medium-low, and low rates, respectively) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> The same dola as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> , b-r+ processed without applying the erosion ulgor'trm The deviations are from a monthly average of a normal month (1 2 months later) wh te represents the nighest and black tbe lowest ternperoture deviation range The coordinate system composed of the locotiorl (xy) plane and the time (z) axis, is rotated 45 degrees around an axis parallel to they axis This view is taken from miow +he image volume such +hat the right-hand side of the xy plane I S in the west side</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>( 3 )( 4 )</head><label>34</label><figDesc>Shaving the outside boundary of each region in the binarized subimages by performing an erosion operation [see e.g., Sera, 19821 with a kernel of 2 by 2 pixels.
