<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>This environmental visualization project involves the work of several technical disciplines and addresses data needs relevant to the U.S. Air Force's Installation Restoration Program (IRP). The IRP is designed to accomplish environmental restoration of hazardous material sites located on U.S. Air Force property.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">The McClellan AFB Installation Restoration Program</head><p>McClellan AFB is located approximately seven miles northeast of downtown Sacramento, California.</p><p>From 1939 to the early 195Os, the base operated as a bomber depot, while in the early 1950s. the base became a jet fighter maintenance depot. McClellan AFB currently operates as an air logistics center. Its primary mission is the management, maintenance, and repair of aircraft, electronics and communication equipment. While fulfilling its past and current mission to defend the United States through the operation and maintenance of bomber and jet aircraft, the base has engaged in a wide variety of activities that have required the use, storage and disposal of hazardous materials.</p><p>Materials used at the base have included industrial solvents, caustic cleaners, electroplating chemicals, heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls, low-level radioactive wastes, and a variety of fuel oils and lubricants The IRP is structured to encompass three primary phases over time: an assessment phase, an investigation and study phase, and a remedial action phase. In the first phase, a data sampling program is designed to characterize the environmental contamination situation at the site. It involves chemistry, hydrology, geology, and environmental science. Eventually the data will serve as the foundation upon which estimates of the scope of the remediation program on the Air Force base can be made. In the second phase. technical solutions based on environmental process engineering practice and research are evaluated while the site characterization situation is considered. This phase would include civil engineering assessments of the extent of contamination that requires removal and treatment and the costs to carry out the program. The final program phase involves detailed design and construction actions for remedial work itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">The Need for an Information Management System</head><p>Since 1979, the IRP has generated over 200 volumes of technical reports regarding the degree and extent of contamination at the base. The purpose of the TIS is to accumulate and relate environmental data collected from many different sampling programs over the course of many years and that exist in a variety of formats.</p><p>The TIS tool set can then provide for visualization and analysis of the data for assessing site conditions, modelling remediation actions, and visualizing the outcome and the consequences of the remediation program on the environmental situation on base.</p><p>IRP programs at over 100 active Air Force installations share similar data management and analysis problems. The McClellan AFB TIS is cited in the Air</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Force-Wide Installation Restoration Program Information</head><p>Management System Technical Implementation Plan <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> as a prototype of geographical information system (GIS)/spatial analysis capabilities that can be applicable to a wider community of IRP managers and analysts across the Air Force who have similar data and presentation needs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Interdisciplinary Aspects of the Project</head><p>The IRP itself is interdiscipIinary in nature and the TIS that will support the program takes on an interdisciplinary character as well. The TIS involves accumulating and presenting data and analytical results from the environmental science and engineering work that takes place in the program in an intuitive and comprehensible way to support the decision process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TIS system development relies on information</head><p>engineering, structured development and prototyping techniques, and system engineering; while presentation of the technical information, and its analysis, must take careful account of the requirements for management decision making in the program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Prototyping to Establish Visualization Requirements</head><p>Often when visualization is a key element in a system's functional capability, prototyping can be an effective development tool [2]. The look, feel, presentation, and general user interface are critical elements in delivering the expected functionality to the end user of the system. htotyping can help refine requirements for the look, feel, flexibility, and general user presentation format for data visualization.</p><p>A prototyping approach is based on the traditional attributes of good engineering practice, to wit:" build a little, test a little." The prototype involves the end user in an effective communication exchange with the pertinent development parties. It engages the end user in testing a sample of the contemplated fully functional system against his expectations for the system. Feedback from the user helps refine requirements, prioritize system features, and improve understanding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>It provides a tangible benchmark that facilitates communication between the user, developer and component vendors.</head><p>A combination of rapid prototyping and traditional systems engineering techniques were used to establish the functional requirements and preliminary design of the </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>This f m generation system prototype was</head><p>developed to test user reaction and expectations for the system. During this series of "hands on" test sessions, system functionality was demonstrated and the usen expectations and requirements recorded for incorporation into the full-scale prototype. While the environmental data consists largely of sampled measurements that reside in a character-based RDBMS, these sessions presented that environmental data t o the user in a visual form. The RDBMS was integrated with the GIS through an "X" windows standard as implemented by the hardware vendor which provided nearly seamless message passing between the applications. The data and message exchange between the RDBMS and the GIS was very smooth and gave the uset the sense that a single application was in use, rather than an integrated collection of otherwise independent software packages.</p><p>The GIS is used as a presentation "back end" to the RDBMS data base system; it presents comprehensive site data, accessed from the RDBMS, in a comprehensible visual way for a McClellan AFB environmental manager. Queries against the RDBMS are made through the GUI that presents a "point and shoot" structured query language (SQL) statement generator for the analyst's use. The data returned from the RDBMS is passed to the GIs, which then provides either a map-based or Cartesian-based presentation of the data for the analyst.</p><p>Data for prototyping functionality was acquired from several sources both from base archives and from contractors. Water-borne contamination sampling and analysis data that already existed in digital form was located and input to the RDBMS. These included thousands of samples for a wide variety of chemicals taken at over 100 sites around the base over the course of many yeius. The McClellan AFB Comprehensive Civil Engineering Plan, which includes facility location information in digital form, was also obtained and enteM in the prototype data base.</p><p>Prototype applications that were suitable for user testing were devised based upon needs identified during the preliminary needs assessment phase of the project. The EM directorate will be proceeding with a fullscale prototype development project based on the success of the first generation prototype. The full scale prototype will take advantage of the latest in commercial off-the-shelf workstation technology, visualization tools and data management software.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Functional Requirements and Preliminary</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>The applications outlined below were identified by McClellan AFB staff during the prototyping sessions with the first generation system as the core set of applications critical to the success of the TIS, and ultimately, to the successful implementation of the IRP.</p><p>These applications will become the object of the second generation prototype which will be a comprehensive test of applications, data availability, and hardware and software.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Three Dimensional Maps and Displays</head><p>The Air Force has spent a considerable sum of money to collect data regarding the extent of contamination at McClellan AFB, and other Air Force bases as well. One goal of collecting all of these data is to develop a conceptual model of the degree and extent of contamination, so that decisions can be made regarding the need for and design of remedial activities. Often, these data are presented to the decision makers in page after page of tabular appendices to R4FS reports.</p><p>Presentation of the data in three-dimensional graphical format will allow decision makers to get a f m e r grasp on the degree and extent of contamination, and its location relative to potential receptors and to better assess remedial actions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Three-Dimensional Conceptual Site Models:</head><p>A conceptual site model is intended to synthesize information regarding the degree and extent of contamination at a site, the projected migration routes, and location of potential receptors.</p><p>The threedimensional conceptual site model should present data for all envrrunmental media on a single graphic. That is, the graphic should display surface land use characteristics; the degree and extent of contamination; details regarding the hydrogeological characteristics of the site; details regarding environmental sampling locations (e.g., monitoring well screen intervals); possible pathways for migration of contaminants from the site; and location of potential receptors.</p><p>Volumetric Displays and Calculations: The ability to display the extent of contamination and determine the volume of contaminated soil and water is very important to the IRP. This application will be capable of displaying the extent of contamination to a level specified by the user. It will be capable of estimating volumes of contaminated soils and groundwater, and displaying the results in the message window. The application will also be capable of calculating volumes of uncontaminated overburden if applicable.</p><p>Lithological Cross-Sections: Information regarding the stratigraphy underlying the base is important for understanding and projecting how contaminants may be transported. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Two Dimensional Maps</head><p>Two-dimensional displays of data can sometimes convey certain information more clearly than threedimensional displays. Like their three-dimensional counterparts, two-dimensional maps allow decision makers to get a f m e r grasp on the degree and extent of contamination than tabular analytical data. McClellan AFB has developed illustrations of their generic twodimensional map needs [3]. A typical two-dimensional display of data combines analytical results, often contours, with information about surface land use. Boolean operations can be performed through application of SQL query clauses on maps created in the TIS. For example, a new map can be derived from existing maps that could locate areas of organic contaminant high enough to warrant bioremediation and yet possess concentrations of heavy metals low enough so that the bioremediation can be safely done.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two-Dimensional Contouring:</head><p>The objective of automated contouring is to portray the concentration of a certain attribute or variable that varies spatially on a two-dimensional map. Contouring algorithms use point data to generate isopleths, or lines of equal value, of the variable being considered. The variable may be groundwater levels, concentrations of environmental contaminants, or other environmental parameters. The application will also allow for the rasterization of the  In Three Dimensions purposes of establishing a location estimate of the isopleths of interest.</p><p>Map Overlays: The ability to drape, or overlay one map on top of another is critical to providing the user with an understanding of the degree and extent of contamination from the possible contaminants at a site.</p><p>The TIS will be capable of overlaying any spatial data set on top of any other spatial data set. This includes the ability to overlay maps generated from the relational database with other spatial data sets. This capability will extend to the ability to drape existing maps onto new two-and three-dimensional maps. For instance, it will be possible to overlay the Base Civil Engineering Plan on top of a fishnet plot generated from data stored in the RDBMS.</p><p>Map Digitization (Siting for Remedial Activities): Digitizing is the process of converting an analog image or map into a digital form that can be manipulated by the computer. The TIS will support creation of digital maps using a mouse and specialized digitizing equipment. A simple desktop mouse will be sufficient to meet EMR's needs. The system will allow the user to enter descriptive information about the object being digitized. It will allow the user to assign names or tags to points, lines, and polygons, and will allow the user to verify the topology of the drawing being created.</p><p>Boolean Operations On Maps: Most, if not all, GISs allow the user to perform Boolean operations on maps. One of the benefits of a GIS is that it gives the user the ability to combine data from diverse sources. The types of operations a typical user might want to perform on sets of maps includes the following:</p><p>Adding two m p s . For instance, given maps illustrating the concentrations of chromium, lead, and selenium, the user might want to create a new map showing the total concentration of metals.</p><p>Subtracting WO maps. For instance, given two maps showing the concentration of the same contaminant at two different time periods, the user might want to produce a map showing the change in concentration from time A to time B.</p><p>Performing a Boolean "AND". Given two or more maps, each illustrating some set of spatially referenced attributes, the user might create a new representation of the information that locates areas which have both some characteristics from one map as well as characteristics from the second map.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Trends Analysis</head><p>The ability to analyze environmental data for trends in space and time is critical to the success of the TIS and to the successful completion of the IRP.</p><p>Contaminant Levels Versus Time: The analysis of contamination levels versus time can assist the investigator in determining the direction and rate of contaminant migration. Applications to analyze the environmental data for trends will produce displays showing both the raw data points and the line or curve fitted to the data, as illustrated in figure 3. Equations describing the trend and estimations of the reliability of those equations will be displayed in the message area of the screen.</p><p>Groundwater Level Measurements Versus Time: Groundwater levels at McClellan AFB change spatially and temporally. They depend on the level of rainfall over time, and on pumping of the aquifer for the local water supply and on efforts to extract contaminated groundwater for treatment by the base.</p><p>Spatial Variability of Environmental Parameters: Environmental data are often neither totally random nor totally detenninistic. A branch of statistics known as "geostatistics" has developed to deal with the concept of a regionalized variable. Given a set of geo-referenced data, such as the distribution of groundwater levels or contamination versus space, the system will produce a plot of the semivariogram for the data and estimate the range or span of the variable over the area of interest.</p><p>Analysis of Treatability Study Data: The remedial design phase of the IRP may involve conducting a number of small-scale treatability studies. Data from treatability studies will vary versus both space and time. The purpose of analyzing data from treatability studies is to determine whether remedial actions that have worked in small scale benchtop simulations or in fullscale implementations under different environmental conditions will be effective at McClellan AFB.</p><p>Effectiveness of Remedial Activities: The Air Force needs to report to the regulatory community on the effectiveness of its remedial activities and accelerated response activities. For example, a demonstration of the effectiveness of the groundwater treatment plant could include plots of the trends versus time of the concentration of contaminants at the extraction well and in the effluent of the associated groundwater treatment plant. The purpose of such an application is to allow McClellan AFB to monitor the effectiveness of its treatment operations, and to report on the effectiveness of those operations to the public and the regulatory community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSION</head><p>McClellan AFB faces a considerable challenge to meet the cleanup goals established by the Air Force. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>[5]. In 1979, officials at McClellan AFB began to suspect that past waste disposal practices were contributing to groundwater contamination in the area of the base. McClellan AFB voluntarily began an investigation of groundwater contamination in the vicinity of the base. In July, 1981, the Department of Defense @OD) established the IRP to investigate hazardous materials disposal at military installations, and the McClellan AFB program was revised to conform to the IRP. There are approximately 170 confirmed sites and/or potential release locations at McClellan AFB.</figDesc></figure>
