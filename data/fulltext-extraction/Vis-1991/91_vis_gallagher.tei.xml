				<p>Techniques for displaying 3 0 isovalues of scalar fields such as stress within a solidfinite element model generally involve aamining each elementfor values of interest. An inexpensive, straigh#orwarui method is discussed to reduce the number of elements searched for such isovalues. It takes advantage of one traversal of the element data to yielda compact classification of the model by result values andranges, with no sorting required. This data structure can then relate any scalar isovalue to a set of element groups which are closely inclusive of the isovalue. This method is intended for applications requiring repeated access to the analysis data, such as animation and interactive rendering of isosurfaces and scalar fields. While applicable to general volume visualization problems, it is particularly well suited to optimizing real-valued continuum field results such those found in finite element result data.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Volume visualization is a fairly recent specialty within the computer graphics field, concerned with the display of a 3-dimensional state of behavior witbin a solid volume. Many of these techniques have their roots in the analysis of medical and scientific data, but in recent years numerous applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> have successfully applied these techniques to finite element models. These models generally consist of coarse, irregular volume elements with floating point result values computed at vertices.</p><p>In many 3D analysis models, it is common that only a small percentage of its elements are "hits" which contain an isovalue of interest. The rest are "misses" which are not a part of the threshold itself. Applications in this area are evolving towards interactive or animated display of varying threshold values in 3D. with increasingly large and complex models. As hardware polygon transformation and display become increasingly real-time, reducing the number of volume elements examined becomes one of the major issues in optimizing the computational side of processing such interactive displays.</p><p>Numerous algorithms exist for the evaluation and rendering of volume data, and can be split into two basic forms. The first kind involve classification and rendering of the volume as a continuum, often using general ray-tracing or depth buffering approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19]</ref>. Here, we are more concemed with the second kind of algorithm, which seeks to detect isovalues within individual volume elements. These values can then be rendered from each element at display time, generally as polygons or surfaces fit through the element <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">11]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Such algorithms generally execute in time proportional</head><p>to the number of elements in the volume data set, and can effectively be viewed as a "filter" to the process of examining each element. More importantly, they can be directly adapted to volume finite elements without the need to compute and store a volume continuum from the element data.</p><p>At the same time, these approaches require a complete re-traversal of the element data for each image using new isovalues. This approach seeks to take advantange of an initial pass through the element data to optimize it for repeated display processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Current Optimization Approaches</head><p>Given the fairly recent emergence of current volume display algorithms, techniques for optimizing the performance of these methods are at a very early stage. Nonetheless, the large scale of volume datasets, and the associated issues of rendering results from them, have spawned a few approaches to date.</p><p>Many of the volume continuum techniques have a termination criteria for each ray evaluated, where volume elements behind a state of total opacity are not processed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In addition, the cell-by-cell method of Upson's V-buffer</head><p>[ 181 employs a numbering scheme allowing processing of CH3046-0/91/0000/0068/$01.00 0 1991 IEEE certain independent volume cells in parallel. A very active recent area of effort has been in adaptive processing of the volume space, where a coarser sampling density locates mas of interest for more detailed processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20]</ref>.</p><p>Others take a hybrid approach of using a coarse ray tracing as a basis for computing shaded polygoas <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Data compression techniques such as run-length encoding can serve as a coarse filte!ring mechanism for locating areas of interest, by grouping like image or volume elements together. Filtering operations are common for the presmoothg of image processing data <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17]</ref>. Pattern representation approaches have been proposed as a means of optimizing the display of raster images [ 161, while octrees have been used as a means of compressing a volume array <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>. Another approach involves following isovalues across adjacent elements [ 13 however, this q u i r e s "seed" elements, and is less appropriate for the multiple disjoint isosurfaces common in finite element results.</p><p>By comparison,the algorithminthis paperoptimizesthe model based on its data values rather than simple compression or the results of its rendering. It uses a data compression scheme similar to -length encoding, but based on assigned ID values rather than geometric location, and combines it w i t h a classification based on the element values and their span. The result is a compact table which can be searched by d t value for elements of intemt.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Overview of Algorithm</head><p>This algorithm takes a list of elements, with scalar values at their vertices, and produces a compressed data structure groupd to easily produce a smaller list of elements which include a given isovalue. Its basic steps m as follows:</p><p>-The total range of results is divided into discrete sub-ranges, or "buckets".</p><p>-Each element is examined by the lower bound of its vertex values, and the number of buckets its range of vertex values span. This: latter value is referred to as its "span length".</p><p>-This element is grouped where possible with adjacent elements sharing the same lower bound bucket and span length. (Adjacency in this context means having consecutive ID numbers, and not neccesarily being physically adjacent. Finite elements, which can be randomly locatedinspace, are accessed by means of an ID number defined when the element is created.)</p><p>-These groups of one or more elements are then added to lists corresponding to their lower bound bucket, within a larger list (a "span list") grouped by the number of buckets this group spans, e.g. its span length.</p><p>The data structure contains apredefined number of these "span lists"there is om list for element groups fully contained within a bucket, another for element groups spanning no more than N buckets, and finally one for element groups spanning any number of buckets greater contains lists of element groups, classified by the bucket containing that group's lower bound value.</p><p>Ihe end result of this oae-pass classification is a set of discrete and completely disjoint compressed ID lists which can be quickly examined for those element groups which could contain the value of interest. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> contains an overview of the data structure.</p><p>To 6nd the element groups corresponding to a given isovalue, each span list is examined starting at the bucket list for the value. Within that span list, the lower bound lists at or below that bucket am retrieved, for the number of buckets corresponding to that list's maximum span length. For a case where there are four span lists, corresponding to span lengtbs of 1,2, 3 and 4 or more, the search for elements contaioing a given value is as follows:</p><p>than the previous span lists. Each of these span lists -In the first list, element groups in the bucket list for this value are searched for elements containing the isovalue.</p><p>-For the second list, this bucket and the one below it are searched.</p><p>-For the third list, this bucket and the two below it are searched.</p><p>-In the final list, this bucket and all buckets below it are searcbd, to the start of that list.</p><p>This process is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Element Classification</head><p>As a first step before looking at each element, the possible range of scalar values in the model are divided up into anumber of ranges, or "buckets", These ranges can be a linear subdivision of the range, or can be clustered around values of particular interest, such as a failure criteria. This use of discrete buckets is important for storing element group data, in that it avoids the need for sorting. As each element group, containing one or more consecutive elements within the same span tolerance, is processed, it is added to a singly linked list for the appropriate bucket in each span list, as shown in Rgure 4. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">O*i, =39 omax =41 span = 2</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Evaluating the Data Structure</head><p>Atdisplay time, thedatastructureis read toproduce alist of element groups which is guaranteed to include all element groups containing the current result value.</p><p>Starting with the smallest span length, each span list is read staaing at the list for the bucket range containing the result value. After these element groups are evaluated and rendered, ifthe span length of this span list is N greater than one, the next N bucket lists below this value (or above, if upper bounds are used) are then evaluated. This process continues for each span list, until the last span list has all buckets from result to the end of the list evaluated.</p><p>The span lengths themselves contain useful data in evaluating volume fields, in that longer spans specrfy areas of high gradients within the field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Performance and Memory Issues</head><p>With this method, the net computational savings are seen as how many fewer elements are processed for a given isovalue. Its ideal case is one where there is a continuous variation of the result value, large groups of adjacent elements within a similar value range, and minimum span of values within elements. These criteria are generally well suited to field analysis problems such as finite element analyses.</p><p>Conversely, the worst case occurs when a high percentage of elements have large spans of values, and little compression of adjacent values is possible. This means that this method is less useful with general volume datasets with a great deal of "noise" unless pre-filtering is employed to produce more regular data. Changing the number of span lists to 3 and 2 had a very minor effect on search time, generally 1-2 per cent or less, in both this and the following example. As a continuum field, large single-element aansitions in value are less common, while always possible.  <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows a finite element model of a volume channel, representing one-quarter of a circular plate with a groove within it. It is composed of 750 3D volume elements with 8 vertices, and has a pressure loading applied to the interior face of the model. Using 10 bucket levels across 4 span lists, the initial database of 750 elements was compressed to 61 volume element groups, or 2.4 per cent of the basic connectivity and result data memory. Using 20 bucket levels and 4 span lists, 104 groups or 4.1 per cent of the basic memory was used. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes the results for values at the mid-range of each 10 per cent of the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Example 2 -Square Block</head><p>For this case, the display of each of these 10 isovalues in sequence requires looking at 16.3 per cent of the number of elements we would have had to examine from the entire model. In addition, the average ratio of elements containing the isosurface to those searched increased from 6.8percent to over50percent. <ref type="figure">Figure 6showstheelement</ref> fields searched for a sample isovalue.</p><p>Increasing the number of buckets "evened out" the distribution of valuessome values were searched more model for the 10 bucket case and 19.4 per cent for the 20 bucket case. 'Ihe statistics are shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>Using 5 buckets produced similar results as with the example abovea smaller number of groups (1 88), more elements in the larger buckets and less in the smaller ones, and a drop (8 per cent) in the average ratio of elements containing the isovalue to elements searched. These two examples make it clear that a fairly coarse number of buckets performs optimallymore buckets increased memory requkments in both cases with little or no overall performance increase. Even with an extremely coarse structure, element search time is significantly improved.</p></div>

Example 3 -Hydrogen Orbital Volume</head><p>As an example of using this algorithm with a larger-scale problem, a general volume model of a hydrogen orbital was also optimized with this approach The results were comparable to those obtained from the smaller finite element models.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Summary</head><p>This method represents a one-pass optimization technique which greatly reduces the number of elements searched within an analysis model for the rendering of isovalues. It trades off a moderate increase in storage for a substantial reduction in the iterations of the display processing loop. Additionally, the resulting dataset provides useful feedback unto itself on the distribution of values within the model. Over time, we are seeing a substantial increase in the application of volume visualization techniques to analysis problems such as finite element models, with clear trends towards more interactive display of behavior and larger, more complex models. Optimization techniques such as the one presented here can form a basis to navigate such data quickly on the basis of results as well as geomeq, and increase the overall throughput of evaluating analysis data as volume imagery. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>3 .Figure 1 4 Figure 2 .</head><label>3142</label><figDesc>Add to Linked List in Appropriate Data Structure by Span Length Evaluation of Data Structures for a a-value Within Bucket a4.

Note Smaller Value Ranges May Still Contain Larger Spans.Each element is then examined, once, in order of its element ID. Finiteelementmodels, unlike general volume data, are not guaranteed to have a regular geometric pattem. These elements cannot generally be accessed by geometric location without a search.When each element is processed, its vertex values are evaluated to determine the span of their scalar values. The span is determined trivially for volume element i as:s, =u,u,-u,,Next the number of span buckets contained within this element group is then determined. For the general case whem there is an even subdivision of N buckets between the minimum and maximum values, the number of buckets spanned would be computed as:bucket-bucket-+ 1 bucket,,,,,, = INT [ ( (U----')num-buckets] U&amp;) + and Umaxbeing the global minimum and maximum values for the entire model and U-, the local minimum and maximum values for element group (i).If the element shares the same lower bound bucket and bucket span as the current element group, this element is added to the group. A simple representation of the starting element ID and number of consecutive elements following is used to describe the element group. If a element is not within the same bucket and span length, it is used as the base address of a new element group.</figDesc></figure>

In the examples below, using a 10 bucket, 4 span list data structure, the number of element groups created as a percentage of total elements ranged from a best case of 8.1 per cent for a model with high gradients along the element numbering to a worst case of 24.1 per cent for a model where the results were much less localized. However, the groups themselves use much less memory than the finite element data itself, whichcomprises floating point vertex values as well as connectivity between vertices.
