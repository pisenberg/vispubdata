				<p>A hyperbox is a 2-dimensional depiction of an. Ndimensional box (recta.ngular pa.rallelepiped). Th.is paper defines the visual syntax of hyperboxes, states some properties, and sketches t w o applications. Hyperboxes can be evocative visual names for tensors or multidiiiiensiona.1 orrays i n visual progra.inining 1angua.ges. They con also be u.sed t o simulta.n,eou.sly display a.11 pairwise relataonships i n an N-dimensional dataset. W e show that this can be helpful i n choosing a sequence of dimension-redu.cing transformations that preserve interesting .properties of the dataset some operations on hyperboxes. Section 4 suggests u9ing hyperboxes to represent multidimensional arrays Section 5 examines the use of hyperboxes to lielp organize the search for appropriate dimension-redncit~g mappings for a multidimensioiial dataset. The example explored here, LU-decomposition of a nonsingular matrix, is probably not be of iiitriiisic interest to the visualization community, but it illustrates the kinds of insights that can arise in studying multidimensional data. The paper concludes with some final ohservatioiis and open problems.</p>

Occasionally, this can be done without loss of information. One such instance, presented briefly in section 3, occurs when the original information is the size of a multidimensional array. Usually, the trip from Ndimensions down t.o 2 entails a massive loss of information. Visualizat.ion of N-dimensional datasets discussed in sect,ioii 4 is tShe archetypical example. Tlie task here is t.o chose a collection of dimension-reducing mappings that. preserve interesting properties of t,he data. This t.ask is usually difficult and someCimes impossible.</p><p>This paper present.s a tool t.0 help visualize multidimensional iiiformat,ion ca.lled t,he hypcrbor. A hyperbox is a 2-dimensional depict.ion of ail A'-diniciisio~ial rectangular parallelrpipcd (box). Tlie fundament a1 pr0pert.y of a hyperbox is t.1ia.t it. cont.ains a parallplogram for every pair of dimensions. This will a.llow all pairwise relat.ions1iips of a mult~idimensional dataset to be displayed a t 01ic.e. It also facit,ilatcs viewing sonie t,riples of dimensioiis as 3-dimensional boxes.</p><p>Section 2 defines t,he hyperbox. Sect.ion 3 presents Hyperboxes are very constrained pictures.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The result is a hyperbox of dimension N :</head><p>Zero-, one-, t,woand t.hree-dimensional hyperboxes Some ot.her hyperboxes:</p><p>3 Propert,ies of a hyperbox.</p><p>A hyperbox of dimensioii N contains N 2 line segments. It. is a subset of a wire frame model of an N-dimensional box (with N * ZN-' segments):</p><p>The hyperbox appears less cluttered.</p><p>A hyperhox of dimension N has N ( N -1)/2 parallelograms called faces. A fundamental property of the hyperbox is that for each pair of canonical segments, there is exactly one face with edges parallel to the two segments. Thus, the hyperbox is particularly convenient for identifying or displaying information associated with the 2-dimensional subspaces of N-dimensional space.</p><p>For each canonical segment, there are N -1 other segments with the same length and orientation. These N segments form a direction set of the hyperbox. A hyperbox of dimension N -1 can be obtained by collapsing all the segments of a direction set to have zero length:</p><p>Selecting a point on a segment implicitly se1ect.s the corresponding points on the other segments of the same direction set. These points may he connected by a sequence of line segments parallel to existing segments. Such a sequence will be called a cut. It is often fruitful t o cut a direction set IC times: then split, it into k + 1 hyperboxes of dimension N :</p><p>then collapse each of these hyperhoxes along the cut. Loosely speaking, a tensor is a matrix with an arbitrary number of dimensions. The hyperbox was developed to depict tensors within the ALEX visual programming paradigm. Each of the direction sets of a hyperbox corresponds to a dimension of a tensor. Operations 011 tensors can be defined in terms of their effect on a typical sltce, where a slice is a tensor with one fewer dimension obtained by fixing one coordinate of the original tensor. (Thus, the slices of a matrix are its rows and columns, and the slices of a vector are its elements.) A slice can be represented as a c u t through the tensor's hyperbox. A slice can he selected by clicking on an edge; operations on pairs of dimensions (such as a partial transpose) can be indicated hy clicking in a parallelogram.</p><p>Depicting N-dimensional d a h on paper or a computer screen requires somehow folding N down to 2. There are many known techniques for accomplishing this, see for instance [C 73, ID 90, T 83, T YO]. As powerful workstations become common, there is increasing interest in int.eractive programs for view-</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ing multidimensional data [A 85, B 90, LWW YO, MGTS 901.</formula><p>The hyperbox has applkatioiis bo bot.11 areas. 1t.s N ( N -1)/2 faces can display all parallel orthographic projections of the data onto two dimensions. As a t.ool in an int.eractive syst,em, the hyperbox adds struct.ure to the sequence of steps taken in displaying data. We will i1lustrat.e t,hese points by an example.</p><p>The data of our example conies from a crude simulation of a linear algebra applicat.ion (LU decomposition of a 15x15 matrix) running on a 4-processor shared-memory multiprocessor. The heart of t.he comput,at.ion is a triply-nested loop. We will refer to these three loops by indices that. are commonly known in t lie c.ommunity, i, j, and k. At. each instant. of time each processor performs one of the following operations:</p><p>compare (determine pivot in current column); divide (invert the current. pivot.); u p d a t e (decrement by a product); or wait (for data computed by another processor). The raw data is a set of tuples of the form: chosen to provide a reasonable amount of space for each parallelogram; thus, time was compressed to 3 cycles per pixel, whereas operation and processor values were expanded.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">&lt; i , j, k,</formula><p>Just as reading topographical maps or mechanical drawings is a learned skill, extracting insight from these pictures requires a little practice. Someone familiar wit,li linear algebra algorithms might notice several features of this picture. Tlie processor versus j face shows that each processor is responsible for a contiguous set of j-values. This shows the algorithm uses what is known as block-column data distribution. The i versus k and j versus k faces are triangles, corresponding in a natural way to the lower-and upper-triangular matrices that are produced by the program. The roughly parabolic shapes in the i, j, and k versus time faces, reflects the fact that later stages of the computation require a smaller number of operations. The iiestiiig order of tlie loops is also shown by the activity in these faces; the index variable for the outermost loop, k, changes most slowly.</p><p>Observe in the time versus processor face that one processor completes about a tliird of t.he way through, aiid the second and third processor finish early also. This might suggest looking for a more efficient distribution of the data to processors. Also notice in tlie time versus operation face that there are periods when one processor is waiting for data from another (wait being tlie topmost operation in the picture.)</p><p>To understand the interrelationships between the data in the different dimensions better, well known techniques can be used to collapse dimensions of the hyperbox: Color Plate 1 labels operations by colors: wait is red; <ref type="figure">(&amp;O COIN @tCr, poO.4 18.)</ref> divide is purple; compare is light blue; and update is yellow. The now redundant, operation dimension has been dropped. The correspondence between data's dimensions and direction sets is the same as before, making it easier to orient oneself to the new plate.</p><p>Some technical details in our hyperbox program affect Color Plate 1. When several pixels are projected onto tlie same location, the one with the most recent time obscures the others. To partially offset this choice, the sizes of the individual blots were clioseii so that. the operations we are most interested in ( t h e waits aiid divides) often peek out from beliind data with later time values. This makes it apparent that cycles are wasted when one processor is looking for a pivot element or performing a divide. It is a harder to see, but some of the waiting periods are shorter than others, due to the fact that tlie leading processor sometimes gets ahead of the others.</p><p>A different, appreciation of the time dependence of the computation can be gained by lumping times into periods: Color P1at.e 2 (See color plwh, page 418.)</p><p>Color Plat,e 2 eliniinat.es t.he time dimension by small mult.ip1es. The time direction set. is rut. into four approxiniat.ely equal seg~iient.s, the hyperl,ox is split. along the cuts, and tlie four restilt~ing hyperboxes are each collapsed along blie time coordiiiat,e. Tlie proressor dimension has also been colla.prd in order 1.0 ma.ke a smaller pict.nre.</p></div>

Empty hyperboxes have been elided. While the ensemble is still quite complicated, the individual facets of this image are now quibe simple and easy to examine. Relationships between facets may also be perceived.</p><p>Another technique for exploring the dependence of t.lie wliole 011 one of its coordinate parts is to take a snapshot: Color Plate 4</p><p>The hyperbox in Color P1a.t.e 4 ha.s been collapsed along t,lie i direct,ion set., only t.lie data corresponding to the value i=10 are shown. An animat.ion going through all values of i would powerfully convey t.he algorithm's progress Mirough t.ime.</p><p>A hyperbox is a 2-dimensional picture that. corresponds to an N-dimensional box. It. ha3 a fare for every pair of dimensions of the original box. It. call be used to represent multidimensional arrays and t,o display simultaneously all 2-dimensional orthographic projections of N-dimensional daba sets. It. can also be used to help organize the search for a collection of dimension-reducing transformations that preserve interesting properties of the data. As this latter act,ivit,y is almost entirely heuristic, the following observations may be in order.</p><p>The designer of a hyperbox has a great, deal of freedom in choosing the slopes and 1eiigt.h~ of the segment.^ of each direction. Choices can be made that. enhance the ability of the viewer t,o read bhe picture. Ma.int,a.ining consistency here helps orient. the viewer from one picture to the next. Lengths can be chosen to be proportional to the ranges of values for the appr0priat.e dimensions; alternatively, the more important, dimensions can be made larger. One can choose slopes so that, parallelograms of interest are not too skewed. Finally, notice that certain 3-dimensional subspacesnamely those with adjacent canonical segments representing their coordinated axesstand out naturally as 3-dimensional boxes in the hyperbox. If some 3dimensioiial subspaces are intrinsically more int.erest.ing than others, this fact can guide the ordering of t,he canonical segments.</p><p>Looking back over the paper blie first thing we noticed is the remarkable efficacy of color to label a small number of items. Discussion of the LU decompositioii algorithm could have been st.udied using black and white hyperboxes, but it. was much easier when color was used to show a third dimension.</p><p>T h e e open questions remain. First, are there better techniques for orthographic projection ont,o two dimensions? When many dimensions are colla.pset1 t.0 two, several data point. get. mapped to t.he same po-&amp;ion. How should this set, of point,s be displayed at bhat. posit,ion? Our basic solut,ion was to use di~p1i1.v t.0 point wit.11 olie greakst. time va.lue. But. we c1iea.twI t.0 a.llow more important poinbs t,o "peek out" from hhind later ones. Other solutions niiglit. involve weight.ing and averaging t l i p poi1it.s in t h e set.. Second, ar? t.lieir alt.ernatives to o r t h o g i -~p h i~ project.ion? Helidering t,o create t.he illusion of prrspect,ive is an alternat.iw fm 3-dimensional dat.a sets.
