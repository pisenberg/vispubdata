<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Flow Visualization</head><p>Dying to view or visualize patterns created by fluid flowing over or around an object is a challenging task. This is especially true when the fluid is transparent, like air or water, and is moving a t high velocity. Flow visualization (FV) provides a useful tool for a better understanding of the phenomena of fluid mechanics.</p><p>Wolfgang Merzkirch (141 defines FV in the following way:</p><p>The insight into a physical process is always improved if a pattern, produced by or related to this process, can be observed by visual inspection. This becomes obvious if we think of a fluid-mechanical process where a fluid is flowing in a channel or around a solid obstacle. By observing such a flow pattern, which might be stationary or variable with time, one can get an idea of the whole development of the flow. However, most fluids, gaseous or liquid, are transparent media, and their motion remains invisible to the human eye during a direct observation. To be able to recognize the motion of the fluid, one 2 Imaging Techniques For Flow Visualization</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Tracers Techniques</head><p>Tracer techniques comprises all techniques where a foreign material is added to the flowing fluid (gaseous or liquid). The foreign material must be visible. If the particles of foreign substance are small enough, one may assume that the motion (direction and magnitude of the velocity) of these particles is the same as that of the fluid. The visualization is an indirect method, because we observe the motion of the foreign material instead of the fluid itself. The difference between the movement of the fluid and that of the foreign particle can be minimized, but can not be totally avoided, by almost coinciding the density of the foreign material with that of the fluid <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[14]</ref>. Smoke-wire, smoke generators and neutrally-buoyant bubbles are just a few of the ways of using tracer techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Density Techniques</head><p>Density technique of flow visualization is based on fluid density. Since fluid density is a function of the refractive index of the flowing medium, compressible flows can be made visible with certain optical methods. These techniques are sensitive to changes of the index of refraction in the field under investigation. In optical terms, the flow field with varying density is a phase object; that is, a light beam transmitted through this object is affected about its optical phase. The intensity or amplitude of the light remains unchanged after the passage through the object. From the pattern in the recording plane one can make conclusions about the density variations in the flow field ~4 1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Combination of Tracer and Density</head><p>This technique is a combination of the abovementioned techniques. Here, the foreign substance introduced into the flowing field is energy, e.g., as heat or electrical discharge. Sometimes an optical visualization is needed to visualize the increased energy levels of the fluid element. In other cases, the energy release can be so high that the .marked-fluid elements become self-luminous and can be directly observed. These methods are often applied to flow with a low average density level. Sometimes density changes in such flows can be too weak to be detected by an o p tical method. Hence, this third group of visualization techniques can be applied to the class of rarefied or low-density gas flows [14]. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">3-D Reconstruction Techniques</head><p>All techniques presented so far, except for holography, provide a 2-D view of FV data. In (81, a different way of viewing FV data in 3-D is provided. The first method consist of reconstructing solid cross sections using a emission-absorption method. The result is a view of a solid with an adjustable degree of transparency, which allows information hidden by the external surface of the structure to be seen. On the other hand, it lacks important depth cues produced by effects of shadows and intensity coding. Another recorded on a sensitive two-dimensional photon detector, and the recorded digital data is displayed using hidden surface removal and shading.</p><p>Another technique is stereopsis where two slightly different images of the same object is used [8]. The presence of depth cuing is strong. In [13] a method for both acquiring and displaying 3-D flow is described. After cutting the (forced jet) flow with a laser and recording the image with a CCD camera, the image is reconstructed using surface rendering techniques. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Volume Rendering</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Normal Volume</head><p>A surface is considered to be the boundary between materials of different densities. These boundaries are shown by the difference in adjacent values in the data volume. On a surface of constant density, the gradient (the direction of largest increase in values) is perpendicular to the surface tangential vector and therefore parallel to the normal.</p><p>The gradient vector G can be estimated using central differences along the three-coordinate axes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Shaded Volume</head><p>The major purpose of shading is to highlight surface within the volume. It gives a 3-D appearance to the volume by providing depth cues. The shading algorithm requires information about the surface, specifically their location and normal.</p><p>Once the normal has been calculated, the shading function can be applied. This shading model only considers ambient and diffuse reflection. The light source is considered to be at infinity, yielding a constant value for every light ray. Rays from the light source are not attenuated as they travel through the volume. The equation is: The specular term was left out for three reasons. First, it adds only a few visual cues in a volume without distinct surfaces. Secondly, specular reflection adds glare. This is not desirable, particularly while viewing medical data. Finally, without the specular term, the shading equation is independent of the viewpoint. This allows the user to alter the view without reshading the volume. Distance from the viewpoint was left out for the same reason. Depth cuing can be accomplished during ray casting <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Sx(z,</formula><p>After the gradient is normalized, surfaces appear within a material in the final image. This helps to visualize the variation of values within a material. However, the surfaces representing the boundaries between materials are difficult to differentiate from the other surfaces.</p><p>Often an image is desired that highlights the boundaries between materials and displays a continuous variation within a material. The values in an opacity volume created by a look-uptable mapping exhibit this behavior. The change in values between materials or at certain locations is very sharp. Within a material the change of values is smooth and continuous. Therefore, the desired image can be achieved by applying a gradient to the opacity volume instead of the original volume.</p><p>A function (called viewing angle) allows the user to set the parameters for the view plane. This provides freedom to the user to view the volume from any desired position.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Rendering</head><p>This process creates an image file based on the viewing plane location and the contents of the color/opacity volume and the shaded volume. Each point in the viewing plane is generated by using frontto-back ray-casting or back-to-front ray-casting algorithm. Ray-tracing algorithm can be used if desired. Much of the rendering process requires displaying several voxels or points, each with an assigned color and opacity, where some are partially or fully covering the others. In such a case, how much of a voxel or point is seen is dependent on the opacity of all the voxels or points in front of it.</p><p>To project a point onto a pixel, the opacity of the point determines how much pixel is covered. For example, if the r,g,b triplet for point A is (1.0, 0.0, 1.0) and the opacity is 0.5, the color for that pixel will be (0.5, 0.0, 0.5). If two points, A and B, both project onto a pixel, the resulting color for that pixel is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">C = FA x Q A x CA + Fg x ~g x Cg (7)</formula><p>where C = color of the pixel Q A , ag = opacity of points A and B respectively CA, CB = color of points A and B respectively FA = fraction of A that covers the pixel FB = fraction of B that covers the pixel.</p><p>coverage of point A is solely determined by its opacity, while point B is only shown in the area that is not covered by point A. Therefore, the corresponding fractions are FA = 1 and FB = (1 -QA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(8)</head><p>The equation then becomes</p><p>The front-to-back ray casting model accumulates the opacity for the pixel as the ray traverses the volume. The accumulated opacity a! from two points is given by</p><p>Once the point of intersection between a ray and the volume is located, a modified digital differential analyzer (DDA) algorithm is used to collect values along the ray as it traverses the volume. The ray traverses the volume one voxel at a time in the direction (t, y, or z ) of greatest change along the ray. In this fashion, we are guaranteed to sample every voxel along the ray.</p><p>During volume rendering the user has the option of rendering the volume with perspective or orthographic projection [I]. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[18]</ref>, it is suggested that orthographic projections often result in depth ambiguities and reversals of apparent depth. In the orthographic view, there is a lack of perspective depth cues causing size and orientation ambiguity. In the perspective projection, these problems are not present. Perspective projection can provide depth cues that are needed in volume rendering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DATA INTERPOLATION AND APPROXIMATION</head><p>As each ray traverses through the volume for raytracing or ray-casting, the ray might not intercept a point within the volume each time it is incremented to a new position. A new value must be calculated in relation to the surrounding points values. Interpolation is a method used to estimate this new value based on a curve passing through a set of given points. Another method is approximation, which estimates the new value based on a curve that approximates or approaches a given set of points. We have incorporated linear interpolation and B-spline approximation for the the volume rendering algorithm. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">B-Spline Approximation</head><p>Some curve-defining techniques interpolate a given set of points, which means that the curve produced passes exactly through the points. An alternate a p proach is to let a curve approximate or approach the given points. A B-spline will approximate a curve for a given set of control points. Most curve defining techniques, such as Bezier curve or a pc-curve, do not provide for local control of the shape. Consequently, local changes tend to be propagated throughout, the entire curve. B-spline avoids this problem by using a special blending function that has only local influence and depends on a few neighboring control points. B-spline solid representation is a set of blending functions that combines the effect of p + 1, q + 1 and r + 1 control points.  <ref type="figure">cc c p i j k N i , C ( u ) N j , , ( u )</ref> and</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">-( U -ti)Ni,i-l(u) + ( t i + l -u)Ni+l,i-l(u) - ti+l-l -ti ti+1 -t i t 1<label>(17)</label></formula><p>where (I -1) is the degree of the resulting polynomial in U and thus also controls the continuity of the curve. The same equations are used for calculating <ref type="figure">Nj,,,,('v)</ref> and Nk,,(w) blending functions.</p><p>In a B-spline implementation, the control points are the vertices contained within the volume. Instead of using the z, y, and z coordinates of a control point to calculate the new value, the intensity value (in our case, gray level) stored at that point is used.</p><p>The following procedure is a pseudo code for calculating a new point with a B-spline function. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Data Acquisition</head><p>The data used for this project was provided by a Canadian research facility, Ottawa, Canada. The data was recorded on a video tape containing both dynamic and static tests. The individual slices were acquired by using a image processing system installed in a PC/AT. The software used to acquire the images was written by Scott Williams'. During the test, the laser was passed back and forth over the length of the delta wing in a couple of seconds. This required that each frame be frozen on the video tape to digitize multiple slices that are back to back (Az = 1). A total of 120 slices were digitized from the video tape. A few of the two-dimensional slices that were acquired are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The image files were then moved to a Sparc Sun work station where the two-dimensional slices were rendered into a volume.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Rendering</head><p>The flow-visualization data was rendered without using a color/opacity look-up table for our initial implementation. If the objects in the images were to be classified, then a color/opacity look-up table would be used to classify the objects. Next, the opacity and shaded volumes were created. The approximate system time required to create the opacity and shaded volumes for different number of slices is listed in Tables 2 and 3.</p><p>The approximate system time required to render a volume for different viewing angles is listed in <ref type="table">Table  3</ref>. The following sections describe some enhancements that can be made to the volume rendering programs.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[15]</ref>, a technique of efficiently representing large quantity of data is presented. STICKS Representation Scheme can be used while ray casting or ray-tracing a volume. The hope is to allow volume rendering in computers with limited memory. In STICK algorithm, only one slice is used at a time. We will like to extend our package to use STICKS representation.</p><p>Perspective projection adds important perceptual cues. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[18]</ref>, two new techniques are presented that makes perspective projection more feasible. First, a method is presented for efficient slice-by-slice processing of volume data. Second, an adaptive ray splitting approach is described that ensures that the entire volume is sampled within user specified limits. We will like to incorporate these ideas in our implementation.</p><p>Vortex identification is important in fluid mechanic especially in the aerospace area. We will like to automatically report them.
