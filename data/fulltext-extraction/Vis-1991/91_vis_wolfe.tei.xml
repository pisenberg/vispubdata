				<p>We apply volumetric rendering to the interpretation of atomic-scale data generated from quantum molecular dynamics computations. In particular, we examine silicon Computations, and we discover that volumetric visualization of the computed 3 0 electronic charge density is a valuable tool for identifying defect states in silicon lattices in which oxygen atoms occur as impurities. Rendering of several judiciously selected ranges of charge density in translucent colors provides an effective means of identifying broken or altered molecular bonds and induced charge excesses in the lattice. The resulting 30 images reveal important features missed previously in 2 0 charge density contour maps. We find that stereoscopic &quot;blink comparison&quot; of image pairs is an extremely valuable way to study the structural differences among various configurations and that time animation provides significant insight into the molecular dynamics. We conclude that our success with silicon implies that the technique has the potential to provide a significant benefit to other problems in computational condensed matter physics.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In this paper, we describe the use of volumetric rendering for interpreting the computed electronic structure of solids. The structure, manifested as an atomic-scale 3D electronic charge density, is computed from a pure mathematical model. The mathematical technique represents a relatively new class of ab initio computations which have employed the power of supercomputers to revolutionize the field of theoretical condensed matter physics. These methods predict the atomic structure by solving the equations of quantum mechanics, starting basically with the atomic number. Such a pure computational approach represents a form of experimentation in which the "experimentor," the person running the computation, has complete control over the "experiment," the computational realization of the numerical model of the material. This approach has enabled for the first time a complete understanding of the structure of solids. However, the approach is not without its costs. Ab initio methods are computationally expensive, and they produce a large amount of output in the form of 3D fields. The difficulty in understanding and interpreting the results may rival the computational expense in hindering analysis; hence we were encouraged to pursue improved vi-sualization, especially of the electronic charge density, that would facilitate a more efficient interpretation.</p><p>Previous molecular visualization efforts have concentrated on the geometric relationships of the atoms and their bonds, as expressible by "ball and stick" models. More recently, attention has tumed to visualizing the electronic charge density, mainly by rendering surfaces of constant density[ 11. With a judicious choice of density value, such a surface alludes to the general bonding morphology. However, constant density surfaces miss subtle variations in the density field. Based on quantum mechanical wave characteristics, we tend to imagine the valence electrons in a molecular structure as a cloud concentrated around the atomic nuclei; therefore it makes sense to consider imaging the full range of charge density as a translucent medium in which the optical properties are related to the density. However, only a few renderings of the resulting featureless forms are needed to convince us that simultaneous visualization of all the density values is not a viable alternative. Instead, our approach combines the descrete value aspects of the surface approach with the physical intuitiveness of the cloud approach. We select specific, interesting intervals of charge density to visualize, and we render a density interval as a luminescent cloud. As we will show, this approach reveals the bonding morphology, as do constant density surfaces, but it also preserves the evidence of density variations within the interval. The key to its effectiveness is the proper choice of data intervals and data dependence of optical parameters within those intervals.</p><p>In the next section we describe our visualization application and briefly review some of the important physics aspects.</p><p>Then, we describe our volumetric visualization technique and the rationale for our display choices. We then show how our visualization is used to interpret the computations for silicon with an oxygen impurity. Finally, we consider methods of communicating the results, and we present our conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Physical Problem</head><p>We demonstrate the use of our approach for visualizing the computation of the structure of silicon with an oxygen impurity. This problem is not only important in its own right, but it represents the use of a b initio computation and volumetric visualization for modeling numerous other materials with impurities. It is very t Jointly with MIT. Currently at A. T. &amp; T. Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ 07974 CH3046-0/91/0000/0109/$01.00 Q 1991 IEEE difficult to grow pure silicon, and oxygen generally remains as the major impurity. We need to understand its effect on the silicon so that we can gauge how tolerable it is and perhaps even identify ways to exploit its presence. We address three important cases: how an oxygen atom bonds in a silicon lattice in equilibrium, what happens when a second oxygen atom is added, and how an oxygen atom can migrate through the silicon lattice.</p><p>We employ quantum molecular dynamics (QMD), an uh inirio method introduced in recent years <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, in performing our calculations of minimum energy configurations. A detailed discussion of the physics background of oxygen in silicon and of the computational method is provided in related papers <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>[4] ; however we briefly review several of the physics aspects as they relate to the visualization. We use density functional theory to reduce the complicated problem of interacting electrons to a simpler problem in which a single electron is subjected to the composite effect of all the other electrons. We replace the true electrostatic potential with a pseudopotential that lumps the inner (non-valence) electrons with the positive atomic nuclei, and we solve for the distribution of valence electrons, that is the electronic charge density.</p><p>Although we are dealing with only one or two oxygen atoms in the silicon lattice, translational symmetries in the lattice suggest that we might simplify the computation if we could assume periodicity in general. Indeed, we can make a super-cell approximation in which we solve the problem for a 3D periodic array of oxygen sites, which adequately models a single occurrence if the periods are taken long enough. The directions of the symmetry translations and the chosen periods dictate the geometry of the supercell. In general, the cell does not have orthogonal axes, but they are at least related to Cartesian space by a 3D affine transformation. Our computations reported here utilize two different cells containing 16 and 32 silicon atoms, respectively.</p><p>The computations iteratively redistribute the cloud of electrons and adjust the nuclear positions so as to minimize the total energy. During the electron redistribution, the nuclei are held fixed. Then, the nuclei are allowed to move according to the forces imposed by the redistributed electrons. Then, the electrons are allowed again to redistribute, etc. To model different configurations of oxygen bonding in equilibrium, we start with different initial conditions and iterate until the forces on the nuclei vanish. When we model the dynamics of oxygen migration, our iterations represent a time sequence of the motion.</p><p>The electronic charge density is computed in units of electrons per computation cell. Since our computations have employ2d two different cell sizes, we have chosen to standardize all charge densities to the cell of 16 silicon atoms. For example, a density value of one means the charge density realized if one electron were smeared ovcr the 16-atom cell. The computations for pure silicon yield an average charge density of 64 electrons per cell, the number contributed by the four valence electrons belonging to each of the 16 silicon atoms. In all o u r computations the charge density varies from about seven to 215, except in the immediate vicinity of an oxygen nucleus, where it rises steeply to about 1800.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Visualization</head><p>The data we wish to visualize include the valence electron charge density and the configuration of the nuclei, the former being a spatially extensive scalar field and the latter expressed as spatial coordinates. In determining how to visualize the charge density, we are guided by our perception of the electrons as a diffuse cloud around and between the atomic nuclei. Following the procedure described by Farrell and Christidis[S], we construct an image of the volume containing the charge density data. Each data sample in the volume is represented by a translucent, luminescent voxel whose light absorbing and emitting properties are related to the charge density value.</p><p>We assume that the lighting effect of those optical properties is described by Beer's Law with emission, viz.</p><p>where / is the intensity of a particular color along our line of sight. .Y is distance along the line of sight, K is the absorption coefficient, and E is the color emissivity. The above equation represents a simplification over that normally seen for optical modelling of physical media, because we are dealing with the visualization of numbers and we are limiting our imaging to non-perspective views. Thus, we have omitted mass density and differentials of surface area and solid angle normally included in Beer's Law. To integrate this equation over our data space, we treat each section of data samples as a slab of material whose K and E are constant along the line of sight. Then, we find</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">/(A\) = /(0)rpKA' + ( I -</formula><p>where AV is the slab thickness along the line of sight. To extend the integration over the whole data volume, we apply this formula successively over all the d d b sections, operating from back to front. The result [(AY) out of one iteration becomes /(0) into the next. This equation is similar to that used by <ref type="bibr">Russell and Miles[6]</ref>, except that they consider a single quantity in place of E/K. The significance of the denominator K becomes apparent later.</p><p>Now, a popular method of combining multiple images is to use the Porter and Duff[7] image compositing algorithms. We show that with the proper interpretation of the inputs, our formulation is functionally equivalent to the Porter and Duff foreground over background merge, as follows. They define attenuation factors a~ and an and "premultiplied" colors (', and c '~ for foreground and background images, respectively, and they obtain a composite by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(' = cF + ( 1 -aF)(B a = aF. + ( 1 -a,)a,.</formula><p>Their premultiplied color is the actual color (red, green, or blue) multiplied by the corresponding a. We see that In terms of our formulation, their equation for a is simply a statement of the exponential relationship between and K. That is, as we successively add data sections in our image construction, the current section corresponds to the foreground, the background is the composite of prior sections, and a8 is their composite attenuation, corresponding to summing KAX over the prior sections in the exponential.</p><p>Thus, we have espressed the Porter and Duff algorithm, originally derived for artistic costruction, in the context of a physical model characterized by Beer's Law. We have done this to make use of the merge algorithm with optical parameters based on physical processes rather than on artistic construction. In experimenting with the optical parameters during image costruction, we find it easier to anticipate the effect of a parameter adjustment if it is physically based; hence we can arrive at a meaningful display more quickly. In particular, our specification of the scaled color ct is dependent upon our choice for aF both directly and indirectly through K. For example, when at is small, a p~, and we can interpret cF as just E. This case corresponds to a nearly transparent, glowing gas. When at -) 1, then K -+ -, but if we exercise our freedom to choose EKK, we can interpret G = E / K to be the (finite) surface color of an opaque (at = 1) slab. This case corresponds physically to an opaque bar of iron that is so hot that it glows. For intermediate at, we must think of ct as an emission scaled by ~F / K , rather than by a~ as suggested by Porter and Duffs premultiplication.</p><p>We can specify the color and attenuation as functions of the data values by defining several intervals of data value, over each of which the color and attenuation vary linearly. For data values outside all of the selected intervals, we set a small attenuation with no color to effect a depth shading in the resulting image. Our strategy is to select data intervals so that meaningful features are delineated, subtle variations of data value within the features are highlighted, and a fair portion of the data values are excluded from display to prevent obscuration of the interesting features. Within each selected data interval, we can set at each end the attenuation and the hue, lightness, and saturation of the color. Those parameters vary linearly between the endpoints in each interval. Although the number of parameters we can adjust may seem formidable, the relative speed with which we can render a translucent image (about one to two minutes on a workstation) allows us to conduct a fair amount of experimentation and arrive at a good combination reasonably quickly.</p><p>Initially, we concentrated on finding a data interval that would show the bonding structure. We found that we could more readily distinguish the low end of the interval from the high end if we set a relatively high attenuation and dim color at the low end and a low attenuation and brighter color at the high end. Our settings, along with those for the other intervals, are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Next, we sought an interval which would reveal how the local maximum in charge density is distributed within each bond and how it varies in strength from case to case. This interval is the green range in The nuclear configuration can be visualized with the charge density by graphically overlaying 3D fiducial marks in the density display at the nuclear positions. We effect the overlay by imbedding the marks in the data so that they appear properly imbedded in the displayed 3D density field.</p><p>The use of our display parameters can be illustrated by rendering in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> the charge density for bulk (pure) silicon. The figure is a stereoscopic pair formed by rendering two views separated by six degrees around the screen vertical axis. The image pair can be examined with the aid of commercially available stereoscopic viewers. The figure shows a 217x217~129 subvolume of 20 silicon atoms within the crystal lattice. The bonding structure is quite apparent in the figure. The orange tends to outline the bond charge region in the fashion of an isodensity surface; we have effectively imaged a "fuzzy surface." The brightest orange is contained in the innermost part of each bond outline, and the outer skin is grayish, consistent with our color settings for the lower end of the charge density range. Thus, it is apparent that the bond charge density increases inward. Also, the gray skin extends over the bond junctures, revealing that the charge density there remains lower. We adjusted the orange translucency so that the imbedded green would show through clearly. There is indeed a distinct gap between the orange and green, consistent with the gap in our selected data intervals. The green serves as an isodensity surface because of our selection of optical parameters in that range. Our imbedded graphics for the nuclear centers are apparent as white 3D crosses ("jacks") at the junctures of the bonds. Our selection of a slight  attenuation for data values outside the feature ranges is evident by the appearance of the voided regions as a smoke-filled room. This effective haze tends to accentuate the depth in the volume by darkening the deeper features and by producing a silhouette against the white background.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Data Visual Interpretation</head><p>Our previous way of visualizing the 3D charge density field involved making 2D contour plots of the density on selected planes <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. For example, to visualize the corrugated hexagonal structure in <ref type="figure">Figure I</ref> , we would need to generate contours on multiple planes to capture the midsections of all six bonds in the structure, since the bonds are not coplanar. In contrast, we can see the complete structure in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>The relatively large volume in the figure is effective in portraying the overall structure of crystalline silicon; however, to concentrate on a more interesting interior region, we extract a 169x169~97 subvolume from the volume in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, and we display in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> a corner view of the subvolume. To avoid interference from data near the leading comer, we have truncated the comer by masking out the data values in a small tetrahedral volume there. However, we have retained one of the jacks that mark the silicon nuclei for the sake of reference.</p><p>We have added two more jacks near the center of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> to denote several representative positions of an oxygen atom. If we place an oxygen atom near the left jack and compute the relaxation configuration from QMD, the oxygen nucleus settles at the position marked by that jack, and we obtain the charge density field shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>. It is apparent that there is a single blue region which surrounds the oxygen atom, where the charge density reaches maximum. Thin layers of green and orange surround the blue, but the blue shows through well. The figure indicates that the oxygen atom has formed a bridge of charge concentration between two silicon atoms. We refer to this minimum energy or equilibrium state as the bridge configuration. Comparing <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>, we see that the charge density has increased in a number of the bonds in the bridge configuration, as evident by the enlarged green regions. It is also apparent that the silicon-silicon (covalent) bonds to the left and right of the oxygen bridge are not coplanar with the bridge, whereas the corresponding three bonds in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> are coplanar. As a result, a contour plot in the plane spanned by the undistorted bonds misses the distorted bond midsections, instead showing contours on  in the color plates, wherein a closeup. monoscopic image is included for detailed examination. The lighter, spheroidal form is high charge density surrounding the oxygen nucleus. This region (blue in the color plates) represents charge density above 215. Notice the disappearance of the covalent (silicon-silicon) bond where the oxygen bridge appears and the expansion of the dark (174.215) regions in several of the bonds, denoting charge enhancement in those bonds.</p><p>lower density sections away from the bond centers. Hence, a cursory examination of 2D contours would mislead one to conclude erroneously that the charge density decreases in the bonds when the oxygen is present. Therefore, 3D visualization is essential to our correct understanding of the charge density characteristics.</p><p>We are interested in determining how an oxygen atom might undergo a transition from one bridge position to an adjacent one, as a step in its migration through a silicon crystal. To carry out that transition, the oxygen atom must overcome a potential barrier or local energy maximum located between the two bridge positions, in fact at the right oxygen jack in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> under static conditions (all nuclei at rest). To evaluate the barrier under those conditions, we placed an oxygen atom near the right oxygen jack in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> and again performed the QMD computations to effect relaxation. In this case we constrained the oxygen atom so that it could not move horizontally left or right, a condition necessitated by the fact that the energy falls in those directions, away from the barrier. The oxygen nucleus settled at the position marked by the jack, and we obtained the charge density shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>, where again the leading comer is truncated for better visibility. Since the oxygen atom settles at the minimum energy within the constraints. yet the energy falls in either horizontal direction away from the jack, this case is called the saddle configuration. By symmetry, the oxygen atom, the three adjacent silicon atoms, and the silicon atoms at the lower left and upper right edges of the volume all lie on the same plane. The weakening or disappearance of bonds in that plane is readily apparent, as it was in earlier contour plots in that plane. However, the widespread charge enhancement in bonds out of that plane, as clearly evident in the figure, previously eluded US.</p><p>We discovered that the most effective way to identify differences in the charge density displays was to alternately refresh the screen with any two of the images to effect a "blink comparison." Stereoscopic blink comparison was instrumental in identifying subtle geometric and color changes between all the various equilibrium configurations, as well as refining the distinctions in the more obvious changes.</p><p>Because the oxygen atom and perhaps the silicon nuclei are in motion during the migration, the assumption of static conditions might not be valid in evaluating the barrier. Therefore, as a second step we performed sets of QMD computations to track the motion of the oxygen and silicon atoms after imparting initial velocities to the oxygen atom to propel it out of the bridge position. From  the resulting motion, we could determine whether or not the oxygen atom was successful in reaching another bridge configuration, hence what initial velocity imparts enough kinetic energy to overcome the barrier. In this way we found that the barrier potential is considerably higher than in the static case but that it agrees well with independent experimentation. Once the oxygen atom is over the barrier, it is necessary to simulate energy dissipation to cause the oxygen atom to fall into a new bridge state. We made animation sequences of the charge density images for initial oxygen velocities above and below the threshold value for overcoming the barrier. Selected snapshots of the above-threshold sequence are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>. The sequence reveals a dramatic interaction between the moving oxygen and the upper-right silicon bond assembly in its path, resembling a ball bouncing off a rubber net. As the oxygen atom reverses direction, the silicon nucleus and its bonds recoil. During the oxygen's traversal, the charge density in the top-central and rightcentral bonds change significantly. As the oxygen atom settles into its final resting place, a protrusion grows to the right of the silicon atom that lies on the right side of the initial oxygen bridge. That protrusion is a dangling bond that we had anticipated but were unable to see previously. Finally, we consider visualization when two oxygen atoms cluster in the silicon crystal. Several configurations are compared in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref>. To compare with single oxygen results, we include another one-oxygen bridge case equivalent to our earlier one. In this case the oxygen nucleus lies on the outside of the displayed silicon hexagon, in contrast to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>. We add a second oxygen atom inside the hexagon near the right bond adjacent to the first oxygen bridge and perform QMD relaxation to obtain the second charge density in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref>. Except for some charge enhancement, the silicon covalent bonds in this case differ relatively little from the single oxygen case. Now, when we perform the QMD relaxation with the second oxygen atom exterior to the silicon bond ring, we obtain the third charge density in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref>. The silicon structure has changed considerably. Covalent bonds on either side of the oxygen pair have vanished, and the hexagonal bond ring has now become pentagonal. The ease with which we can visualize this restructuring dramatically illustrates the advantage of 3D rendering over previous 2D contouring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Presentation Methods</head><p>We performed most of our analysis with stereoscopic visualization. We also experimented with rotation to enhance the depth through motion parallax, but we found the effort in following the moving features to be somewhat distracting. On the other hand, if we demonstrate blink comparison by playing a videotape, the nature of that medium encourages us to include motion parallax as a substitute for stereoscopy. In fact, we use both methods in presenting our results. The stereoscopic presentation consists of projection of slide pairs with polarizing filters and polarized glasses worn by the audience. We demonstrate depth enhanced blink comparison by use of a videotape in which we have interlaced alternating seg-  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>, except that the oxygen atom now lies outside the silicon hexagon. Middle: A second oxygen atom is added inside the silicon hexagon. Note how similar this case appears to the single oxygen configuration on the left. Right: The second oxw e n atom is added outside the silicon ring, The ring, hexagonal in all the previous figures, has become pentagonal 1 0</p><p>with the sixth silicon atom isolated in front of the oxygen pair.</p><p>ments from rotation sequences of two different oxygen configurations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>Visualization, through volumetric rendering of the 3D electronic charge density computed from molecular structure simulation, provides a valuable tool for extracting meaning from the computation results. Interactive 3D imaging helps to gain physical insight sometimes missed in the use of 2D visualization alone. Even when we were able to draw the correct conclusions from our 2D interpretations, we found that the 3D visualization brought us to those conclusions much more quickly, and we expect this form of visualization to accelerate our future analysis efforts.</p><p>Stereoscopic blink comparison is an extremely useful tool for visualizing changes in 3D data. When combined with rotation, blink comparison provides an effective means of conveying that information to others, even without the benefit of stereoscopy. During analysis. stereoscopic examination of still pictures is generally preferable to using rotation without stereoscopy.</p><p>The use of 3D visualization for communicating our results to our peers is invaluable. A significant gain in communication is realized by stereoscopic presentation, even with only the modest display technology manifested in stereoscopic slide projection. However. if stereoscopy is not possible, as perhaps when showing a videotape of blink comparisons or time animations, slow rotation should be included for its benefit in depth perception.</p><p>The success of our volumetric rendering and the 3D visualization technique in facilitating our analysis suggests that these techniques should be useful to many other branches of physics and engineering where 3D fields are computed. We are encouraging our physics colleagues to pursue that venture. Ultimately, the value of scientific visualization techniques will be measured by the extent and frequency of their successful use. We feel that basing the display color and attenuation characteristics on a physical model moves our system in the direction of greater usability, but we continue to seek refinements in our parameter specifications that will move it even further in that direction.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>our formulation based on Beer's Law is functionally equivalent to the Porter and Duff merge algorithm if we identify c with /(AI-) and c '~ with I(0) and define I</figDesc></figure>

For stereoscopic viewing, hold a card vertically between the images and stare at them so that the left eye sees only the left image and the right eye sees only the right image, or use a commercially available stereoscopic viewer.</figDesc></figure>
