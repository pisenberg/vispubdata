				<p>There is an increasing interest in visualizing 4-0 ultrasound data for use in medical diagnosis. This paper discusses different standard rendering methods applied to 4-0 medical ultrasound data. In particular we have tested maximum value projection, sum of values projection, transparent gray level gradient shading, and surface shading. Due to the fact that ultrasound data suffer from a low signal to noise ratio issues such as image processing and image analysis are used with the purpose to enhance and classify the volumetric data set.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Early ultrasound systems recorded the time variations along a single I-D line. This measurement principle is now called M-MODE and is still available in ultrasound systems because of the superior time-resolution. The ability to change the direction of the ultrasound beam inside a plane made it possible to produce time varying 2-D ultrasound images. A typical data rate in modem ultrasound scanners is 50 images per second. Each image will typically have a resolution of 512 by 128 pixels.</p><p>A major application in medical ultrasound imaging is the study of the cardiac function. This study requires the evaluation of motion properties of a three dimensional structure. This structure must currently be estimated on the basis of a very low number of intersecting scanplanes. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the geometrical model of the cardiac function would improve if it was possible to change the direction of the ultrasound beam freely inside a cone or a pyramid. The data samples could in this case be used to reconstruct a time dependent volumetric representation. The spatial resolution is nevertheless bound to be a critical factor because of the limitations imposed by the speed of sound in tissue/water. If the sampling region has a certain depth, then there will be a minimal time delay that is required for transmittal and receival of a single Bj@m Olstad Norwegian Institute of Technology <ref type="bibr">NORWAY</ref> beam. If one fixes the framerate of the imaging system, there will hence be a maximal number of beams available for sampling of a 3-D spatial region. The spatial resolution can be increased by using multiple beams, but interference problems restrict the potential of such parallel processing.</p><p>Ra" at Duke University has constructed a prototype scanner that samples the 3-D scene with 15 frames per second [9]. This scanner processes 16 ultrasound beams in parallel, but the spatial resolution is still poor compared to traditional 2-D imaging.</p><p>Time varying geometrical models of the cardiac function can also be obtained by integrating the information in a set of coregistered scanplanes. <ref type="bibr">King et. al. [5]</ref> have developed equipment that can be used for 3-D coregistering of independent 2-D measurements. Ultrasound probes have also been designed which measure several 2-D scanplanes simultaneously.</p><p>Classification of tissues is part of the reason for the success in volume rendering of magnetic resonance images (MRI) reported by <ref type="bibr">Drebin et al.</ref> [ 11. They use the classified volumes both as a basis for colour coding of the tissues, and for detecting surfaces. Adding surfaces with shades is known to give valuable depth information for understanding the geometry of the data.</p><p>Classification of ultrasound data is difficult because the quality of the data is deteriorated by a number of factors. In particular the presence of Gaussian noise with a high correlation in space and a relatively low-resolution sampling make data analysis difficult. Furthermore, variations in the density within a specific tissue also make classification hard. The problems here are to distinguish between Gaussian noise and changing physiological properties, e.g. muscles with varying tension. The reflected value of tissues may also vary as the manual compensation for depth (the gain of the beam can be changed) is adjusted and image drop out appears (contrast deterioration). Reverberations in ultrasound data is also a problem for both visual interpretation and automatic tissue classification. These issues are discussed in <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data Acquisition</head><p>Contrary to CT and MRI which provide time sequences of volume data (slices are stacked to form a volume) [6], the ultrasound scanner which we used collects time sequences of 2-D images as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. The two dimensional images are produced by a fast sweep of an ultrasound beam, covering part of a plane in space. One such sweep produces 64 (or 128) digital density functions (arrays), and has a duration of 1/46'th of a second. The scanner is therefore capable of producing 46 images (frames) pr. second. Since the ultrasound scanning equipment available to us could only provide a time sequence of 2-D images, the time sequence of 3-D data was acquired manually.</p><p>Schemritic drawing of how we manually acquired three dimensional ultrasound data using a two dimensional scanner.</p><p>To obtain a time sequence of 3-D data of the human heart the ultrasound scanner was manually tilted through an angle of 45 degrees as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Eight time sequences of 2-D images of the heart were acquired at equally separated scan planes as visualized in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. A total of 29 time frames from each scan plane were used to reconstruct the 4-D data set. The first frame in each of the eight time sequences was captured at start-diastole and used to register the image sequences from the different scan planes as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Volume Reconstruction</head><p>Given the eight time sequences of ultrasound images as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4.,</ref> acquired along the scan planes as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>., a scan conversion into regular volumes was needed. Corresponding frames from each of the eight time sequences were placed into a regular volume (cube) as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5</ref>. To fill in the empty voxels in hotween the eight frames a linear interpolation along the 45 arc span was done. A total of 29 volumes were reconstructed in this way. This provided us with a time sequence of regular ultrasound volume data where the voxel values in the volumes represent a density of the scanned material (the heart in our case). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 6</ref>. shows two slices of a reconstructed volume.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Left ventricle</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Rendering Methods</head><p>Four different rendering methods were tested on 4-D Linear interpolation along the arcs to fill in the empty voxels in Y t z  Two slices of one of the reconsmcted ultrasound volultrasound data sets. Some ot the rendered greyscale images are shown in this paper, but the major result is shown as time sequences in the accompanying videos (video A and video B). Common to three of the methods is the ray-tracing technique that was used to render the volumes. For each pixel in the image to be rendered a ray was traced from the current user view point and into the volume. As the ray proceeds through the volume it takes ailinearly interpolated samples.</p><p>Depending on the applied rendering method a median filter [4] was applied on each of the 2-D ultrasound images before doing the scan conversion, to reduce noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Maximum value projection</head><p>The maximum value projection is a rendering method which simply displays the highest value encountered along a ray. This method was first tested on the original intensity volume data set. Then, the same rendering method was used but instead of displaying the maximum intensity along a ray the maximum central-difference value [6] along a ray was wlayed.</p><p>When rendering volume data using this method the 3-D structure of the data will only be apparent to the user when the rendered volumes are shown as a time sequence. This is because the information in a single rendered image is comparable to that of an X-ray image. A sample of such a time sequence is shown on the accompanying video (video A) both for the projection of maximum intensity and the maximum central-difference value. Grey level images are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9. and Fig. 10</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Sum of values projection</head><p>In addition to the maximum value projection rendering method described above, a density value algorithm was also used. This algorithm steps along each ray through the volume and accumulates a weighted average of the values along the ray. This method was tested on the original intensity volume.</p><p>Contrary to the maximum value projection method, no apparent three dimensional structure is visible even when a time sequence is shown. One time sequence of this method appears on video A. A grey level image is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 11</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Grey level gradient shading</head><p>A gray level gradient shading method <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref> was also applied to the volume data set. A time sequence is shown on video A, visualizing the complete volume. <ref type="figure">Fig. 12</ref>. shows a grey level image of this method.</p><p>For each pixel in the rendered image, this method spawns a ray from the current user viewpoint which traverses the volume. As the ray proceeds through the volume, trilinearly interpolated samples are compared with a user specified substance classification table. If the ray traverses a boundary between two substances, a surface normal is calculated, from a central-difference-based gradient, and a Lambertian shading model is applied <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. The colour obtained from the shading model is summed into the ray depending on both the number of voxels of the substance which the ray traverses and on the user specified opacity and colour for the different substances.</p><p>A simple classification scheme, based directly on the intensity values, was applied to the volume. Contrary to Drebin et. al. a none-or-all decision about which material is present in a voxel is done. With the assumption that the ultrasound data volume consisted of only three different substances this classification scheme did not introduce any visible artifacts. The volumes were classified according to the graphs shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Surface visualization of the heart wall</head><p>A methodology for extracting 4-D geometrical models from a set of 2-D image sequences is described in   <ref type="figure">Fig. 13</ref>. End-Systole is the period in time when the left ventricle is contracted and has a minimal volume. End-Diastole represents the dilated version of the ventricle with a maximal volume.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>Four different standard visualization methods have been tested on 4-D medical ultrasound data (where time is the fourth dimension). Our goal was to identify any addi- uonal vlsual insight provided by an mspecuon ot a ume sequence of 3-D ultrasound data compared to a 2-D sequence. It was our experience that three of the methods seems successful in achieving this goal.</p><p>The ability for the sum of valuesprojection method (section 4.2) to reflect the 3-D structure of the heart is poor both for static views and time sequences. The Maximum intensity projection method (section 4.1) showed promising results when a time sequence was visualized. The 3-D structure of the heart is clearly perceived. The same is true for the grey level gradient shading method (section 4.3).</p><p>Medical ultrasound data is used to extract both qualitative and quantitative information. The rendering methods tested in section 4.1 and 4.3, generate qualitative information about the global geometry. There is nevertheless no geometrical model associated with these techniques and quantitative information must still be extracted from the original data set.</p><p>The surface visualization described in section 4.4 is based on a geometrical model. The model can therefore also be used for efficient computation of quantitative, physiological parameters. This technique is therefore very appealing and the accompanying visualization are easily interpreted. The extraction of the geometrical model is nevertheless a critical factor. It will be difficult to construct reliable real-time edge-detectors for volumetric ultrasound data and it will still be necessary to verify the geometrical models with the original volumemc data set.</p><p>The experiments indicate that the 3-D registration equipment reported in [5] could be replaced by a low-remlution 3-D rendering, A conventional high-resolution 2-D image sequence could be visualized together with the position of the scanplane superimposed on a low-resolution 3-D rendering. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>CH3046- 0 /Fig. 1 .</head><label>01</label><figDesc>91/0000/02iOt$Ol .OO (D 1991 IEEE A Fig. Schematic drawing of the ultrasound .warming equipment which was used to provide data for the experiments presented in this paper. The two dimensional ultrasound image shown is one of many frames which are grabbed at a frame rate of 30 to 50 per second. Each frame represents the current two dimensional scan plane of the ultrasound scanner. In this paper we address the problem of visualizing 4-D medical ultrasound data (where the fourth dimension is time). Several standard rendering methods are tested on a 4-D ultrasound data set of the human heart. Filtering algorithms such as the median and mean are used on the data set to reduce speckle which is characteristic for ultrasound data. A simple scheme is used to classify tissue, heart muscle, and blood/&amp;. If time varying 3-D ultrasound data increase the clinical value of medical ulmsound imaging the development of real-time 3-D ultrasound scanners are of great interest. It is therefore important to identify any qualitative improvement provided by a visual inspection of a time sequence of 3-D ultrasound data compared to a 2-D sequence.</figDesc></figure>
