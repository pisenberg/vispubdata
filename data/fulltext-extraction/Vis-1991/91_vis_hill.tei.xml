<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Graphic excellence is beginning a process of redefinition to accommodate computational graphics. In this process, the accepted wisdom of what tools and skills are required to produce visualization excellence is itself undergoing redefinition in order to incorporate, among other changes, new deictic facilities. These facilities are enabled for the first time by the controlled dynamics that computational graphics offer. The facilities will be in demand because they will allow users to express complex task-specific pointing intentions. To the degree visualization techniques mature and spread, we expect effective deixis to acquire the stature of obligatory functionalitypresumed by advancing ideas of graphic excellence. In linguistics, deictic reference refers to use of words like "here" which must be accompanied by a pointing gesture. And in general, deixis is pointing, that is, directing visual attention by whatever means are at hand. So pointing with your index finger is deixis but also just turning your head to look can function deictically if it directs the visual attention of others. Using a laser-pointer during a presentation is deixis. So is explaining travel directions with maps over the phone by verbally directing the visual attention of another to specific map locations. Theatrical lighting is another form of deixis. For example, the synchronous dimming of one spotlight and brightening of another serves to direct audience attention. So too, the many and varied ways film directors direct visual attention around movie scenes are examples of deixis. In giving a demonstration of a computer program it is common to use the mouse cursor to direct the viewers' visual attention. This too is an example of deixis. As should be clear, deictic mechanisms vary widely and are often central to effective communication.</p><p>In the realm of visualization, the narrative use of graphics almost always involves pointing. Good visualizations, for example, are rich with the interplay of beautiful and subtle deixis. Choices of lighting, material, highlights, textures, point of view, size, transparency, cutouts, arrows, blur, eye-catching movement, time dilation, edge-pushing, burnout, to name only a few, are mechanisms that can be employed to direct visual attention. Because visualization offers such great power of graphic transformation, it offers new vistas of expressing pointing intentions unavailable in other media.</p><p>But not every use of graphic technique is deictic. Otherwise deixis would mean nothing more than graphic technique. Although most graphic techniques may be employed deictically, in any given image only a few serve deictic intent. Only if you can remove the deixis and still have the image do you have deixis. This is the hallmark of deixis. Deixis is separable, removable, and temporary. Thus, in practice, on separate occasions, a presenter, having conceived particular communicative purposes relevant to distinct audiences, will point at the same image in different ways tailored to those purposes.</p><p>Why organize such varied communication behaviors under the label of deixis and raise it as a visualization issue? We offer four justifications for recommending the concept as an important visualization issue. First, by labeling it we attract attention to phenomena we believe are not sufficiently appreciated in the visualization community. Second, the varied phenomena that deixis names share more in common than a cursory examination reveals and we want to examine those commonalities. Third, as it becomes more common for people to coordinate their work with complex computed images, deictic problems and opportunities will spread and intensify, making effective deixis a significant issue, perhaps even a critical issue. Fourth, and most important to this discussion, in the context of computed images, the concept calls attention to the possibility of transforming images for deictic purposes, reifying those purposes in versions of the images. This fourth point, since it bears directly on the relation of deixis and visualization, deserves elaboration.</p><p>Pointing at graphics during narrative presentations is nothing new. It is the way people communicate. Neither is employing the tools of painterly and graphic composition to direct attention new. It is the tradition of art. Nevertheless, with respect to directing visual attention, visualization extends beyond traditional graphics use and artistic means in three important ways. First, in the past image copies were too expensive or simply unavailable for modifications that would express pointing intentions. But with computation as a resource, one can reify complex pointing intentions in enhanced versions of images without losing the original images. Thus, other pointing intentions may be readily added at other times. Second, traditionally, pointing behavior has been ephemeral and epiphenomenalpointing ut the image but not pointing in the image. Computational graphics makes possible a variety of new dynamic deictic mechanisms that can accompany the enhanced images as they pass through telecommunications channels or are recorded for other purposes. And, third, in previous graphic technologies, only the image creator had the power of employing complex and subtle pointing techniques. In the new case of interactive visualization, viewers themselves are empowered to point. This is of potentially vast importance to a host of telecommunication and computer-supported cooperative work applications.</p><p>To summarize, visualization affords three properties that transcend the properties of tradition graphic media, redefining the possible: (1) reified but removable pointing; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> pointing that goes where the image goes; and (3) viewer pointing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Deixis Is Fundamental To Visualizat io n</head><p>We present two arguments that deixis is fundamental to visualization. The first stems from the specific nature of visualization as a form of demonstration and the second follows from observable regularities in the social use of graphics. We examine the nature of visualization by contrasting it with demonstration by proof and derive a working definition of visualization.</p><p>We then consider the social use of graphics in more detail. Our goal in both cases is to persuade you that deixis is an unavoidable aspect of visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Argument From The Nature Of Visua h a t ion</head><p>Like proof, visualization is a form of demonstration. However, unlike proof techniques which offer incontrovertible results by deduction, visualization techniques offer intuitively comprehensible results via rerepresentation, in a phrase, "making the invisible visible" <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>. This re-representation of otherwise abstract information via perceptually effective representations is the mark of useful visualization.</p><p>Visualization is particularly valuable in assisting the understanding of phenomena that do not yield readily to proof techniques. Unlike proof, which requires its subject matter to be divided neatly into small separable packages of meaning (i.e., formulas, conjectures, theorems), visualization is of particular value for subject matter in which the interrelationships of large aggregates of separable facts are required to elicit the desired understanding. For these areas, such as architecture, ecology, geology, product design, medical imaging, fluid dynamics, and complex process control to name a few, one is frequently concerned with thousands of interrelationships simultaneously. Analysis and abstraction alone are often unworkable and unsatisfying strategies. Synthesis and concretization are required to render multitudes of concurrent interrelationships comprehensible. This definition of visualization is interesting in that it poses problems that visualizations must solve to be effective: the mapping problem, the seduction problem, and the emphasis problem. First, casting visualization as re-representation yields the mapping problem: what correspondences between facts and visual appearances will our visualization assert and why? Second, requiring visualizations to be intuitively comprehended raises the seduction problem: Does our visualization unwittingly engage the powerful pre-attentive aspects of human vision for trivial ends? Third, focusing visualization upon interrelationships among large aggregates of separable facts forces the emphasis problem: of all the portrayed interrelationships, which should we emphasize and what techniques should we employ to effect the emphasis?</p><p>These three problems are unavoidable. And it is on the basis of the unavoidability of the emphasis problem, that we claim deixis is fundamental to visualization. Consider the necessity of having a point of view. Since even the most elemental requirement for a point of view renders some aspects of the scene central and others peripheral, decisions of emphasis, even if only in the extremely simple form of presence and absence, are unavoidable. Like point of view decisions, virtually all graphical decisions have implications for directing visual attention. Thus, to visualize is to be immediately engaged in deixis. But there is another argument for deixis being fundamental to visualization. This argument is empirical and concerns observations lUse of the term "facts" here is meant to include numerical data as in "The angle of the wing is 30 degrees" and nonnumerical assertions such as "The walls are green." of graphical use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Argument From The Social Nature Of Graphics</head><p>Rarely are graphics employed for strictly private individual purposes. More commonly, through meetings, presentations, publications, and mass media, graphics are employed as social instruments, shared among individuals and groups. The social use of graphics is the norm.</p><p>It is an empirical fact that the social use of graphics relies heavily on pointing behaviors, those behaviors that direct visual attention by whatever means available toward salient aspects of graphics, often in coordination with speech or text. The paradigmatic example is a presenter pointing at presentation graphics before a live audience but there are many other social situations where graphics serve as shared interactionorganizing artifacts. Visualizations are such social graphics and as expected, if you just look, the amount of pointing by hand, mouse and cursor, narrative reference, and embedded visual technique during their use is enormous. Thus, from an empirical point of view, deixis is fundamental to visualization.</p><p>For understanding the existing practice of pointing as the ground upon which to build more effective deictic facilities, three observations are paramount. First, pointing behaviors commonly realize intents more complex than "look here". By analyzing pointing performances captured on videotape we have produced a preliminary taxonomy of such complex pointing intents. Because pointing behaviors realize complex intents, the simplistic assertion that a mouse and cursor handle the majority of interactive pointing needs is suspect. Second, graphical resources for pointing differ according to medium and situation. This amounts to saying we should expect and prepare for task-specific pointing techniques. We provide examples below of such techniques. Third, by reifying pointing behaviors and bringing them into the graphics themselves, computational techniques radically alter what pointing can be.</p><p>Thus, because the social use of graphics is the major use of graphics, because all social communication relies heavily on pointing, and because complex deictic intents can now be realized via computation, deixis is fundamental to visualization. Extrapolating from this thesis that deixis is fundamental to visualization, we arrive at the main point of this paper: effective deixis is essential to visualization excellence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Effective Deixis</head><p>Our analysis of what makes for effective deixis converges from consideration of two questions: <ref type="formula">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">What Is Needed: A Preliminary Taxonomy Of Pointing Intentions</head><p>We have already mentioned that social use of graphics relies heavily on pointing behavior, but not just to simply direct attention. Often it does much more. When one looks carefully at pointing behaviors, one can see a host of complex intents. By complex intent, we mean behaviors that communicate more than just "look here." Usually they combine no more than two or three requests for viewers to shape their visual processing (e.g., "look at these two lengths and compare"). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref> shows an example of an complex pointing gesture from our video analysis. Using middle finger and thumb to point out the ends of an vertical interval , the presenter is requesting that viewers regard the interval in context of a subsuming interval in the image, comparing them for placement and size.</p><p>Below is a list of twelve pointing gestures that we have observed in a analysis of videotapes of presenters referring to graphics. They provide a feel for the range of intents that deictic gestures are used to communicate: 0 difference (arrow shape typesstraight and Wiggly) 0 pinching (thumb and index finger dosing) 0 above/below (two-handed pointing, palms horizontal one above the other below)</p><p>For each behavior we have at least one and often multiple vignettes. By no means is our analysis complete.</p><p>We have not sampled widely but the range of complex pointing intents that are obvious from our initial analysis is sufficient to make our case.</p><p>It should be clear that in the case of computational graphics many of these pointing intentions are not well-served by a single mouse cursor. More complex visual techniques are required to express even these intents. In addition the pointing intents may also be composite in task-specific ways. We turn to two examples to demonstrate this.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">What works: Task-Specific Deixis</head><p>Our first example demonstrates the use of deixis to solve a common graphic interface problem, visually acquiring a lost cursor. After not using the mouse cursor for some time, one can loose track of its location. The solution consists of the composition of four pointing intents: (1) direct visual attention to where the cursor is; (2) help the user visually acquire the cursor object;</p><p>(3) once the cursor has been acquired, stop the now extraneous attention-attracting pointing behavior; and (4) do nothing to contribute to the user losing the cursor between steps (3) and (4). Our solution employs movement of contrasting luminences to direct attention to where the unseen cursor lies; size to make the cursor more acquirable and an animation transitioning back to the normal cursor state of affairs so as not to lose the cursor. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> shows the screen with the lost cursor and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> illustrates the cursor finding technique.</p><p>Our second, more complex example concerns the vi- sualization of switched-telephone network activity, in particular the performance of digital signals on fiber optic cables connecting mobile telephone transceiver sites to a central telephone switching office. These digital signals run at 45 Mb/second but are subject to transient errors Of various typeS. Special monitoring hardware collects error data so that performance can be examined to attempt to find predictive patterns.</p><p>ber of error parameters per signal, and the frequency of collection one frequently confronts an overwhelming volume of data. One such collection effort with which reference to absent graphic (gesture to former 'Oca-However, depending on the number of signals, num-we are involved collects over 100,000 error parameters per day.</p><p>We have built a visualization of these data for digital signal experts. They are interested in improving the quality of digital service so that one might be able to guarantee that transient errors will not occur more often than once in, say, lo-* clock cycles or some other suitably low level. The users of our visualization are concerned, among other things, with seeing error threshold breaking in the context of previous patterns of errors. That is to say, they want to see what is going on with the errors in periods preceding that in which particular thresholds are broken.</p><p>Their goal is to detect error signatures predictive of future threshold breaking. In terms of visualization, this means we wanted to direct their attention at the occurrence of threshold-breaking events but in a way that also highlights potentially relevant subthreshold error data. The visualization technique we developed serves as an an example of task-specific deixis. We refer to the pointing intention as "threshold-breaking in context". It consists of an animated rectilinear cityscape as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>. From left to right, days run within months through the year. From front to back, different signals are represented as strips through time. Five error parameters per signal per day are plotted as lit 3D rectangles. The user decides how large a moving window of days to display and the display animates through time, forward, back, or step by step showing errors for each system each day.</p><p>The threshold-breaking in context pointing intention is served by a variably-transparent movable neutral grey cutting plane to represent the current threshold as set by the user (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> and accompanying videotape). The transparent grey plane creates a contrast luminance between errors that exceed the threshold and those under the threshold. Within the dynamic scene, this creates a popout effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> in which the eye is effortlessly drawn specifically to the threshold-breaking errors. Transparency also handles the other part of the deictic intentionnot to occlude error activity under the threshold. Subthreshold activity can still be discerned and users can manipulate a transparency control to get more or less visual stimulation from subthreshold activity. Initial users of a prototype system have found this effective.</p><p>A small problem with the scheme caused us to add a refinement to assist with deixis. In the current prototype, one sees a window of errors for signals moving left to right through time. When many signals are displayed at once and the threshold is set high so that few errors break the threshold, users can miss threshold-breaking because they are attending too far away from the threshold-breaking event. The span of digital signal systems is too wide for visual attention to cover adequately and thus to take advantage of the automatic mechanisms that we invoke with changes in luminance.</p><p>In this case we use sound to assist with realizing our deictic intent. We attached a midi guitar note whose pitch is relative to error magnitude for each error that breaks threshold. With the addition of this technique every threshold breaking event is readily perceived. Many uses of sound in data visualization seem unmotivated, but this particular use well serves our deictic intentions and exploits a fundamental relationship between auditory and visual perception, namely that ears direct eyes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Demonstrations O f Deixis For Visualization</head><p>In a videotape that accompanies this paper, we provide short demonstration of cursor acquisition and threshold-breaking in context deixis. In addition, the videotape demonstrates other uses of deixis in visualization. This demonstration sequence moves around a 3D plane populated with a series of deictic examples.</p><p>These include spot-lighting <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 2)</ref> , frame-crossing, drawing, twinkling, and others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>The intent of this paper is to draw attention to the importance of deixis for the future of visualization excellence. In particular we focus on exploiting computational graphics to express composite task-specific pointing intentions. We argue that deixis is fundamental to visualization based on the nature of visualization and its social use, provide a working definition of visualization as the intuitively comprehensible re-representation of interrelationships among large aggregates of separable facts, highlight the problems of mapping, seduction, and emphasis, and begin to elaborate the requirements for effective deixis. In an accompanying video tape we provide demonstrations of task-specific deixis using movement, size, lighting, visual popout, and sound.</p><p>We see deixis as a rich area of visualization research with a number of challenging open problems. In addition to understandings of how to effectively exploit deictic facilities enabled by computation there are also interesting problems arising from new types of applications. In computer supported cooperative work applications for example, one confronts a set of deictic issues resulting from the existence of multiple points of view. More directly related to our research are deictic issues involved in creation of dynamic information interfaces. As interfaces start to become more dynamic and responsive to the structure of users' interaction, a variety of issues arise concerning how to effectively change the appearance and behavior of interface objects to reflect a complex set of pointing intents without unnecessarily distracting users from their tasks.            </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>&amp;k-sis\ n [Gk deixis reference] : indication, pointing out.
