				<p>The technique of placing directed line segments at grid points, known as hedgehogging, has been used for some time as a tool for visualizing two dimensional vector fields. We provide a means of rapidly rendering a slice of a three dimensional field, suitable for a bilevel display. Shape and shadowing are used to disambiguate orientation. Liberal use of lookup tables makes the technique very fast.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>This paper presents a fast method for producing a bi level image portraying field strength and three dimensional orientation. The image produced is suitable for a laser printer or bitmapped display. The method is appropriate for displaying a field that has been either measured or com puted, on a grid of moderate resolution (sizes greater than roughly 70x70 require larger format than the 6" normally used on a printed page). The method is appropriate for three dimensional vector fields, such as electromagnetic fields or flow fields; electric fields are used for illustrative purposes.</p><p>Two dimensional vector fields are commonly displayed using contour maps (of potential) or stream lines. Contour maps are good for displaying the gradient and direction of a field, but to read field strength from a contour map is more difficult. Streamlines give a more intuitive sense of field strength and direction, but the orientation information is lost where the lines are either too sparse or too dense.</p><p>Several recent approaches simulate in one way or another the effect of visualizing a magnetic field using iron filings on a sheet of paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Adding the extra information required to display orientation within a slice of a three dimensional field is difficult.</p><p>Hedgehogging has been used by Forrest <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and others as a means of displaying normal vector information at CH3046-0191/000010148I$Ol.00@ 1991 IEEE Display of slices of a field using hedge hogging is most effective on a fast graphics workstation. so that the entire slice can be rotated and translated in real time. In this way motion augments any other depth cues to give a clear impression of orientation in 3-space. To provide a similar level of information on paper. we introduce shadows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>148</head><p>This paper describes our technique for rapidly obtaining images of hedgehogging with shadows. It begins with a discussion of the requirements for readability. Once the desired image has been described, we show how to compute such an image efficiently. Finally, we discuss the relative merits of the method, and future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Readable hedgehogs</head><p>This section addresses issues of making the image read able, in the sense that no information is added (that the eye notices), and as much information is displayed as possible.</p><p>The size of an individual vector must be less than that of the grid spacing. <ref type="figure">Figure I</ref> shows the problems that can result if it is greater than the grid spacing. The size is  the distance of one grid space, lines should not be more than 112 of one grid space. We assume that the maximum field strength is known a priori, so that the vectors drawn can be scaled accordingly. If this is not known, a prep ass through the data is required.   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> shows the bulb case at a smaller scale. By varying the length of the line or wedge. some field intensity information can be encoded. Note that wedges must become narrower as they become shorter, so that the base is never longer than the height. Should the base become longer than the height, the perceived orientation is parallel to the base, rather than toward the tip. For lack of a better term, we shall call the bulb-headed representation a thermometer, since it resembles a mercury thermometer. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5</ref> shows the improvement gained by adding shadows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">---------------- ---------------- ---------------- ----------------</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">\ \ 149 � • " � r".-.-.... .. . ..-..-....-....-...-.... .. . - .. \ , r" .... . -..---..------- .... . .... .. ,--..-..-�.-...-..------.- ,I&gt; , \ '-.... .. . .... .. . .... .... .. _ .... .... . _ .... . .... . .- ,. , � .... ....

For vectors coming out of the plane of the page, we could draw the shadows as if there were a second light source shining toward the first, and the page were semi-transparent. In this case it would be unclear whether the thermometers point into or out of the plane. To remedy this, we displace them slightly from the plane of the page <ref type="figure">(Figure 6</ref>).

A compact but somewhat slow way to do this is to issue PostScript commands to draw the thermometers and their shadows as lines and circles. A much faster technique is to precompute raster images for the set of possible vectors and shadows. The table of these images is then indexed by orientation and length, and the appropriate image is copied to the display.</p><p>Our implementation of this technique can image a 32x32 array of thermometers and their shadows in less than .06 seconds on a Sun 4/260. The shadows are drawn first, so that vectors hide them wherever they overlap.</p></div>

Hedgehog gingtypically done with line segments originating on a surface and directed parallel to the vectors they portray is a three dimensional analog of an old technique. Edmund Halley used pen strokesshort dashes, thicker at one end and tapering to a point at the otherto show prevailing wind direction on a map of the world's oceans (3) (Halley's map is discussed in Tufte (7)). Short lines from each grid point have been used as well (6); line length was tied to field strength with reasonable results in regions of low field strength, less so in regions of high field strength, where the picture becomes cluttered. Lavin and Cherveney have used the density of line segments, rather than their length. to display the field intensity (5).</figDesc></figure>

It is much easier to see straight horizontal lines in an image like the one above, than to discern field orientation. This effect increases with image size. In order to disambiguate orientation. especially in re gions of uniform orientation and strength, the lines need some distinguishing feature at one end. Figure 3 shows three possibilities. According to Fowler and Ware [2], lines of varying width are more likely to be perceived as moving toward the larger end, regardless of shape.Figure 4shows one type at a smaller scale: at this size the directionality becomes more apparent.</figDesc></figure>

With three dimensional vectors, the orientation and length of the projection onto the plane of the page is clear, but both the length of the vector and the angle it makes with the plane of the page are unclear. Various approaches have been traditionally used in computer graphics to remove depth ambiguities. These include shading, depth cueing (in which objects closer to the viewer are shaded more brightly). and casting shadows. Of these, shading and depth cueing have heen shown to be the most effective on their own (two or more cues being more effective). For this application, neither of these is feasible. To maximize the amount of data on a page, we use vectors of maximum length on the order of 1/16". To provide meaningful depth cueing, we would need to provide roughly eight levels of grey, none of them too close to white. To get this many distinct levels of grey by haiftoning requires a sufficiently coarse screen that the lines would lose their shape. Hence, we use shadows to clarify the remaining components. Shadows are drawn in grey so that they are distinct from vectors. Bulb-headed vectors have the advantage that if the hulb is treated as a sphere, the shadow is the same shape as the vector. differing only in orientation and lengtht.</figDesc></figure>

The field orientation varies smoothly through all possible angles. Along the top and bottom it is coming out of the plane of the page; in between it rotates into the plane of the page and back. them. The displacement must be such that the shadows are near enough to their source thermometers to be easily associated, yet far enough distant that they are unlikely to overlap. We have two implementations: one for bit-mapped de vices, such a'i a screen or generic laser printer, and the other a PostScript® program. The PostScript program produces more compact output, so it is suitable for trans mission over a slow data line to a PostScript printer. Given a grid of vector values for a plane, the first step is to compute the projections of the vectors onto the plane and the shadows of the vectors' thermometer representations. This calculation is easily done by first transforming the plane of interest into the x-y plane -the projection of the vector is then just its x and y components (assuming it is viewed from the z direction).</figDesc></figure>

Because of the orthographic projection, the image of the thermometers is unaffected. The translation required is given by the shadow vector for a thermometer pointing directly into the plane</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_12"><head>1 �</head><label>1</label><figDesc>have described an algorithm for displaying slices of three dimensional fields on a bi-Ievel display. The algorithm is very fast, being limited by the speed with which BitBh operations can be performed. Vectors are represented as lines with filled circles at the head end. The presence of the circles eliminates ambiguity with respect to which end is the head. Depth is added by using shadows, leaving an ambiguity with respect to whether the vector points into or out of the plane. This last ambiguity is eliminated by displacing the plane of the vectors' representations from the plane of the page. Technically oriented observers tend to have no difficulty seeing the third dimension with the addition of shadows, once they are told how to interpret the image. It would be nice to have a method that needed no explanation. Figure 8 shows the utility of the algorithm in visualizing the field experienced by toner particles approaching an idealized photorecepter carrying an image of an X. At first viewing, images computed using our technique look like they need the addition of perspective. Two problems are introduced by the addition of perspective. First, we have already lost some of the magnitude infor• mation by showing only the projection onto the plane of the page. Some of this is regained through the magnitude of the shadow, but it is no longer possible to determine directly the ratio of the lengths of two vectors by looking at the image. Two components of the vector are preserved by the orthographic projection, so at least they can be � , , , , � , , , , .... , .... .... , , , \ \ \ , � , , , , .... .... , , \ , � ... ., ,,, , .... .... ,.... , '. .... .... .... , .... .... � , \ , 1 I I I I 1</figDesc></figure>
