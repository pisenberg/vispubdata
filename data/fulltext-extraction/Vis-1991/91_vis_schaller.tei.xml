<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>It is almost a platitude to say that the advancement of science depends on a blend of theoretical modeling and experimentation. A scientist may perform a physical experiment for the purpose of understanding behavior for which he wishes to build a theory, or for the purpose of verifying predictions that arise out of a model. However, only in recent years has the value of "thought experiments," as Einstein called them, been recognized as a tool for scientific discovery.</p><p>To illustrate the power of such reverse experimentation, consider the following passage from Einstein's Autobiographical Notes. In discussing the need to postulate that the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames of reference, he mentions a paradox that had already struck him at the age of sixteen:</p><p>"If I pursue a beam of light with the velocity (velocity of light in a vacuum), I should observe such a beam of light as a spatially oscillatory electromagnetic field at rest. However, there seems to be no such thin.g, whether on the basis of experience or according to . . . [the fundamental electromagnetic] equatioiis. From the very beginning it appeared to me intuiti,uely clear that, judged from the standpoint of s,uch an observer, everything would have to happen according to the same laws as f o r an observer who, relative to the earth, was at rest. )'</p><p>The conventional model of light propagation (for those times) gave a picture that to him was counterintuitive. What process was he going through? IIe was visualizing a situation derived from a theoretical model and testing it against his own insight and intuition. This is exactly the purpose of scientific visualization as a tool in scientific discovery. From a complex theoretical model, one develops a picture that distills the essence of the phenomenon being modeled. In this manner, one is able to push past formulae and figures to an intuitive view of the fundamental structure. This may improve one's understanding of the phenomenon or the model, it may also help one to validate the model, and it may allow one to make further imaginative leaps that would have been more difficult to reach from a purely mathematical formulation.</p><p>Scientific visualization, as a subfield of scientific computing, is a rapidly expanding discipline that involves the merging of imaging techniques with current computational methods. It is a spin-off of traditional computer graphics, a specialty not familiar to most science and engineering students. Thus, visualization in the sciences and engineering is most effectively addressed by interdisciplinary teams. Furthermore, the development of visualization tools has tended to be localized due to the lack of standards, the difficulty of creating interconnections across incompatible media, data transmission problems, and incompatible workstation environments. However, computer graphics are essentially available to everyone. Windowin , paint and inexpensive animation systems are availabke for all popular personal computers and most centralized computing facilities offer a wide variety of graphics packages. What is needed is a way in which to utilize commonly available computer graphics packages for the visualization of scientific data.</p><p>In 1987 and 1988, I attended the Educators' Workshops a t the national SIGGRAPH conferences. Each year, the Workshop focused on the need for an interdisciplinary approach to computer graphics. This opened up to me the possibility of incorporating such an approach into the Computer Graphics Laboratory course, a second computer graphics course in the undergraduate computer science curriculum at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). My approach was to include scientific visualization projects. I would like to share my experiences in the development and execution of this course, in the hope that others might be encouraged to take an interdis ciplinary approach in their courses.</p><p>This paper describes the interaction of computer graphics students from the computer science depart-ment and faculty from various disciplines in their attempts to utilize state-of-the-art computer graphics techniques for the visualization of physical systems. As a result of this interaction, students with different backgrounds have been able to learn new concepts and techniques that they would not normally be exposed to in their standard course of study. Hardware and software problems, as well as design and analysis difficulties are addressed by teams with diverse interests and training. The interdisciplinary challenges and solutions effectively simulate the real-world environment for which these students are receiving their educational training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">An Interdisciplinary Approach</head><p>The need for an interdisciplinary approach to the development of specialized visualization tools is clearly evident when one examines the current engineering, science, and computer science curricula. Most engineers and scientists, while educated to read and write, are not taught to communicate through images. Their education with respect to computers often involves little more than an introductory programming course or, in more progressive programs, the use of vendor supplied packages such as a CAD/CAM packages for circuit or structural design. Computer graphics courses give the computer science student the background to generate visualization tools, but generally the student lacks the depth in scientific or engineering fields to handle the total project. Thus, an interdisciplinary approach is not only appropriate, but necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The RIT Computer Graphics Laboratory Course</head><p>The Computer Graphics Laboratory course at RIT is the second course in a two course undergraduate computer science concentration. The first course is a typical "Introduction t o Computer Graphics'' lecture course that introduces the student to basic two-and three-dimensional computer graphics concepts. The Computer Graphics Laboratory course is less structured. It is a projected-oriented course which builds on topics introduced in the first course. In this second course, the students are required to do research into some advanced computer graphics topics. Each student then presents the results of his/her research to the class. It is suggested that the research be directly applicable to the graphics programming project that is the capstone of the course. For this project, the students are encouraged to work in teams. They are also urged to consider the issues of user interface design and module reuse. The completed project is then presented to the entire class. There is no required textbook for this course. Instead, many items relevant to computer graphics are placed on reserve in the RIT library.</p><p>Besides student presentations, class time in the Computer Graphics Laboratory course is spent in a variety of other ways. A certain portion of each class period (the class meets for a 2-hour period twice a week) is set aside for discussing research and project directions, as well as any problems that the students are encountering. Students are encouraged, in this manner, to share ideas and solutions to common problems. In addition, computer graphics video tapes such as the SIGGRAPH: "Visualization: State of the Art", SIGGRAPH: "Visualization Update", and the Public Broadcasting Station's NOVA: "The Strange New Science of Chaos" are viewed, several computer graphics laboratories for example, printing, engineeraround campus are visited, various professors present their computer graphics related research, and a lecture is given on how to prepare for the presentation of technical papers. The students are also encouraged to attend and participate in local ACM/SIGGRAPH functions. Workshops, I decided to include real-world, interdisciplinary, scientific visualization projects as possible course projects. That term, a team of four students proposed and began development of the Dynamic Modeling System (DMS), a system for visualizing the behavior of stra.nge attractors, under the direction of Professor Torok. Quite a large portion of this visualization project was completed during that 10 week period. Since then there have been some enhancements to DMS and others are planned.</p><p>The result of this joint effort was a product that has a practical application, and the generation of such enthusiasm on the part of both students and participating faculty that the interdisciplinary nature of the course has now been extended to include professors from mathematics, chemistry, and imaging science.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Preparation for the Course</head><p>In order to run a course of this type, the professor must be prepared to play the part of an organizational administrator. Much of the professor's preparation time must be spent before classes begins. For example, before the start of any term in which I teach this course, I lay out the schedule for that term. In order to do this, various departments on campus are canvased for suitable projects and mentors. The people responsible for computer graphics laboratories across campus are contacted and arrangements are made for tours and demonstrations. People doing research in arem of computer graphics are sought and persuaded to share their ideas. People from the art field are contacted to provide aesthetic insight into computer graphics design and people in the technical presentation area are contacted to provide guidance and instill confidence. The philosophy behind this structure is that the more exposure the student has to a variety of computer graphics systems and techniques, the bet-ter designed and the more sophisticated will be the product.</p><p>In addition to organizational activities, the professor must be prepared to act as a liaison between the various faculty mentors and the students. The professor, as the course coordinator, must guide both the faculty mentors and the students concerning specification requirements and the need for continued contact over the duration of the project. The professor must motivate the students to understand the way in which people in an application field need and want to use the proposed products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Student Visualization Projects</head><p>Highlighted below are three "completed" student projects involving scientific visualization. All of the projects described below have sophisticated, userfriendly interfaces. All were designed initially using SunView on Sun Microsystems 3/60 color workstations running SUN/OS 4.0.</p><p>The Dynamic Modeling System (DMS), a tool for the visualization and analysis of strange attractors, has been the center of focus for several student projects so far. The original DMS project was the first interdisciplinary visualization project in this course, as discussed above. This modeling system will be uti- A second visualization project was an interdisciplinary effort involving a chemistry professor. This professor was interested in producing a classroom aid which would help his students visualize the behavior of a magnetization vector in a rotating frame of reference. The equations involved (Bloch equations) are useful in describing the response of nuclear magnetization to an externally applied perturbation and are, therefore, utilized in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. The Nuclear Magnetic Resonance System (NMR) allows the user to specify the initial conditions of, and perturhations to, a set of magnetization vectors. The software calculates and displays the resulting behavior of the vectors. The display is a two-dimensional color representation of the three-dimensional motion of the vectors as well as a timing diagram showing the temporal application of the perturbations and the signals in the experiment.</p><p>Finally, interaction with a mathematics professor resulted in a project designed to explore the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. This project, which includes zoom capabilities as well as a color editor, has much potential for future enhancements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Student and Faculty Reactions</head><p>The reactions of both students and faculty involved in this course to the scientific visualization projects have been enthusiastic. Here are some comments about the course from recent student evaluation forms:</p><p>"The class was a lot more fun then I ever imagined a class could be." "This is the best class, by far, I've had at RIT. Courses giving students so much latitude, strengthen their decision making ability and increase their motivation to do their best." "I love the overall format and style in which this course was conducted. I had the maximum freedom to pursue what I was interested in and really focus on it. Meanwhile, I learned a lot by surveying the work of the other students.'' "The most fun I've had yet in my RIT educational experience."</p><p>When asked what they had learned from the course, they responded that they had increased their general computer graphics knowledge, they had learned about graphical interfacing, time management, project management, how to work with others and how to help each other, how to give presentations, and that their interpretive skills were strengthened by learning about new graphics systems through the reading of manufacturer's manuals. (Most students choose to develop their projects using graphics systems that are different from the one taught in the introductory course.)</p><p>Comments about the visualization projects included: "The project had meaning; we were doing something for someone else." "If it wasn't for the [outside] teacher (real-world), I doubt I would care so much." "Our package was to be used; this inspired us to produce a quality product." "He defined the system. We had an expert to go to and ask questions. We learned about things other than computer graphics and computer science." "We got a new look at the material and from a different perspective." "I think it helps a lot to work on a team project and on something useful for real life." "I learned a lot by working on a real project and by having interaction with someone like a boss on a co-op job. This project helped prepare me for co-op or real-life rather than just doing research from books and working with formulas." "His vision and theoretical expertise allowed us to take-on a project that otherwise would have been beyond our capability to accomplish given the time constraints." "He was so excited about the material that I couldn't help but become excited too." "I got to work on an interesting project!''</p><p>The professors who have served as mentors are also enthusiastic. One states: ''I am truly impressed with the quality of the software package. The graphics presentation and 'user-friendliness' of the package was first rate. Because of this positive experience, I would like to continue to be involved with this course." All of the mentors want to come back for more.</p><p>There have been some difficulties, principally involving communication. One team reported that they had "problems a t times in getting specifics." Another reported that "he did not know what we could and could not do in the program at first. This resulted in many changes in the proposed system." There was one interdisciplinary project that simply did not work. Here too the problem was a lack of communication. One of the team members reported: ''I got to know his answering machine well." This proved to be a very frustrating experience for all concerned. This same student said: "This project has been one of the most frustrating experiences of my life.</p><p>was supposed to be a technical advisor. Instead he sent us complicated formulae that we really couldn't use. He did not understand that we didn't know all about _____ and the information he provided us reflected this. And he was never available to explain things." (I should add that this team of students still felt that they had learned a lot from the course and they were at least able to develop a sophisticated user interface.) Communication difficulties are usually not insurmountable and the course coordinator can help smooth the way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Rewards</head><p>The rewards of running this course are many. This course provides an opportunity for the professor to interact with students in ways not found in typical computer science courses. There is an opportunity for both the professors and the students to experience the meeting of minds across a variety of disciplines. The outside seeding of this graphics course is very exciting to the students and professors alike. The computer science students are able to work on real-world projects with the prospect of seeing the product actually used. This tends to make the students more prepared to put themselves out and generally results in more polished products. They learn about scientific areas that they might never have explored otherwise. They learn about working with others who have a different perspective on things and learn to mold their product to be useful to those others. The interaction between student and mentor helps to develop the student's communication skills. The interdisciplinary aspects of projects of this nature tend to generate such overall enthusiasm that some students continue to work on their projects after the course has ended, some for independent study credit, others for personal satisfaction. These projects are more open-ended than normal graphics projects and stimulate the visual imagination of the students and professors alike. Students in the course are delighted and often surprised to see quality systems emerge both from their own work and that of other teams. The students become very supportive of each other.</p><p>There have been other interesting developments arising from the Computer Graphics Laboratory course. Several students from the course have gone on to work on independent study projects in computer graphics. One (undergraduate) student from the course presented a paper on the Dynamic hlodeling System for the Seventh International Conference on Mathematical and Computer Modeling in Chicago <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(August 1989)</ref>. This same student became involved in a Cornell University research project (in an NSF sponsored Undergraduate Research Experience program) in three-dimensional animation using supercomputers. This latter project was an interdisciplinary one that also involved a film and video professor and an art student. Others of my former graphics students continue to explore various computer graphics techniques for their own personal satisfaction. Two have made use of the supercomputer facilities a t Cornell University to generate sophisticated images by applying a combina tion of techniques, including ray tracing with several types of objects, different lighting properties, fractal mountain generation, as well as texture mapping. In a continuing quest for ways to speedup the generation of their graphical images, these same two have joined with a student who has parallel computing experience to work on a linda-like <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref> project to harness RIT's network of workstations as a graphics engine. Yet another former graphics student took a computer animation course through the RIT film and video program after completing the computer science graphics concentration. The resulting cross-fertilization of disciplines proved rewarding for everyone involved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Lessons Learned/Rules for the Road</head><p>What follows is a list of things to keep in mind, should you decide to try to set up a course of this type. The first items are pertinent to the course generally; these are followed by others specific to interdisciplinary scientific visualization projects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.1">General lessons:</head><p>0 Running a course of this nature requires good organizational skills. Much of the scheduling must be done well before the term begins.</p><p>0 Exposing students to as many graphical systems and techniques and as much research as possible improves the quality of the projects produced. This holds also for the introductory course. By making available completed projects from previous terms, the overall quality of the assignments submitted in subsequent courses has increased significantly.</p><p>0 Projects should be developed in teams. This provides the students with a more "real-world" environment, improves their communication skills, provides the potential for larger projects, and adds peer pressure as an inducement to perform well. ft should be noted that students in this course ave already had some team project experience in at least two other RIT courses and often through their co-op work experiences.)</p><p>Teams should elect a team leader. Although there is usually a reluctance to do this, the teams that do find they have an easier time handling the project. Grading for the course should be partially dependent on peer evaluation. In this course, peer evaluation counts for lOof the final grade -5research presentation and 5Here again, peer pressure works wonders for performance.</p><p>e The need for continued communication between the project mentor and the student team cannot be stressed too strongly. The students must be made aware that it is important that the visualization project be designed with users' needs in mind. They are not creating a product and then finding a user for it; they are creating a product for a particular set of users with particular needs.</p><p>Be as flexible as possible, both in terms of the kinds of projects that are acceptable and with the kinds of software packages that are available. The students in this course have several levels of graphics packages available to choose from, such as SunCore, G I G , PHIGS, SunView, Sun's Pixrect and X-windows. Most have been exposed only to SunCore prior to this course.</p><p>Weekly progress reports and open classroom discussion of problems that have arisen during the implementation of the projects are useful i n encouraging the student to stay on top of things. Again peer pressure, the fear of looking bad in front of their fellow students, plays a large part.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interdisciplinary Project Lessons:</head><p>Potential mentors should have a clear understanding of what is expected of them. Their initial presentations should be geared towards the generation of enthusiasm for working on their projects. They should be prepared for continued interaction with the student team throughout the term. Ideally this should include either weekly or biweekly meetings.</p><p>Be prepared to apply subtle pressure, if necessary, t o get all of the mentors' projects covered. Point out the obvious advantages t o the students in terms of help with project design and a product that will have a life after the course is over. Also point out that if a project is not covered, the course is likely to lose the participation of that mentor.</p><p>Proposed scientific visualization projects should be able to be at least partially completed in the time allotted, ie., the students should be able to produce some graphical output which can then be used as a basis for the completion later by other teams or through independent study projects.</p><p>The course coordinator must be prepared to serve as mediator/facilitator in interactions between project mentors and student teams. The course coordinator must walk a fine line here. It is important to warn the students about the potential for a serious problem. It is also important not to scare them off. It is all too easy to let things get out of hand. If communication problems cannot be overcome, it is important to find a way for the students to proceed with the project and, therefore. derive some amount of sat,isfaction.</p><p>e Be ready for much enthusiasm, a supportive interstudent environment, and a lot of fun.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">Summary and Conclusions</head><p>An interdisciplinary experiment involving a mechanical engineering professor and a computer science professor has resulted in the evolution of the RIT Computer Graphics Laboratory course so as to include strong interdisciplinary and scientific visualization components. The course is a good consumer of computer science skills in an important application area and has proved extremely rewarding for all participants. However, it takes an instructor who is an organizer at heart to make it work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>A</head><label></label><figDesc>preliminary version of portions of this material was presented as part of the Educators' Seminar at ACM/SIGGRAPH '90.</figDesc></figure>

A pseudo-phase plane plotting option is also available. DMS has continued to evolve since its inception. Independent studies projects have added options, such as limited zooming and internal generation of trajectory data via a fourth-order, variable-step, Runge-Kutta technique. A second team project in the 1989 session of the Compuber Graphics Laboratory course has ported DMS to X-windows (XDMS) and added options such as the display of axes and generalized zoom. The porting to X-windows makes this project portable to systems other than the Sun Microsystem workstations and, thus, more readily usable within the current computing environment of the n~echanical engineering department.</figDesc></figure>
