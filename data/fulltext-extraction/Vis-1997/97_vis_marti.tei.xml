<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The Initial Graphics Exchange Standard, IGES <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, was created to provide a portable means of communicating Computer-aided Design information between different computers and systems. Viewing the designs in 3 dimensions has required high performance (costly) graphics engines. The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9]</ref>) was created to provide users 3 dimensional access to simulated worlds from inexpensive computer platforms. This paper presents the iges2vrml program that translates IGES into VRML.</p><p>We were presented with the problem of viewing engineering designs generated by different CAD platforms and of placing these designs in a virtual environment. These systems are capable of generating IGES files from their proprietary formats. The users wished to compare different designs and were unwilling to learn the complexities of the different CAD systems to do so. Our approach involves translating the IGES file into a VRML description and then viewing the results with any of the available VRML viewers such as Silicon Graphic's CosmoPlayer <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> or Sony's Community Place <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> either stand alone or connected to browsers such as Netscape or Microsoft's Explorer.</p><p>The translation process most concerns us. For reasons of portability and expediency, the system was implemented in Java <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. This approach allows unparalleled portability among operating systems and hardware -our compiled translator runs on all platforms and operating systems. Interpreted Java is unreasonably slow when converting large IGES files requiring considerable floating-point Defense Group Inc., 333 South, 200 East, Suite 102, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111, marti@axxis.com computation, however, reasonable efficiency is possible when using "just-in-time" compilation.</p><p>VRML as a target translation has many advantages. There is a recognized standard and documentation (though VRML version 2</p><p>is not yet supported by all commercial viewers). VRML viewers are supported on a variety of platforms from the largest image generators to low end personal computers. Learning to use a VRML viewer is straight forward, typically requiring only a few minutes orientation: the interface is intuitive, even with only a mouse for interaction. Finally, we experience very little loss of visual information between the IGES and translated VRML files.</p><p>During 6 months of system implementation and use we have uncovered a number of problems:</p><p>1. None of the viewers is yet a complete implementation of the VRML 2 standard.</p><p>2. VRML is not sufficiently rich to adequately represent smooth spline surfaces and other curves. This necessitates complex mechanisms for improving the level of detail for close examination of curves.</p><p>3. Different viewers render entities differently. This is particularly true when lighting models are invoked.</p><p>4. Early versions of the viewers had many rendering bugs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.</head><p>Interpreted Java is very slow when long streams of floatingpoint computation and I/O are involved.</p><p>6. The initial Java compilers had some annoying problems associated with large procedures and showed poor data-flow analysis for marking unassigned variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7.</head><p>The initial Java compilers did not always perform correct dependency analysis of programs with many related modules.</p><p>Despite these problems, the results of translating over 50 IGES files into VRML has encouraged us beyond our original expectations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>The Initial Graphics Exchange Specification, or IGES for short, was designed for "...the digital representation and communication of product definition data." <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The standard has evolved over a number of years and sponsors. A standing committee, IGES/PDES, maintains and improves the standard which is currently at version 5.3 (though the figures in this paper are all version 5.2).</p><p>The IGES standard supports the following entity types:</p><p>Geometry These entities describe geometrical entities in 3 dimensions. This includes items such as: points, lines, arcs, splines curves, spline surfaces, surfaces of revolution, surfaces generated by curves, and trimmed surfaces.</p><p>Annotation Arrows, dimensions, witness lines, center lines, text, and tables. VRML's design characteristics (from the standard) important to this project include:</p><p>Author-ability VRML files can be generated by programs -the format is simple and not proprietary.</p><p>Completeness VRML contains sufficient power of expression to support some visualization of most IGES entities without extreme conversion measures (with some exceptions as will be noted).</p><p>Performance VRML viewer implementations have sufficient performance for efficient display of all but the most complex designs on inexpensive computer platforms. It is this design characteristic that effectively limits our representation of spline and other curved surfaces.</p><p>Well Structured VRML sports few side effects and is relatively easy to translate to. The resulting translation uses reasonable space and is not overly verbose.</p><p>VRML has a large user community and numerous tools for viewing and creating virtual worlds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The Translation Problem</head><p>Translating an IGES file into VRML is a two stage process. The first pass creates parameterizations of deferred entities -those items that will be used to create composite objects. The IGES standard allows forward references to these objects necessitating the second pass. For example, a surface of revolution requires a center line for the axis of rotation and starting point, and a curve to rotate about that axis. Each of these items is a separate entity in the IGES file.</p><p>The second pass performs the translation. A maximum bounds is kept so that an initial viewpoint can be generated if one is not expressed in the IGES file.</p><p>The following sections describe the translation process in some detail with an emphasis on conversions that overcome VRML's various shortcomings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Multiple Levels of Detail</head><p>A key to fast rendering (and collision detection) of smooth curves and surfaces is representation of multiple levels of detail -a VRML concept designed to supplement its lack of curve representation and improve performance. The VRML viewer computes the distance between the eye-point and target object's bounding box. It then scans a table associated with multiple level of detail objects for the appropriate representation and displays it.</p><p>VRML's instancing capabilities permit convenientrepresentation of this information. Typically, we compute object coordinates to the highest level of resolution deemed necessary. For example, to generate circular arcs we generate as much as one line segment per degree. Each level of detail selects point subsets from this data -usually dividing by 2 the number in the previous level down to some minimum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Tessellation</head><p>Unlike some of the ray tracing representations of 3 dimensional worlds, VRML does not provide parametric representations of curved surfaces beyond spheres and cones. Consequently, our translation process must generate a tessellated surface -either triangles or quadrilaterals. In particular:</p><p>Parametric and Rational B-spline surfaces. We generate quadrilaterals and leave to VRML folding them for non-planar points.</p><p>Surfaces of rotation are parameterized along the generating curve and about the central axis to present a smooth surface.</p><p>Tabulated surfaces generated by a single curve and swept line segment.</p><p>Surfaces between two curves are singly parameterized for the longest curve to generate smooth appearance when viewing the entire surface.</p><p>The most important consideration is balancing the number of generated quadrilaterals with speed and storage requirements. More facets results in a smoother appearance but quickly reduces rendering speed on all but the most capable processors. Our experience suggests that for most general purpose machines, the polygon saturation point -where performance degrades to the point where the user cannot negotiate the scene (about 4-6 frames per second) -is approximately the same: 10,000 untextured polygons.</p><p>Computation of number of segments is typically bounded by minimum and maximum number of segments and a function of curve length times a user selected factor. An IGES curve g are parameterized between two values u0 and u1 and with a user selected factor f we typically generate:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">segments = min f Z u 1 u 0 gudu max</formula><p>For surfaces this is computed along both defining curves except for tabulated surfaces (only the curve is parameterized), and ruled surfaces (the largest number of segments computed for both curves is selected). In our experience this is appropriate for most engineering designs where the user might wish to examine any piece in exquisite detail. This may not be the case when generating virtual worlds for entertainment where the extra detail would most likely be ignored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Lines and Arrows</head><p>Displaying two dimensional entities in three dimensions challenges VRML as it does not support dotted and dashed lines. We made the following decisions:</p><p>1. Textured lines are not supported because of problems with maintaining the texture at various distances.</p><p>2. Arrows and other leaders are two dimensional parallel to the X Y plane. We apply IGES transformations for other orientations.</p><p>3. Multiple levels of detail for leaders are not supported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Materials and Texture Map Surfaces</head><p>IGES supports several different material types and texture map surfaces. Where these are iconic or generic representations (concrete, composite, etc.) we hand generated JPEG images and used VRML's pixel texture feature to generate the map on the entities surface. More specific materials (steel, copper, etc.) are represented by modifications of the entity's color and specular characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Text</head><p>Different VRML players provide different levels of text support. VRML does not support 3 dimensional text except as laboriously defined by the user. Consequently text disappears when viewed edge on. A potential solution to this problem is the use of billboards that remain perpendicular to the user's viewpoint. Unfortunately, none of the VRML fonts available readily match some of the more esoteric IGES symbol fonts. It is expected that we must eventually support a few of the symbol fonts with surfaces or lines defined by files that can be included with the source VRML.</p><p>The only other problem with the VRML representation is the lack of a slant parameter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Viewpoints and Lights</head><p>IGES provides some approximations for viewpoints but no representation of lighting. The program generates viewpoints corresponding to the IGES viewpoints -a selectable list appears for the VRML user.</p><p>The user's avatar, his representation in the virtual world, has a headlight but this can have unwanted effects in some instances -particularly when surfaces have texture maps and are shiny. Likewise, unless so programmed, the avatar can't get inside of solid figures.</p><p>The VRML lighting and surface models allow for reasonable representations of various construction materials. However, IGES lumps many of these together under categories of similar physical, not visible, properties. Future work will determine whether it's worth attempting to generate appropriate VRML surface characteristics for the underlying IGES description.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">2D problems</head><p>VRML is not overly successful displaying 2 dimensional drawings. The methods for pan and zoom that work in 3 dimensions are, at best, clumsy when working with line drawings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>We've translated approximately 50 files. Some were generated especially for test purposes and others came from other sources -including those used to create the IGES documentation. Lack of suitable IGES test files and approximates of what they represent lead us to develop a test file generation program, igesbld. The program translates ASCII descriptions of IGES entities performing the appropriate bookkeeping for sequence numbers and pointers. Using a CAD system to generate a test suite is inappropriate as the generation code itself cannot be adequately tested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Translation Speed</head><p>Translating large IGES files is inconveniently slow when using contemporary Java systems. This is particularly true when generating smooth surfaces with many facets (for example rational B-spline surfaces). In part this is due to ASCII generation of large numbers of double-precision floating-point numbers, but mostly due to the interpreted nature of Java.</p><p>The "just in time" Java compilation mechanism translates Java virtual machine operation codes into the instructions of the host computer. As you can see in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, the results are impressive when generation requires significant floating-point computation (file C) but less so where large amounts of I/O are involved (file B). All values were generated on a Silicon Graphics O2 processor with 32 megabytes of RAM running IRIX 6.3. All the class files were precompiled and all times are in seconds.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">File Size</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">VRML Output</head><p>An important use of the translation is placing engineering designs in virtual worlds. For example, the following figure represents the design of an electronic golf club (generated by the igesbld program) as translated from IGES into VRML showing some detail of the display.</p><p>To improve the image's presentation, it is included in a virtual golf course and grasped by the hands of a virtual golfer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Future Work</head><p>We have identified a number of areas to improve in the translator. Some of these extend the translation process while others improve its utility in the internet environment.</p><p>1. Determining the number of facets and line segments based on global design size rather than local information. At the moment, the user must tune the level of resolution for his particular purposes often resulting in very large VRML files.</p><p>2. Using knowledge of a generator's line type to control its parameterization when creating surfaces. This includes using the parametric representation's derivative to control the placement and number of generated points.</p><p>3. Dotted and dashed lines exploiting multiple levels of detail.</p><p>4. Implement surfaces with lands (holes) and trimmed surfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5</head><p>. Implement the IGES CSG and Manifold solid B-rep items.</p><p>6. Generate 2D views "on-the-fly" using only Java. As IGES files are already registered Mime types, a network browser encountering an IGES file would simply call the translator and display the results in VRML (for 3D) or call a Java based display program for 2D drawings.</p><p>7. Generate animations for part assembly to check for collisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>Displaying CAD designs in the network browser paradigm is a useful adjunct to the availability of a large commercial CAD package. Such an approach allows the unsophisticated user to examine and interact with complicated designs in a useful manner. It is of special interest to complex machine constructors that would like to showcase their designs in complex, interactive environments.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Transformations 3 dimensional transformations.
