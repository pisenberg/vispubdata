				<p>We present a new method to produce a hierarchical set of triangle meshes that can be used to blend different levels of detail in a smooth fashion. The algorithm produces a sequence of meshes M0;M1; M2;:::;Mn, where each mesh Mi can be transformed to mesh Mi+1 through a set of triangle-collapse operations. For each triangle, a function is generated that approximates the underlying surface in the area of the triangle, and this function serves as a basis for assigning a weight to the triangle in the ordering operation, and for supplying the point to which the triangles are collapsed. This technique allows us to view a triangulated surface model at varying levels of detail while insuring that the simplified mesh approximates the original surface well.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The most critical and fundamental research problem encountered in the visualization of complex models is the development of methods for storing, approximating, and rendering the very large data sets that define them. The problem is to develop different representations of the data set, each of which can be substituted for the complete set depending on the requirements of the visualization technique. The data set may be represented by a few points, or by several million points if necessary, with each of the data sets containing the essential features of the original data. A hierarchical or multiresolution representation allows the study of large-scale features by considering the data set at a coarse resolution and the study of small-scale features by considering the data set at a fine resolution.</p><p>fgieng,hamann,joy,schussma,trottsg@cs.ucdavis.edu</p><p>We introduce a method to produce a hierarchical representation of large unstructured triangle meshes. Given an initial mesh M0, our algorithm reduces the number of triangles through a series of triangle-collapse operations. A triangle is selected from the mesh and removed by collapsing it to a point (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>. A weight is assigned to each triangle and is used as the criterion to select triangles to be collapsed. This weight is partially based on a curvature measure determined by the principal curvatures of a function that approximates the surface in the area of each triangle. To insure that the new mesh accurately approximates the underlying surface, we use the surface approximate to supply the point to which the triangle is collapsed.</p><p>In a given mesh, we can identify a number of triangles that can be collapsed simultaneously, and this allows our algorithm to output a sequence of meshes M0;M1;M2;:::;Mn with the property that Mi can be smoothly collapsed to Mi+1. By collapsing a relatively large number of triangles in an intermediate triangulation simultaneously, we achieve significant memory savings. Thus the transition from mesh Mi to Mi+1 is characterized by collapsing many triangles in parallel -instead of collapsing just one. The sequence of meshes, along with the triangle-collapse operation, can be used to create a smooth visual transition between levels in the hierarchy of triangle meshes.</p><p>In Section 2, we discuss the related work in mesh reduction. We examine the triangle-collapse operation in Section 3. Here we define what it means for a triangle to be "collapsible," and exhibit the effect of the triangle-collapse operation on the mesh. In Section 4, we construct a function that approximates the underlying surface in the area of a triangle. This approximating surface is used in two ways: (1) to define the point to which a triangle will collapse, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> to assign weights to the triangles. The calculation of the weights is discussed in Section 5. In Section 6, we give a complete description of the algorithm which generates a sequence of triangle-collapse operations and a sequence of meshes. Implementation issues are discussed in Section 7 and results of the algorithm's use are given in Section 8.</p></div>

In this algorithm, vertices are identified through a distance-to-plane criterion, where an average plane is formed through a vertex and its adjacent vertices. If the vertex is within a specified distance of the average plane, it can be deleted, otherwise it is retained. Removing a vertex from the mesh creates a hole that must be re-triangulated, and several strategies may be used.</p><p>Hoppe <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> describes a continuous-resolution representation of a mesh, based upon an edge-collapse operation. The mesh reduction problem is formulated in terms of a optimization problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, ordering the edges according to an energy minimization function. The result is an initial coarse representation of the mesh, and a linear list of edge-collapse operations, each of which can be regenerated to generate finer representations of the mesh. The geometricallycontinuous edge-collapse operation allows the development of a smooth visual transition between various levels of the representation.</p><p>Hamann <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> has developed an algorithm that simplifies the mesh by removing triangles. Triangles are selected for removal by first ordering them according to the principal curvatures at their vertices (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>). The curvature values are pre-computed based on the original triangulated mesh. Triangles are then inserted into a priority queue and removed iteratively. Modified triangles have new curvatures calculated at their vertices and are inserted back into the priority queue. The user can specify a percentage of triangles to be removed or an error tolerance.</p><p>Our algorithm is also based upon a triangle-removal strategy but creates a hierarchy of meshes, not just a hierarchy of triangles. These meshes can be used to create a continuous-reduction algorithm that enables us to vary the level of detail over the set of meshes and to blend the levels in a continuous-resolution representation of the data set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">TRIANGLE-COLLAPSE OPERATIONS</head><p>In this context, our surface is a piecewise linear surface defined by a mesh of triangles. We require that the triangle mesh be connected and that each edge in the mesh be shared by at most two triangles. Meshes should not be self-intersecting -that is, no triangle of the mesh should have an intersection with the interior of another triangle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Stencils</head><p>If we are to collapse a given triangle T, it is the triangles surrounding T that influence the resulting mesh after the collapse. This set of triangles, the stencil ST of T, is the set of triangles Ti, where The shaded triangle has a connected acyclic stencil; (b) the shaded triangle has a disconnected acyclic stencil; (c) the shaded triangle has a connected cyclic stencil; and (d) the shaded triangle has a complete stencil. In this last case, the stencil boundary polygon is outlined in bold. We note that the boundary polygon of the triangle in (a) would contain a vertex of the triangle, and therefore the stencil is not complete.</p><p>Ti 6 = T and such that Ti shares a vertex with T (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>).

If this polygon contains no vertices of the original triangle T, the stencil is called complete. Examples of various triangles and their stencils are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Considerations when collapsing a triangle</head><p>As can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, as a triangle is collapsed, the triangle and its neighbors are eliminated from the mesh. The triangle is replaced by a single point, which is connected to all points of the stencil boundary polygon, creating a new triangulation of the region. The new mesh contains four fewer triangles. Geometrically, this transition is smooth; topologically, it is "discontinuous" when the three vertices eventually become one. The collapsing process can introduce triangles with acyclic stencils. Cycles in the stencil occur only in neighboring triangles and each triangle in the cycle must have a vertex of valence three. If any of the points p 1 , p2, or p3 has valence four, collapsing the triangle T will result in reducing the valence of this vertex by onethus creating a vertex of valence three and a cycle. This cycle will cause three triangles of the mesh to have acyclic stencils (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4)</ref>. We define a collapsible triangle as one that does not introduce additional cycles as a result of the collapsing step.</p><p>Collapsing a triangle affects all triangles in the stencil. If the stencil is "oddly shaped," this can potentially create folds in the resulting triangles. To avoid this problem, we require the stencil boundary stencil. polygon, when projected onto the plane of the triangle, to be starshaped.</p><p>With these observations, we define a triangle T to be collapsible if (1) it has a complete stencil ST; (2) the unique vertices of the neighboring triangles that are not part of the triangle T do not have valence four; and (3) its boundary polygon is star-shaped when projected to the plane of the triangle. With the collapsing operation, vertices change valences, and triangles disappear. Thus a triangle may not be collapsible in one mesh of the hierarchy, but may be collapsible in other meshes. To collapse a triangle, we only need identify the stencil boundary polygon and the point cP to which the triangle is collapsed. For a complete discussion of the topological considerations of the collapsing operation, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p></div>

In the second case, the ancestral points of T are the union of the ancestral points of T 0 and those of TC. (see <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have introduced a new algorithm for the hierarchical representation of very large triangle meshes. The algorithm generates a hierarchical set of meshes for a given triangular mesh. This algorithm produces a sequenceof meshes M0;M1;M2;:::;Mn, where each mesh Mj is collapsed to mesh Mj+1 through a set of simultaneous triangle-collapse operations. For each triangle, a function is generated that approximates the underlying surface in the area of the triangle, and this function serves as a basis for assigning weights to each triangle and for supplying the point to which triangles are collapsed. Using this representation allows us to display a large triangle mesh at various levels of detail in real time, while preserving the geometry of the original mesh.</p><p>This work has extended previous work on level-of-detail analysis for triangle meshes in several ways. First, our algorithm focuses on the triangle as a primitive -and the triangle-collapse operation as the primary reduction strategy for the mesh. Second, our algorithm produces a sequence of meshes which, together with the trianglecollapse operation, can be used to produce a continuous level-ofdetail variation in the model. We have integrated this model into a prototype viewing system that supports interactive level-of-detail manipulation of complex models defined by large triangle meshes. Finally, whenever we compute the location of a new vertex replacing a triangle, we consider the ancestral hierarchy created by the collapse operations calculate the weights of triangles using the original surface data.
