			<abstract>
				<p>Measurement, analysis, and visualization of plant growth is of primary interest to plant biologists. We are developing software tools to support such investigation. There are two parts in this investigation, namely, growth visualization of (i) a plant root and (ii) a plant stem. For both domains, the input data is a stream of images taken by cameras. The tools being developed make it possible to measure various time-varying quantities such as differential growth. For both domains, the plant is modeled by using flexible templates to represent nonrigid motions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Motivation</head><p>In plant biology, it is of interest to study the effects of various environmental conditions (including light, gravity, and moisture) on the growth of a plant. Research questions in plant biology would include:</p><p>Which part of the root grows most actively over time?</p><p>How quickly does the root or stem of the plant react when environmental conditions change?</p><p>Which plants are more sensitive to the influence of gravity than others?</p><p>We describe visualization tools for plant biologists to extract such information from a stream of image data obtained by digital cameras. In particular, we are interested in two aspects of the problem, namely, plant root growth and plant stem growth. In both cases, the subject is a nonrigid (i.e., flexibly growing) object that requires new modeling schemes for representation. We have adopted an approach based on spatiotemporal flexible templates to capture the growth of a plant in 2D and 3D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Past work</head><p>A wide variety of models have been used for object reconstruction from images. Kumar and Goldgof <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> use hyperquadrics to estimate nonrigid motion from mammogram images. Deformable superquadrics have also been used for object reconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. As for flexible object tracking, much work has been done on energy minimization approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. The approaches are used to identify and track 2D and 3D object boundaries based on 2D images and 3D voxel images. Research in flexible object recognition is also pursued at a variety of labs including Yale <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and Leeds <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, model-based posture recognition has been actively studied in term of human posture tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, a genetic algorithm is used to identify the posture of a human upper torso from multiple views, while in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> a best-first search algorithm is used to find a parameter set that best describes the images. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, a model-based approach is proposed to estimate hand posture. Our problem is distinguishable from these approaches in that a plant is more flexible (i.e., it grows) and smooth (no joints).</p><p>Some computer analysis of real and simulated plant growth has been done <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. For root analysis, the past approach has been to measure changes in the boundary length of a plant root; in our approach, it is possible to measure deformation interior to the root as well. For the measurement of stem growth, reconstruction in 3D makes it possible to analyze 3D shape changes which are difficult to capture using only 2D projections. Such an approach to plant physiology has not been reported in the past.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Outline</head><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define the problem of root growth visualization and describe an approach to addressing it. In Section 3, the problem of plant stem growth modeling is stated and our approach is presented together with preliminary results. Finally, Section 4 discusses domain implications and Section 5 contains some concluding remarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Root Growth Visualization 2.1 Problem</head><p>Plate 1 shows the lab setup for acquiring root images. A plant root is grown in transparent gel or in humid air (depending on species) and the growth is monitored by a camera from the front. Plate 2 contains a sample snapshot of a growing primary root of maize. The dark spots are small beads that are deposited manually on the surface of the root before the experiment begins. These beads are used as landmarks to measure growth. Depending on the experimental conditions and the expected rate of growth, images are grabbed and stored with inter-picture delays ranging from 1 minute to 30 minutes. The root is oriented vertically initially. After characterizing growth in this orientation the root is oriented horizontally and the growth pattern is monitored as the root bends down toward the gravity vector.</p><p>The objective is to identify the pattern of growth rate distribution within the root. It is apparent that the tip of the root moves fastest. However, this does not necessarily indicate that the tip is the fastestgrowing region, since the tip is pushed forward by the rest of the root. Thus, we need to identify the 'relative growth' of various parts of the root.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Approach</head><p>To achieve the goal, we wish to come up with a function to describe the root growth. The following image-space method is an adaptation of a parametric deformation method which is used for image matching in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In this method, a rubber-sheet mapping between two images is formulated as follows.</p><p>x; y ! x;y + D x x; y + D y x; y where the displacement functions D x x; y and D y x;y are continuous and satisfy the following boundary conditions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D x 0; y = D x 1; y = D y x; 0 = D y x; 1 = 0</formula><p>The space of such displacement functions is known to be spanned by the following basis: e x mn x; y = 2 sinnxcosmy;0 e y mn x; y = 0 ; 2 cosmxsinny where m; n = 1 ; 2 ; . Thus, the displacement function Dx; y can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D x x; y; D y x; y = 1 X m=1 1 X n=1 c</formula><p>x mn e x mn + c y mn e y mn where c's are coefficient to be determined. Ordinarily, only a finite number of terms in the above infinite series are used to define a deformation mapping. To determine the coefficients, the beads that attach to the root surface are used as control points, and their positions and displacements are used to obtain initial estimation of the coefficients by linear fitting. Boundary points are then added to the above calculation to obtain a finer mapping. The coefficients calculated from above uniquely define the displacement functions, and hence the deformation mapping. A nice feature of the formulation is that the deformation is smooth everywhere spatially.</p><p>The method outlined above is effective in mapping between two given images. However, it may not necessarily generate temporally smooth deformation for a series of images. We extend this approach so that a series of images may be handled to generate a smooth transition throughout the images. To do so, we describe the deformation in time-dependent coefficient space in which each c is a smooth function of time. To achieve this, we use a Catmull-Rom spline to interpolate the curve in coefficient space. This results in a deformation that is smooth in the temporal dimension as well as in the spatial dimension.</p><p>The extended approach is applied to measure root elongation for a series of images. As a result of the above formulation, displacement can now be written down as a function of x, y, and t, that is, each point can be tracked in time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Preliminary Results</head><p>Plate 3 contains a snapshot of root growth analysis showing a root embedded in a grid to illustrate the deformation. To identify an active zone, we can differentiate displacement functions along the spine direction at each pixel to find out how fast each pixel is expanding.</p><p>Let us use f instead of D to denote the displacement vector field.</p><p>Plate 4 contains u r f , where u is the spine direction of the root. In short, this image gives you the following information. How actively is each point stretched along the direction parallel to the spine? (or equivalently, how large is the growth along the direction parallel to the spine?)</p><p>Since displacement vector f = f x ; f y is a function in x and y, we can think of partial derivatives such as @fx @y and @fx @x . In general, we can think of directional derivatives @ @s , i.e., derivative along a certain orientation s. We call this the growth vector along s. Using notations from vector calculus, the growth vector may be expressed as @ @s = l @ @x + m @ @y + n @ @z = u r</p><p>where u = l; m; n is the unit vector of line s. (In our case, n = 0 .) The directional derivative is sometimes written as Du.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> illustrates the oval icon used for display. Vector OA represents the direction that maximizes the growth vector. We add growth vector AB to OA; vector OB is used to determine the primary axis of the oval. When displayed as is, the oval generated this way usually looks almost like a circle to a human, since dmax and dmin have nearly the same value. Thus, we exaggerate the shape of the oval so that we can compare the shape difference better.</p><p>The exaggerated oval shows shape change at each grid point.</p><p>Here is how we exaggerate the oval using parameter: </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Let scale =</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Stem Growth Visualization</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Problem</head><p>Seedlings of the popular experimental species Arabidopsis thaliana are grown in a black box fitted with light filters (see Plate 6) since there is a need to control the quality of light reaching the plant. Images are taken with two CCD cameras from orthogonal directions for 3D shape recovery; an infrared back-light that does not affect growth is the sole illumination. This setting provides silhouette images of the object. Depending on the experimental conditions and the expected rate of growth, images are grabbed and stored with inter-picture delays ranging from 1 minute to 30 minutes. Plate 7 contains snapshots of orthogonal images of stem growth. The biological researcher would like to obtain a variety of measurements of the plant, such as rate of growth, hook opening and plant rotation measured over time. To obtain measurements of the plant as a three dimensional object, it is first necessary to have an internal 3D model of the plant's structure at each time stage. Then, measurements can be taken from this model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Approach</head><p>First, a standard Canny edge detector is applied to segment the object from the background and then the interior is filled. In our experiments, the images obtained are reasonably clear so that there is no need to apply any further segmentation algorithm.</p><p>We are investigating a top-down time-varying template-space search approach that seems to handle noise and occlusion in a robust manner with relatively small accuracy tradeoffs. Given multiple 2D images of a 3D plant, our approach is to use a priori knowledge about the sorts of shapes the plant might take on. This leads to the idea of a model which could describe the plant at any stage in any orientation. Since the model is too complex to search over model-space, we consider a template that serves as a set of control points describing the model.</p><p>With the use of an error criterion that compares the silhouettes to virtual images rendered from the model, the problem reduces to a search of template-space. As a measure to estimate how close the reconstructed 3D shape is with respect to the input image, we use the following metric:</p><p>error= unmatched pixels matched pixels</p><p>where matched pixels are those pixels found both in the real silhouette image and the projection of the 3D reconstructed shape, and unmatched pixels are those found only in one of them. We take the average of the errors in the two orthogonal views.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plant Model</head><p>The model that we use to describe the plant is a tubular object; that is, a 3D spine with a thickness that can vary along the length. In other words, the model is a set of four parametric functions: Model = fxt; y t ; z t ; r t g :</p><p>In this representation, x; y; z describe the location of the spine and r is the radius of the tube at a given normalized location t (0 t 1 ) along the spine. The current model does not handle bifurcation (branching).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Template</head><p>The template is a set of control points designed to represent a model using relatively few parameters. This number of parameters is important; the template needs to have sufficient degrees of freedom to cover the model-space, yet it is this number that determines the search time. The general model is as follows: P = 3 n + n , 1k + n;</p><p>where: P is the number of parameters in the template, n is the number of spine control points, and k is the number of radius control points between them.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Searching Template-space</head><p>Currently we use a multiresolution (coarse-to-fine) method with a steepest descent search to find a reasonable solution in a limited amount of time. Starting with the template that best described the previous frame, the search generates new possibilities by adjusting each of the 28 parameters up or down by a certain distance.</p><p>Each template is tested to see if it describes the input images any better than the original. The best template is kept; this continues until no better template can be discovered using the current precision as a template-space operator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spatiotemporal Search</head><p>If we repeatedly apply template-space search at each instant of time, the resulting sequence of shapes is not guaranteed to be continuous, since there are many different shapes that have nearly identical silhouettes. If temporal integrity is lost, the final measurement is not reliable.</p><p>To cope with this problem, we have extended the above method using a spatiotemporal approach in which plant growth is encoded as a 4D object with time as the fourth dimension. Thus, we assume that the 3D description of the object is available at discrete points in time using the above format. As a rather extreme example, suppose we have initial and final postures (i.e., shapes of the plant) available encoded in template. We interpolate each corresponding value of the template between the initial and final shapes to generate intermediate shapes. In practice, we use more than two postures to fit a spline curve to interpolate each value in the template. This approach is equivalent to modeling using a hyperpatch.</p><p>A desirable feature of this approach is that the final growth is always continuous (i.e., no sudden change in shape), since by construction the shape varies smoothly. However, as is expected, the method tends to generate shape deformation whose error is not quite uniform over time. To overcome this point, we use a hybrid 2-step search strategy. In the first pass, we generate a spline as described above. In the second pass, we use the intermediate shapes generated in the first pass as seed templates to initiate search described in the spatial model-based approach. This approach has the effect of "snapping" the shape generated by the first pass to a shape that is much closer to true at the cost of possibly losing the continuity in shape deformation. The result of this approach is presented in the next subsection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Preliminary Results</head><p>Plate 8 contains snapshots of reconstructed stem growth. Each image was obtained by generating a polymesh and rendering with synthetic lighting. This demonstrates that once the reconstruction is complete, the researcher has access to a virtual model of the plant that can be viewed from any position.</p><p>Also, by post-processing the reconstructed model, it is possible to obtain measurements of 3D data. For instance, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref> is a plot of the hook angle (as measured on the model) versus time. Other parameters can be obtained in a similar manner.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Domain Implications</head><p>The use of the tools we have presented and others like them will have a great impact on the study of plant growth. Until now, high resolution studies have most often been done either by making simple manual measurements or by taking sequential photographs, enlarging them, and making labor-intensive manual or computerassisted measurements from the photos. Measurements of continuous growth have been done using displacement sensing transducers which provide information only on overall change in size with no information on spatial distribution of expansion. Another basis for the anticipated impact of the techniques described in this paper has to do with the increasing popularity of the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana as an experimental tool among plant biologists. This species has been selected for intense study based on its favorable genetics. However, because seedlings of this plant are very small, accurate detailed analysis of their growth will be greatly facilitated by the analysis described here (the stems in this work were Arabidopsis seedlings).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Concluding Remarks</head><p>We have described software tools that assist plant biology research. The tools are being developed for measurement and visualization of plant growth using techniques from imaging and computer graphics. Our problem is uniquely difficult, stemming primarily from the fact that the subject is quite flexible and grows in time. In this respect, our object is distinguishable from rigid bodies in motion (e.g., automobiles) or articulated objects (e.g., human figures). To cope with this situation, we have extended existing model-based approaches to handle temporal continuity.</p><p>The top-down approach with spatiotemporal models has been shown to be a promising avenue to deal with nonrigid motion. To further strengthen this approach, a bottom-up approach could be used to provide an initial configuration of the shape. Also, to deal with more complex deformation (such as development of leaves), physiological knowledge may be integrated with spatiotemporal models. We leave these research topics as our future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Oval Icon Plate 5 represents another format to show growth information.
