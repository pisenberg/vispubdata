				<p>In this paper we present a new method for auralization of the vorticity of a streamline in a vector field. This technique involves using a composite tone formed by superimposing sine waves of various amplitudes whose frequency and amplitude vary in such a way as to give the perception that the resulting sound increases or decreases endlessly in pitch without ever extending beyond the listener&apos;s range of audible frequencies. Continuous clockwise or counterclockwise rotations of a streamline resulting from vorticity can then be displayed aurally as an apparently continuous increase or decrease in pitch.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In graphical visualization of complex data sets it is often possible to overload the visual channel, either by providing too much visual information at one time (overloading the viewer's cognitive resources for visual processing) or by mapping information in such a way that information is lost in the visual form (overloading the display capabilities of the visual device). In either case, an opportunity exists for improving the understanding of the data by off-loading the visual channel and conveying some of the information through auditory means instead, a process known as auralization.</p><p>Over recent years, research into data auralization (also known as "sonification") has increased significantly, and numerous techniques have been used in various application domains for conveying qualitative and quantitative information aurally. Qualitative information is often presented in response to discrete events of interest as one of two types of short sounds known as earcons and auditory icons <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Presentation of quantitative information usually involves mapping some scalar quantity onto a particular sound parameter for a simple sound, such as frequency (pitch), amplitude, timbre, tone duration, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> Although this works well for some types of information, it works less well for others. For example, if the quantity in question represents the orientation of an object in a plane, mapping a rotational offset from a reference orientation onto a sound parameter such as pitch becomes problematic. As the object is rotated clockwise or counterclockwise, the pitch should increase or decrease.</p><p>But a problem arises when the object continues to rotate past a full 360 degrees. Either the pitch must continue in the same direction, or it must return to the starting point. The former case has the drawbacks that the pitch will eventually exceed the listener's hearing capabilities, and that different sounds are used to represent the same physical object orientation. The latter case has the drawback that a discontinuity occurs in the auditory display, with a small change in orientation resulting in a large change in pitch in the opposite direction. This paper presents a means by which this kind of information can be mapped onto sound in such a way that it does not suffer from the drawbacks previously mentioned. The technique can be used to auralize the vorticity of a streamline through a vector field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Visualization with Stream Tubes</head><p>Schroeder et. al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> describe a graphical technique for visualization of vector fields known as a stream polygon. It builds upon a streamline, a curve in a three-dimensional volume which depicts the path that a massless particle would take in the vector field. The stream polygon is a regular n-sided polygon that is swept along a streamline. The result is either a discrete series of polygons, or a continuous volume known as a streamtube. In either case, rotation of the streamtube or set of polygons is used to represent the stream vorticity, which measures the rate of angular velocity of the fluid flow at each point. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> depicts such a streamtube being used to visualize the vector field of burning fuel velocity in an aircraft engine combustor (whose wireframe outline is only partly visible due to viewing location). The streamtube was generated using the VISAGE scientific visualization system <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Visible in the image are places where the streamtube bends due to changes in the local velocity vector and places where it rotates due to fluid vorticity.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> the same streamtube is viewed from another vantage point, in which the portion containing the high degree of vorticity is obscured. This demonstrates one drawback of the technique: important aspects of the data can easily be overlooked if the image is rendered from an unfortunate vantage point, either because the object partially obscures itself, or because the object obscures, or is obscured by, other objects in the scene. This is an example of the second form of visual overloading described earlier: a 2D display device invariably requires some loss of information when that information is inherently 3D in nature.</p><p>This effect can be partly compensated for by reducing the thickness of the streamtube, but this has the disadvantage of making the vorticity harder to see due to resolution limitations. Another way around this problem is to represent vorticity as color changes along a thin streamline. Although it is not apparent in the black and white images, the VISAGE system uses color along the streamtube to represent temperature within the combustor. It would be possible to encode temperature as intensity of a particular color component, such as blue, thereby allowing the red and green components to encode vorticity magnitude and direction. But then it becomes difficult to visually segregate the individual components from the composite color, resulting in the first form of visual overloading described earlier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Fooling the Ear</head><p>Deutsch describes a perceptual anomaly in the human auditory system that involves an ambiguity that occurs when a listener is presented with a certain combination of sounds of varying pitch <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The "pitch" of a sound can be thought of as consisting of values along two orthogonal dimensions, known as pitch class and pitch height. Pitch height is an indicator of which octave a tone occurs in, whereas pitch class refers to the tone's position within an octave.</p><p>Musicians denote different pitch classes with letters from A through G, interspersed with sharps and flats. But the pitch class dimension is actually a continuum of values, not merely the discrete set of twelve semitones commonly used in musical compositions. This continuum of pitch classes is topologically a circle, with the notes A through G located at specific positions along this circle, and with G followed by A.</p><p>By combining sinusoidal waves of equivalent pitch class but different pitch height, one can construct tones that appear to have a definite pitch class but whose pitch height is ambiguous. Shepard first demonstrated this with a series of such tones, generated by a computer, which appears to ascend endlessly <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Deutsch also describes a paradox, called the "tritone paradox", in which two tones on opposite sides of the pitch class circle (i.e. tones separated by six semitones, or a "tritone") have completely ambiguous relative pitch <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. That is, some people judge the first to be higher than the second, while others judge the second to be higher than the first.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Vorticity Auralization</head><p>Since the pitch class dimension consists of values along a circular continuum, it provides us with a natural mapping of streamtube rotation onto sound. Different rotational offsets of a streamtube from a starting orientation can be represented by tones of different pitch class. With this information presented aurally, large self-obscuring streamtubes can be replaced with simple streamlines, permitting simultaneous viewing of other objects in the scene, or even of multiple streamlines. Before discussing the specific requirements of vorticity mapping, let's first look at how one can create a tone that appears to ascend or descend endlessly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Creating the Illusion</head><p>Although Shepard gives complete equations for generating the set of complex tones, we did not have Shepard's work available to us at the time we prototyped the technique, and therefore our equations are not quite the same. One subtle difference is that his equations are expressed in a form convenient for producing a discrete sequence of complex tones, whereas we sought to produce a continuously varying tone with which to map continuously varying rotational offsets. Another distinction is in the choice of mapping from frequency to amplitude. An overview of the reasoning by which our equations were derived may be worthwhile.</p><p>It is not difficult to imagine what the requirements must be of a composite tone that appears to ascend endlessly. We already know that it should move forward in the pitch class circle but contain ambiguous pitch height. A tone with a definite pitch class but ambiguous pitch height would need to be comprised of a summation of component tones, each a harmonic of a fundamental frequency identifying the pitch class.</p><p>In practice, however, it is not necessary for the tone to have a specific pitch class. Rather, all that is necessary is that incremental changes in all of the components be perceived as getting higher or lower, and that the component tones produce a pleasant sounding (or at least non-irritating) combination. In light of this, it is not necessary that the frequency ratio between successive components be equal to two (i.e. one octave). Ratios of 3/2, 4/3, and 5/4 yield agreeable results. These are roughly equal to the ratios of notes in the chords C-G, C-F, and C-E, respectively.</p><p>In order to produce an incremental increase in the apparent pitch, each component tone would have to increase by some constant factor. Also, after several incremental increases in the frequency of each component, we want to be able to return to the sound with which we started without causing any discontinuities. This requirement implies that the lowest frequency component must start off with zero amplitude and that the highest frequency component must decay to zero amplitude as the frequency of each component approaches the original frequency of the next higher frequency component. Additionally, we want the component tones in the middle of the frequency range to have the highest amplitude.</p><p>One way to achieve these goals is to have the entire range of frequencies be mapped on a logarithmic scale to the range of 0 to π and let the sine of the result be the amplitude of the component tone. This relationship of amplitude as a function of frequency is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, in which the components of a particular tone (in this case, there are four of them) and an incrementally higher pitch tone are shown as vertical lines positioned at the frequency of each component with a height equal to the amplitude of that component.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Mapping the Vorticity</head><p>As can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, as the vertical lines move to the right, they arrive at a configuration equal to that at which they started. Since the same holds true for an object as it is rotated through 2π radians, it is natural to map this range of rotation onto the range of motion of the vertical lines representing the sound components. Mapping streamline vorticity onto sound then becomes straightforward: for a given streamline or streamtube orientation θ (i.e. rotational offset from a starting orientation), determine the fraction of the "distance" (in the frequency domain) between successive sound components that each component must be shifted. Then determine the frequency and amplitude of the sound component at that location.</p><p>To determine the actual frequency and amplitude of each tone, several parameters must be chosen. These are the ratio R of frequencies between successive tone components, the base frequency of the first component (BF 0 ), and the number of components (n) comprising the sound.</p><p>The base frequency (corresponding to θ=0) of each of the n components is given in terms of the base frequency for the first component (component number zero) as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">BF i = BF 0 × R i 0≤i&lt;n (1)</formula><p>The frequency of each component as a function of θ is computed from its base frequency in a similar fashion:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F i = BF i × R (θ/2π) 0≤i&lt;n, 0≤θ&lt;2π (2)</formula><p>As can be seen from Equation 2, the component frequencies range from BF 0 to BF 0 ×R n . A given component's frequency within this range determines its amplitude. As can be see in <ref type="figure">figure 3</ref>, a given component's frequency is determined by its "distance" from the left edge of the curve, which is the ratio of that component's frequency to the first base frequency. This distance is a fraction of the entire width of the curve, which is the number of components times the width of each component. These observations yield the relationship given in Equation 3.</p><p>(3) Equation 3, however, can be simplified by substitution of terms defined in equations 1 and 2, resulting in this more compact form: <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> These equations describe the relationships between amplitude, frequency, and rotational offset due to vorticity. However, in an actual implementation, one would want to vary the frequency and amplitude of the components continuously on a per-audio-sample basis to provide a smoothlyflowing sound. In such a case, it would not be desirable to compute the amplitude and frequency in precisely the manner specified by these equations, and it is not necessary to do so. Rather, it is possible to compute some of these values incrementally, by precomputing the appropriate factor by which to multiply a particular component's frequency from one audio sample to the next, as shown in the pseudocode given in figure 4. It is therefore possible to generate the necessary waveforms in real time with modest CPU power.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>This paper presents a technique for auralization of vorticity along a streamline. The technique was implemented on a Sun SPARCstation 20 using 8-bit, 8000 samples-per-second audio hardware, with streamline vorticity information generated from the VISAGE scientific visualization system <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Preliminary observations indicate that the technique is effective at conveying orientation changes through pitch changes. Although the first application of the</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">A i π F i BF 0 ⁄ ( ) log n R log --------------------------------     sin = A i π i θ 2π ( ) ⁄ + n --------------------------     sin =</formula><p>technique was in the area of computational fluid dynamics, the idea can be applied in principle to the auralization of any kind of scalar data that obeys modular arithmetic, or any kind of scalar data for which representing changes in value are more important than representing the actual values themselves.</p><p>There are, however, limitations to the effectiveness of the tones in maintaining the illusion. If the tone sequence progresses around the pitch class circle at too fast a rate, say, faster than two or three seconds per cycle, the periodicity of the cycling becomes too apparent. When this happens, the illusion of monotonic pitch increase is hampered. As a result, auralizations of streamlines with high vorticity must proceed slowly along the streamline. Shepard noted a similar requirement, discovering that 0.84 second delays in between tones in his discrete sequence were necessary to preserve the illusion. He remarked parenthetically that it may be the deceleration of the cycling rate resulting from the delays, rather than the delays themselves, that preserves the illusion. This would more closely reflect our observation.</p><p>Although the complex tones sound more pure when the component frequencies are separated by an octave, the effect still works, as mentioned earlier, when simple ratios smaller than two are used. One advantage of using smaller ratios is that the entire tone can occupy a smaller portion of the entire audible spectrum. This leaves room in the spectrum for other purposes. Perhaps more than one set of tones can be played and interpreted simultaneously, allowing auralizations along two streamlines at once. Or perhaps other completely different auralization techniques can be applied to other scalar data sets that don't require the illusion of monotonic progression. We have not yet attempted to determine whether multiple instances of the illusion can be effectively presented simultaneously, nor have we investigated the question of how much information we can convey through the aural channel in general, but these are questions that may be worthy of further research.</p><p>At present, the technique is not implemented as part of a comprehensive visualization system, but rather exists as a stand-alone application that generates auralizations offline. For maximum utility, the technique should be incorporated into an interactive tool that provides users with simultaneous auralizations and visual animations. In the future, testing will be done with engineers who use visualization tools to understand fluid flow. This will help to determine the degree of effectiveness of the technique for conveying information and enhancing visualization. It will also provide valuable feedback for improving the use of the technique. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .Figure 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Streamtube in engine combustor showing vorticity Streamtube with high vorticity component partially obscured</figDesc></figure>
