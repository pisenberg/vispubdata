				<p>We study the topology of second-order symmetric tensor fields. Degenerate points are basic constituents of tensor fields. They play a role similar to critical points in vector topology. From the set of degenerate points, an experienced researcher can reconstruct a whole tensor field. In this paper, we address the conditions for the existence of degenerate points and based on these conditions we predict the distribution of degenerate points inside the field. Every tensor can be decomposed into a deviator and an isotropic tensor. A deviator determines the properties of a tensor field, while the isotropic part provides a unifrom bias. Deviators can be threedimensional or locally two-dimensional. The triple degenerate points of a tensor field are associated with the singular points of its deviator and the double degenerate points of a tensor field have singular local 2-D deviators. This provides insights into the similarity of topological structure between first-order(or vectors) and second-order tensors. Control functions are in charge of the occurrences of a singularity of a deviator. These singularities can further be linked to important physical properties of the underlying physical phenomena. For example, we show that for a deformation tensor in a stationary flow, the singularities of its deviator actually represent the area of the vortex core in the field; for a stress tensor, the singularities represent the area with no stress; for a Newtonian flow, compressible flow and incompressible flow as well as stress and deformation tensors share similar topological features due to the similarity of their deviators; for a viscous flow, removing the large, isotropic pressure contribution enhances dramatically the anisotropy due to viscosity.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Introduction</head><p>Tensor data sets are at the heart of many engineering and physical disciplines. Yet very few methods have been developed to understand and visualize such data sets due to their complex nature and their large size, usually derived from either experiments or numerical simulations. Therefore, there is a substantial motivation to find efficient methods for analyzing and displaying them.</p><p>The concept of critical points in vector fields have been well studied and proven to play a very important role in vector topology. Similarly, degenerate points in tensor fields are the basic constituents of tensor topology. A thorough study of the behavior of a tensor field in a close neighborhood of its degenerate points can lead to a simple topological skeleton that connects these points. Because the integral lines of eigenvectors (or hyperstreamlines) in a tensor field never cross each other, except at degenerate points, one can reconstruct the whole tensor field based only on a small fraction of the data set. In this manner, we are able to compress the data substantially with no information loss, but it should be noted that this compression is different from the usual approach used in computer science. Also, by displaying only the topological skeleton, we can avoid the visual clutter yet still reveal the essential features of the field.</p><p>Previous research efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> have shown a striking similarity between the topology of first-order(vector) and second-order tensor fields. One wonders why a point with the same eigenvalues in a tensor field behaves in a similar fashion to a singular point(a point where the magnitude vanishes) in a vector field. In this paper we explain this similarity.</p><p>Because of the extreme importance of degenerate points to tensor analysis, the conditions for the existence of degenerate points are presented here. From these conditions, one can predict the shape of this point set and construct the representation of the 3-D tensor field.</p><p>Every tensor field can be decomposed into a deviator and a spherical part (definitions to follow). The spherical part is an isotropic tensor and therefore remains invariant to a coordinate system transformation. As a result, there is no particular need to study this part of the tensor. (here we refer to it as "the isotropy tensor"). It will be shown that the deviator of a tensor is parallel to the tensor itself. Therefore, their respective eigenvector fields are identical. Furthermore, the locations of the respective degenerate points are also identical. This, in turn, means that the topology of a tensor field is identical to the topology of its deviator.</p><p>In previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the authors presented a method for locating isolated degenerate points. However, degenerate points of dou-ble degeneracy may appear along lines or surfaces. In this paper the concept of a "control function" of a deviator is proposed. This function determines the existence of degenerate points and assists in defining the lines and surfaces along which the degenerate points lie. Following the study of the tensor field in the neighborhood of degenerate points, one can display a full representation of the 3-D tensor field.</p><p>Finally, the paper presents examples where degenerate points have a very important physical interpretation such as stress free point in a 2-force Boussinesq problem and the vortex core in a rotational flow.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Critical Points</head><p>Critical points are the only points in a vector field where tangent curves may cross each other. They are characterized according to the behavior of nearby tangent curves. A particular set of tangent curves which end on critical points are of special interest because they define the skeleton which characterizes the global behavior of all other tangent curves in the vector field.</p><p>A first order critical point can be classified according to the eigenvalues of its Jacobian matrix. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> A positive or negative real part of an eigenvalue indicates a repelling or attracting nature, respectively . The imaginary part denotes circulation about the point. Accordingly, the critical points can be classified as an attracting node, a repelling node, an attracting focus, a repelling focus, a center or a saddle.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Definitions</head><p>This section contains definitions of basic terms that are used in the paper. The following section includes explanations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 1 (Singular Point) A singular point in a tensor field is a point where all eigenvalues of a tensor vanish, in mathematical representation, it is a zero matrix.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 2 (Deviator) A tensor is a deviator D iff it is trace free,</head><p>T race D = 0 , Definition 3 (Isotropic Tensor) A tensor is isotropic iff Uij = ij , where is a stretch factor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Decomposition of a Tensor Field</head><p>A tensor field in the real physical world is often very complex, therefore reducing it into a simpler form becomes very appealing. In this paper, the tensor is decomposed into a "deviator" and an "isotropic tensor" at each point in the tensor field.</p><p>Any given tensor T, can be decomposed into 1 : </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T11 x</formula><p>where D11 +D22+D33 = 0 and U11 = U22 = U33 at any point in the field.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Here Dii = Tii , 1 3 P 3 j=1 Tjj and Uii = 1 3 P 3 j=1 Tjj.</formula><p>We denote the deviator by D and the isotropic tensor by U.</p><p>A tensor can also have a "local 2-D deviator". Any given tensor can be transformed into a space in which at least one axis and one eigenvector are along the same direction, and we denote this eigenvector byẽ3. In the plane perpendicular toẽ3, the tensor is locally 2-D. It takes the form: Proof. Let T be a symmetric tensor, it can be decomposed into a deviator D and an isotropic tensor U (see equation 4). Let be an eigenvalue of D,ẽ be the corresponding eigenvector, and let = 1 3 P 3 j=1 Tjj be an eigenvalue of U, then Dẽ = ẽ and since U has three identical eigenvalues Uẽ = ẽ. Adding these two equations results in the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Tẽ = D + Uẽ = + ẽ (5)</formula><p>1 the analysis and examples in the rest of the paper are all for 3-D space, but the theory holds for 2-D space as well Therefore,ẽ is also an eigenvector of T, i.e., T and D have the same set of eigenvectors. This is a general proof. For a 2-D tensor field, the eigenvalue = 1 2 P 2 j=1 Tjj and the rest of the proof is the same.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Physical Meaning of a Deviator And an</head><p>Isotropic Tensor</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Isotropic Tensor</head><p>Based on the previous section, one can see that the tensor U is an identity tensor multiplied by Uii. Therefore, at any given location in the field, it behaves the same in every direction, in other words, it is an isotropic tensor. Since it is isotropic throughout the whole field, it is of no particular physical interests to the following study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Deviator</head><p>The deviator, in contrast to the isotropic tensor, has a different behavior in all 3principaldirectionsexceptatasingularpointwhere</p><p>all of its components are zero. It is indeed the deviator that represents the deviations from the originally isotropic field and makes the entire tensor field so complex and diverse. It is then reasonable to think of a real tensor field as a deviator superimposed onto an isotropic tensor. By subtracting the contribution of the isotropic tensor from the tensor field, the deviator becomes dominant and it enables us to clearly show the topology and the fluctuations of the field without the disturbance of the sometimes dominant isotropic contribution. One can think of this as a way to reduce the effect of the constant background, while making the variations from constancy more pronounced. The major focus is then on the deviator, as all the following sections are dedicated to the analysis of the topology of the deviator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Control Functions of the Singular Points</head><p>The 3-D tensors we are considering here have the mathematical form of a matrix, and one can find the eigenvalues of such a tensor by investigating its characteristic equation. In the case of the deviator:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">, D11 ,D12 ,D13 ,D12 , D11 ,D23 ,D13 ,D23 , D33 = 3 + a 2 + b + c (6)</formula><p>where:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">a = D11 + D22 + D33 (7) b = D11 D12 D12 D22 + D11 D13 D13 D33 + D22 D23 D23 D33 (8) c = D11 D12 D13 D12 D22 D23 D13 D23 D33<label>(9)</label></formula><p>One can see that the coefficients a; b and c are all tensor invariants.</p><p>By definition, D 11 + D 22 + D 33 = 0 , and therefore, a = 0 .</p><p>The coefficient b can be also presented as: </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">b = , 1</formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">3 + b + c = 0 .</formula><p>The standard form for the roots of this cubic equation is: Proof. If a tensor T is of triple degeneracy, then T and its isotropic tensor U are identical. Therefore, its deviator D = T , U = 0, or D is singular; On the other hand, if D is singular, then T = D + U = T.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">1 = 3 q , c 2 + p + 3 q , c 2 , p 2 = ! 3 q , c 2 + p + ! 2 3 q , c 2 , p 3 = ! 3 q , c 2 , p + ! 2 3 q</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 3 A tensor is of double degeneracy iff its deviator is nonsingular and one of its local 2-D deviators is singular.</head><p>Proof. If a tensor T is of double degeneracy, let its eigenvalues be and 3 , then it has one distinct eigen directionẽ 3 associated with 3 . We rotate the coordinate system so that one axis is alongẽ 3 . In the transverse plane, the tensor T' is locally 2-D and degenerate, therefore, it is identical to its isotropical tensor U' and its deviator D'(also a local 2-D deviator of T) is singular. However, if the deviator D of T is singular then from Theorem 2, T has to be of triple degeneracy. Since T is only of double degeneracy, D must be nonsingular.</p><p>On the other hand, if one of its local 2-D deviators D' is singular, then the local 2-D tensor T 0 = U 0 and T is degenerate. Since the deviator D is nonsingular, from Theorem 2, T is not of triple degeneracy. Therefore, T must be of double degeneracy.</p><p>Singular points are the basic constituents of both vector fields and deviators. A singular deviator can be related to a vector with three zero components. It is natural to see the resemblance between them in topology. Since a tensor and it's deviator have the same set of eigenvectors and their degenerate points occur at the same place, they share the same topological structure. This is why the topological structure of a first-order tensor(vector) and a second-order tensor field have such a striking similarity. In fact, although a secondorder field is more complex than a first-order field, because the eigenvector fields of a second-order tensor field has sign indeterminacy, it usually has an even simpler structure.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">Applications</head><p>The following section contains examples of application using the methods discussed in this paper applied to problems of scientific interest. We use both texture mapping and hyperstreamlines for display. A hyperstreamline is a trajectory that traces along the longitudinal eigenvector field while stretching in the transverse plane under the combined action of the two transverse eigenvectors. We refer to hyperstreamlines as "major", "medium" or "minor" depending on the longitudinal eigenvector field that defines its trajectory <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>The first two example refer to the deformation tensor. In the case of incompressible flow the deformation tensor, defined as Def = @ u i @ x j + @ u j @ x i , has a zero isotropic part and therefore is equal to its deviator.</p><p>For compressible flow, the deformation tensor is composed of a deviator superimposed on a non-zero isotropic tensor which represents the rate of expansion. Therefore, a deviator describes the topological structure for both incompressible and compressible flows.</p><p>For a rotational flow, inside the vortex core, flow is pure rotational. Assume that the flow advances in the zdirection and rotates around the z-axis while the velocity within the vortex core area is ,!y;!x;0(where ! is the angular velocity) and its deformation tensor Def r R becomes singular; outside the vortex core, the velocity is , r 2 ,y;x;0 and its deformation tensor Def r R is:  of the vortex core. Studies of the alignment between vorticity and eigenvectors of the strain-rate (deformation) tensor in numerical solutions of Navier-Stokes turbulence have shown that the two principal strains with the largest absolute values (major and minor eigenvectors) lie in the equatorial plane, and the vorticity is automatically aligned to the intermediate eigenvector.</p><p>2 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 3</ref> show the texture of a flow past a wingtip for a major eigenvector field and a minor eigenvector field respectively. These two eigenvectors remain in the transverse plane perpendicular to the vortex core. Images are taken from a slice of the transverse plane along the vortex core, and the two eigenvector fields form two loci as we might expect. Color encodes the magnitude of their associated eigenvalues. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 4</ref> shows hyperstreamlines of the deformation tensor of a flow past a hemisphere-cylinder at a skew angle of incidence. There are two vortex cores in this flow. Two hyperstreamlines along the body are the medium eigenvectors and also define the direction of the vortex core. The upper ring is a minor hyperstreamline and the ring in the lower part which encloses the body is the major hyperstreamline.</p><p>Pressure in a stress tensor usually comes from outside forces acting on the medium and it can be disturbingly large compared to the friction related to the viscous flow. This makes it difficult to see the actual effect from the flow itself. The bulk viscosity is the resistance of a compressible flow to the expansion. Both these two actions form an isotropic background through the field. After subtracting the isotropic contribution from the stress tensor, the resultant, its deviator, truely reflects the nature of a viscous flow. In a Newtonian flow, the stress equals the scaled deformation tensor plus the pressure component, therefore, it behaves just like the deformation tensor of an incompressible flow. We can then pre-2 for detailed information, please see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. dict the behavior of a stress tensor very easily from a deformation tensor, or vice versa. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows the stress tensor in a flow past a hemisphere cylinder. The major tubes in front propagate along the least compressive direction. Their trajectories show how forces propagate from the region in front of the cylinder to the surface of the body. The crosssection of the tubes are circular, indicating that the pressure component is dominant. However, viscous stresses close to the body induce slightly anisotropic cross-sections. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows the viscous-stress tensor in the same flow. As expected, removing the large, isotropic pressure contribution enhances the anisotropy of the tubes' cross-sections dramatically. Colors represent the magnitudes of eigenvalues of the longitudinal eigenvectors.</p><p>Stress tensors are also prevalent in solid mechanics. Here we give an example of stress induced by two compressive forces acting on top of a semi-infinite solid. Unlike in fluid mechanics, the stress in this problem is the compression and tension inside the solid due to the two outside forces. After taking out the isotropic part, the deviator turns out to have two triple degenerate points (singular points) and a continuous set of double degenerate points with one local 2-D deviator being singular(Theorem 3). <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows the minor eigenvector field (most compressive force). The arrows represent the two forces, the two balls indicate the location of singular points. The hyperstreamlines on the top surface are the separatrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> of the singular points which describe the topological structure in their vicinity. Inside the solid, the hyperstreamlines form trisectors of double degenerate points which indicate the pattern of topological structure in the vicinity of their singular local 2-D deviators. Colors of the hyperstreamlines encode the magnitudes of minor eigenvalues. We also varied the strength of the two forces . It turns out that the stress free points move along a circle as the force ratio is varied. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11">Summary</head><p>Tensor analysis is a very important yet underdeveloped area both in visualization and physics. The sheer enormous volume of information and the multivariate nature have been the major hindrances. How to simplify the analysis and extract a small fraction of the data sets without any loss of information becomes the key issue.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a decomposition to break a tensor field into a deviator and an isotropic tensor. A deviator carries the essential information about the tensor field, and describes the same topological structure. An isotropic tensor provides extra information like pressure in a stress field or expansion of a compressible flow in a deformation tensor, it is uniform at every location in the field yet can be dominant compared to the deviator. In order to understand the nature of a tensor field, we primarily study its deviator.</p><p>The degeneracy of a deviator is also its singularity, which explains the similarity between vector and second-order tensor fields. The study of a control function sheds light on the representation of singularities in a deviator as well as in the tensor field itself.</p><p>The singularities in a tensor field often have very important physical meaning. For a deformation tensor, singularities only occur either at a vortex core or in a constant flow; for a stress tensor in solids, it is a stress free point. After <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>: stress tensor in a flow past a hemisphere cylinder at incidence being decomposed into a deviator and an isotropic tensor, a stress tensor in a compressible flow with high pressure behaves similarly to a deformation tensor of an incompressible flow. We applied our methods to several physical problems and the results are very encouraging.</p><p>For further research, it will be very interesting and useful to apply these results to actual physical applications such as vortex core detection. Also, classification of singularities in 3-D and implementation of computational methods for their representation are still topics under development. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Trisector 0 and wedge 0 points. = ad , bc and I = index. where x;y are small displacements from x0. An important quantity for the characterization of degenerate points is the quantity = ad , bc (3) The appeal of arises from being invariant under rotation. When 0 , the degenerate point has three hyperbolic sectors. The pattern of eigenvector fields corresponding to the trisector point is shown in Figure 1. When 0 ,x the degenerate point has one hyperbolic sector. The local pattern corresponds to the wedge point represented in Figures 1. The various types of degeneracies encountered in 3-D tensor fields can be divided into two main types. The first, corresponding to 1 x0 = 2 x 0 or 2 x0 = 3 x ( 1 ; 2 ; 3 are ordered in a decreasing manner), is locally 2-D, and is referred to as "double degeneracy." For example, consider a degenerate point where 1x0 = 2 x 3 x . The tensor field is degenerate in the plane orthogonal to v3x0 within which locally two-dimensional patterns such as wedge points and trisectors can occur. The second type of 3-D degeneracies, corresponding to 1 x0 = 2 x = 3 x , is a 3-D degeneracy, and is referred to as "triple degeneracy." In this case the degeneracy is global and the structure of the eigenvector trajectories in the vicinity of the degenerate point is fully three dimensional. The general structure of the eigenvectors in the vicinity of a point of triple degeneracy is based upon the fundamental 2-D degeneracies in planes defined by the 3-D tensor and its expansion in the neighborhood of x0 [2].</figDesc></figure>

It is virtually a 2-D tensor with major and minor eigenvalues having equal magnitude but opposite sign and the medium eigenvalue remains zero. The deformation tensor is discontinuous at r = R. The angles of separatrices are calculated by using the tensor in the neighborhood of the vortex core Def r R<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, it turns out that there is no real solution for the angles. This indicates that the major and minor eigenvector fields are a pair of loci in the transverse plane while medium eigenvector follows the direction</figDesc></figure>
