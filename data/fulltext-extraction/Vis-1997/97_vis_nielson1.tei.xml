				<p>Some new piecewise constant wavelets defined over nested triangulated domains are presented and applied to the problem of multiresolution analysis of flow over a spherical domain. These new, nearly orthogonal wavelets have advantages over the existing weaker biorthogonal wavelets. In the planar case of uniform areas, the wavelets presented here converge to one of two fully orthogonal Haar wavelets. These new, fully orthogonal wavelets are proven in this paper to be the only possible wavelets of this type.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In this paper we present some new Haar (piecewise constant) wavelets defined over nested triangular domains. Our target application is the multiresolution approximation and analysis of fluid flow over a spherical domain and we will show the application of these new wavelets in this context in Section 3. Even though our primary application is a spherical domain and for simplicity, our figures will be for the case of planar triangles, it should be kept in mind that the development and application is much more general. The techniques developed here apply to any triangulated manifold or surface.</p><p>The concept of the orthogonality of the wavelet basis functions is important. This relates to the ease of computation of best approximations. Fully orthogonal (or simply orthogonal) wavelets are to be preferred over the weaker biorthogonal in this regard. There do not exist orthogonal wavelets over spherical nested triangular domains (only biorthogonal) and this paper does not change that. However, the new wavelets presented here are "nearly orthogonal" in the sense that when the domain becomes planar (as spherical grids approach) the wavelets become fully orthogonal. Exactly two, planar, affine invariant, orthogonal wavelets result as limits of our nearly orthogonal wavelets and we eventually prove that these are the only planar wavelets of this type.</p><p>Often these days, papers on wavelets and multiresolution approximation and analysis will give some general basic motivation and overview. We will dispense with that here and refer the reader to anyone of the many excellent introductions currently available. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> for example. Rather, we will focus our introductory material on the case of Haar wavelets over nested triangular grids. First, some comments about the types of domains we are covering. We start with an initial triangulation of a domain of interest. This initial or base triangulation may be very simple. In the case of a planar application it may consist of a single triangle. In the case of a sphere it may consist of the eight spherical triangles with vertices on an octahedron or four spherical triangles with vertices on a tetrahedron. Each of the triangles of the base triangulation is subdivided into four subtriangles in a manner shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> by adding a vertex along each edge. Often this vertex will be the midpoint (geodesic bisector), but this need not be the case. A generic triangle of the base triangulation is denoted by T and we concentrate our attention from this level forward.</p><p>All subtriangles are denoted by n T , where n is an N-tuple made from the symbols o i j , , or k. The triangle labeling scheme that we use is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. This labeling scheme allows us to dispense with the normal data structure used to represent a triangular as the name itself allows for the determination of all neighbors. The parent We start with a function which is defined in a piecewise manner over a certain level of the nested triangular domains and we wish to find an approximation defined in a piecewise manner over the coarser, parent grid one level up. We usually think of applications starting with a rather fine resolution so that simple, piecewise constant approximation is sufficient. We want to compute this lower resolution approximation in an efficient manner and in a manner that allows the reconstruction of the original piecewise defined function. This is accomplished through a change of basis which we now illustrate by example.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">of no T , ni T , nj T and nk T is n T .

The representation of equation <ref type="formula">3</ref>is called the wavelet decomposition and from this representation, we can easily reconstruct any of the piecewise defined approximations at any level and this can be done either locally or globally. Also, from this decomposition, we can easily reconstruct the original function locally by simply adding up the terms whose support intersects the local region of interest. Other oracles can be invoked for different purposes and applications. An oracle is a means by which a certain subset of the basis functions of the wavelet decomposition are selected to form a certain beneficial approximation of the original function. Compression of the original function is a very popular application. Here a certain subset (say those with the largest coefficients) of the terms of the wavelet decomposition are maintained. If the coefficients of the discarded terms are nonzero, then there will be some loss as a result of the compression. With regard to this, the concept of orthogonality is important. Let us explain why by noting a very basic property of best approximations and orthogonal basis functions. Suppose that we wish to solve the problem of</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">∑ = − N i i i N g a F a a a 1 2 1 } , , , { min L where ) , ( 2 F F F =</formula><p>. If the basis functions are orthonormal, i.</p><p>e.    ≠</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">= = j i j i g g j i , 0 , 1 ) , (</formula><p>then the solution of (6) is easily computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∑ = = N i i i g g F G 1 ) , ( .</formula><p>Furthermore this implies that whenever you have a representation of a function of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">∑ = = K i i i g F 1 α</formula><p>where the basis functions are orthonormal, then i α must be</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">) , ( i g F</formula><p>and if we wish to compute a best approximation to F from among a subset of these basis functions, we need only keep those of interest. That is, if F is given by equation <ref type="formula">7</ref>then the solution of</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">∑ ∈ − ∈ s K i i i s i g a F K i a , min is ∑ ∈ = s K i i i g G α .</formula><p>This only works if the basis functions are orthogonal.</p><p>Biorthogonal wavelets do not utilize mutually orthogonal basis functions and so by truncating a wavelet representation, we don't necessarily get the best approximation. As long as we do the approximation so that we involve collectively all the wavelet basis functions which are not necessarily mutually orthogonal, the best approximation property holds, but if we use an oracle which does not keep this in mind, then we are not making the best use of the storage for the coefficients. For example, an approximation based upon a certain percentage of the largest coefficients of the biorthogonal wavelet decomposition will not necessarily give the best compression in the least squares sense. These observations argue in favor of fully orthogonal wavelets and wavelets which nearly achieve this ideal.</p><p>There is a second concept that is really quite important when it comes to the practical application of these techniques. This has to do with how the actual data is mapped to the names and variables used to describe and program these methods. For example suppose that we start with a triangular array of trixel data</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">N N ij j i j i F 2 , 2 , , 1 , , ≤ + = L</formula><p>and we plan to apply the wavelets described here to obtain some compression or lower resolution approximation. In order to apply these techniques, we need to make some association of the data to the subtriangle domains illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. There are six possible ways of making this association with each being an affine map of the other. But there is no particular reason why one would be preferred over the other. We certainly do not want the results of our wavelet decomposition and expansions to depend upon which choice is made. Therefore, it is important that our methods give the same results in any case and be invariant to these affine transformations or equivalently be invariant under the labelings used. Some authors have called this property "symmetry."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Examples Of Haar Wavelets Over Triangular Domains</head><p>Within the context that we have established here, a particular type of Haar wavelet is completely determined by the refinement equations of (4).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Application Examples</head><p>We have applied our new techniques on a variety of data sets, but some of the most interesting are for the case of a spherical domain. We present some of those results in this section. First we mention a few things about the triangular grids for a spherical domain. The construction of the grid starts with a base triangulation of the sphere. Often this is based upon the vertices of a tetrahedron (4 triangles) , octahedron (8 triangles) or icosahedron (20 triangles).</p><p>Each triangle of the base triangulation is subdivided into four triangles by bisecting the geodesic edges at their midpoints. This process is continued. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 3</ref> illustrates this process with the base triangulation being a spherical tetrahedron. Even though the triangles of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 3</ref> are drawn with straight edges, the actual triangles used for the wavelets are spherical triangles with geodesic arcs as edges. For the sphere, it is impossible to arrange for the areas of the subtriangles to be equal while in fact the areas of these subtriangles can be quite different. For example, in the first level of the case of a tetrahedron as the base triangulation vertices, the area of the center subtriangle is four times the area of the other three subtriangles! As we go deeper into the subdivision, this ratio diminishes to one. It is this aspect of spherical triangles that is exploited by the nearly orthogonal wavelets we have presented here in equations (8) and (9). Because of this significant difference in the areas for the tetrahedron at lower levels, we usually use a base triangulation that utilizes the vertices of an octahedron and this includes the examples presented here.</p><p>We have implemented the wavelets of equation <ref type="formula">7</ref>and the new wavelets of (8) and (9) and applied them to a variety of spherical data sets. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 1</ref> contains results for an example using a spherical image (discrete samples of a scalar valued function over a spherical domain). Here we took a spherical image at level 7 (32,768 trixels) and computed the wavelet decomposition and then compared the RMS errors of the approximations using 10%, 50% and 90% of the terms with the largest normalized coefficients. Most generally the nearly orthogonal wavelets out performed the wavelets of (7), but, based upon what we have observed, there does not seem to be a clear choice between the two different nearly orthogonal wavelets. So as to try and give a fair and typical report or our results, the example of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 1</ref> was selected at random from our collection of spherical image examples. The improvement of the nearly orthogonal wavelets is not as dramatically revealed with this particular example as with others.  More interestingly, we have applied our new wavelets to data consisting of a vector field defined over the sphere. In the example of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 4</ref>, we took a known vector field function and evaluated it to obtain the data. We applied the wavelet of equation (8). In the left column we show three views of the reconstruction of the wavelet decomposition using only 1% of the coefficients. This means we started with a vector valued function which had 2048 coefficients (one for each triangle). The first time we apply the decomposition equations we obtain a function which is piecewise constant over 512 triangles and plus the 1536 detail (or wavelet) functions. No information is lost, just a change of basis. The next step yields a lower resolution approximation consisting of 128 terms and 384 detail at this level plus the 1536 detail from the first decomposition step. This is continued two more times. This final expansion (of 2048 terms) is scanned and the 20 (1%) functions with the largest coefficients are summed to obtain the partial reconstruction. In the right column we show the reconstruction based upon the largest 409 (20%) coefficients. It is indistinguishable from the original function. It is interesting to note that the main features of the flow are maintained with an approximation which uses only 20 out of 2048 terms and the flow an be compressed to 409 terms (20%) with no visual loss. The graphs of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 4</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 5</ref> are computed using the tangent curve advection and topological methods described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.  In this next example shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 5</ref>, we applied the wavelets of equation (8) to some "real" data. This is data we obtained from Roger Crawfis and Nelson Max of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Actually it is simulated data resulting from a global weather model. This data represents one slice in elevation and one time step. The first column shows three different views using a topological graph of the original data. In the second column the reconstruction based upon the 3% largest coefficients is shown.</p><p>This low resolution approximation allows us to get an overview of the flow without the clutter and detail. The use of these types of models for analysis and visualization of scientific data is potentially very useful and a very exciting area of research </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>The preference for fully orthogonal wavelet approximations and their association with best approximations has been made clear. While it is impossible to define fully orthogonal Haar wavelets over nested spherical triangulations (non uniform measure in general) we have introduced two new, nearly orthogonal Haar wavelets which reduce to fully orthogonal wavelets in the case of planar (uniform measure) triangles. These new wavelets with their additional efficiency have no (or minimal, depending upon the application) additional complexity or computational costs over existing biorthogonal Haar wavelets in this context. In a future paper, we will report on the extension of these wavelets to 3D and to piecewise linear wavelets which have increased efficiency for approximating and compressing data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The Triangle Labeling Scheme for Subtriangles</figDesc></figure>
