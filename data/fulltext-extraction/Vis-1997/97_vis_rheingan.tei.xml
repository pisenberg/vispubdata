				<p>Color is widely and reliably used to display the value of a single scalar variable. It is more rarely, and far less reliably, used to display multivariate data. Dynamic control over the parameters of the color mapping results in a more effective environment for the exploration of multivariate spatial distributions. This paper describes an empirical study comparing the effectiveness of static versus dynamic representations for the exploration of qualitative aspects of bivariate distributions. In this experiment, subjects made judgments about the correspondence of the shape, location, and magnitude of two patterns under conditions with varying amounts of random noise. Subjects made significantly more correct judgements (p &lt; 0.001) about feature shape and relative positions using the dynamic representation, on average forty-five percent more. The differences between static and dynamic representations were greater in the presence of noise.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>While current visualization systems often provide an interactive environment for describing a mapping from a data set to a visual representation, they generally do not show dynamic changes to the resulting image. In these systems, interactivity generally serves as a means to the end of finding a good static data visualization. Similarly, the interactive colormap design tools of these systems are geared toward facilitating the selection or design of an appropriate colormap for a visualization.</p><p>But what if the goal of interaction with the color representation parameters were insight, rather than just a good color mapping? Just as viewing a three-dimensional object by controlling the viewpoint dynamically is more illuminating than viewing a still image or even a precomputed film loop <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Brooks77]</ref>, so dynamic interaction with a visualization can spark insights that viewing a single representation or movie loop does not. The feeling of being able to reach in and directly manipulate the representation adds an immediacy to the exploration experience. Dynamic manipulation engages the kinesthetic sense of a viewer, rather than just the visual sense. Psychological research supports the importance of dynamic control. Held and Hein <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Held63]</ref> showed that control over visual experience, rather than just the visual experience itself, is necessary for the normal development of the visual system of cats. Kittens who passively received visual stimulation never developed the ability to perform visually-guided behaviors.</p><p>I define dynamic manipulation to be distinct from interactive control. With interactive control of parameters, the displayed image is only updated periodically, such as when a button is released or a menu selection made. With dynamic manipulation, a displayed image changes as the viewer moves some continuous</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>A number of systems have been developed for the interactive design of color mappings, usually one-variable color mappings. Some of these systems appear as parts of commercially available visualization packages [Upson88, Lucas92]; others have been described in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[Robertson86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Guitard90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Rheingans90]</ref>. Researchers have established a theoretical basis for the design of color sequences. Levkowitz <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Levkowitz88]</ref> introduces the term optimal color scale to describe a scale that maximizes the total number of JNDs (just noticeable differences) while preserving a natural order. Bergman, Rogowitz, and Treinish <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Bergman95]</ref> developed a rule-based tool for suggesting a selection of color sequences appropriate to the data type and spatial frequency characteristics, the user's task, and the properties of the human perceptual system. Bivariate color mappings are less common, especially in commercial systems, but also have a rich theoretical background. Trumbo <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[Trumbo81]</ref> presented a conceptual framework for the selection and evaluation of bivariate color sequences. Robertson and O'Callaghan <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[Robertson86]</ref> address the problem of realizing Trumbo's color sequences in a perceptually uniform color space.</p><p>Other researchers have investigated the importance of dynamic control in a wide variety of settings. Shneidermann [Shneiderman83] introduced the term dynamic manipulation to describe an interaction style involving visibility of the object of interest, rapid reversible actions, and replacement of a complex command language with physical action. A research area called Dynamic Graphics <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Cleveland88]</ref> has grown out of the statistics field placing an emphasis on highly interactive displays for statistical information display. Ware and his colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Arthur93,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ware96]</ref> evaluated 3D task performance in the presence and absence of stereoscopic display and head-coupled view position. Van Damme <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[vanDamme94]</ref> compared 3D shape perception under conditions of dynamic head-coupled viewing of a stimulus with passive viewing of a moving stimulus. Smets and Overbeeke <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Smets95]</ref> compared performance of a spatial assembly task under conditions of a still camera, passive camera motion, and head-coupled camera movement. All have found dynamic control to be a powerful tool in the understanding and manipulation of information. However, most of these have limited the scope of research to dynamic control over view of the scene rather than of more general representation parameters.</p><p>Rheingans <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Rheingans92]</ref> investigated the effects of control (none, interactive, and dynamic) and update rate on understanding of quantitative bivariate socio-economic data and found that increasing control increased subject preference, accuracy, and confidence, while update rate had little effect. That experiment showed that control increased accuracy (an average of thirty-nine percent) and confidence in tasks requiring judgements about the data value at a specified position (i.e. quantitative understanding). The experiment described in this paper poses similar questions about a different type of task involving judgements of the distribution of values across the data domain (i.e. qualitative understanding). These two types of tasks have been shown to impose different requirements on a visual representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Ware88]</ref>, so confirmation that dynamic control is valuable in both situations is important.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Multivariate Representation</head><p>Multivariate data contains multiple data values for each data point. The study presented here is limited to bivariate data, that in which two variable values are available at each point. A researcher interested in understanding the spatial distribution and pattern of such a data set might explore whether the two variables seemed to be related over the data space, how the geometry of the data space affects such a relationship, and whether points of similar value form some sort of structure. Because spatial correspondence between the variables is important, a representation with both variables displayed in the same image is preferable to a representation where each variable is displayed in its own image.</p><p>The method presented here uses multivariate color mapping to represent multivariate data. Texture <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[Levkowitz91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ware92]</ref> and glyphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[Walsum96,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ribarsky94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Pickett90]</ref> have also been proposed as techniques for the display of multivariate data. These techniques can be used either alone or in combination with color mapping. Beyond the greater number of distinct values available, color has other advantages over other display parameters. For instance, data values can also be displayed using color in a smaller area than they could be using parameters such as texture or shape. This is a significant advantage in the representation of continuous data distributions, where there is a value associated with each point in the data space. Although colored regions which are too small can result in a loss of color perception, most data sets tend be fairly highly auto-correlated, resulting in effectively larger color regions as neighboring regions with similar colors merge together.</p><p>A complementary hues color scheme was used to represent bivariate distributions. Specifically, one variable was represented by shades of purple, from black for the minimum variable value to medium purple for high values. The second variable was represented in shades of the complementary green. The contributions of the two variables at each point were summed to create the representation. Each member of the set of colors used in this color scheme lies on one of two constant hue sheets in the HLS color space. The two sheets are separated by 180˚ (resulting in the complementary hues). For each sheet, lightness and saturation levels span the entire range.</p><p>This family of mappings was chosen because it satisfies Trumbo's criteria of order, separability, preservation of univariate information, and diagonality <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[Trumbo81]</ref>. Specifically, the use of complementary colors as the display parameters ensures that the displayed colors resolve into three basic perceptual classes: roughly equal magnitudes of the two variables (greys), u &gt; v (purples), and v &gt; u (greens).</p><p>This color mapping can be made dynamic by providing the user with control over the balance between the contributions of the two variables. Consider the color used to represent a pair of values (i.e. the values of the two variables at a single point) to be the weighted sum of the colors used to represent each individual value. Dynamic control allows the user to manipulate the weighting factor employed, creating a range of color mappings that emphasize the values of each variable individually as well as jointly. More detail about this mapping can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Rheingans92]</ref>.</p><p>In order to investigate the effects of dynamic control, I constructed a tool for the dynamic design and manipulation of color mappings, called Calico <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[Rheingans90]</ref>. Calico provided control over all three basic parts of the color scheme: the color model, the curve or surface formed by color scale parameters as they travel through that space, and the parameterization of the mapping from variable values to curve or sheet coordinates. Implementations of Calico were constructed on top of Pixel-Planes 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Fuchs85]</ref>, IRIS Explorer, and AVS (Application Visualization System) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[Upson89]</ref>. The experiment described below was performed using the Explorer version of Calico.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experimental Method</head><p>In this experiment, subjects made judgements about the correspondence of the shape, location, and magnitude of two patterns under conditions with varying amounts of random noise. The a priori hypotheses of this experiment were that: 1. A dynamic representation conveys information about feature shape in bivariate pattern more accurately than a static display 2. A dynamic representation conveys information about the relative positions and magnitudes of features of bivariate distributions as well as a static display.</p><p>Subjects. The sixteen subjects were volunteers recruited from among students of introductory courses in the UNC-CH Department of Computer Science. All subjects were found to have normal color vision using standard pseudoisochromatic plates <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Ichikawa78]</ref>.</p><p>Design. The experiment employed a two-factor, within-subject design, with the factors being representation type and level of noise. Two different kinds of representations were presented: a static bivariate display and a dynamic bivariate display. Subjects were randomly assigned to a representation order, with half of the representation orders presenting the dynamic representation first and half presenting the static representation first. Three levels of noise were considered: none, medium, and high.</p><p>The bivariate data set used in each trial was built from two singlevariable data distributions. Each single-variable distribution was generated algorithmically to contain one of the following Gaussian features: peak, well, saddle, ridge, or trough. These shapes correspond roughly to the three classes defined by Koenderink's shape index (convex elliptic, concave elliptic, and hyperbolic) and the boundary cases between them (convex and  Data variable values were generated on a 50 × 50 grid. This grid was rendered as a color-interpolated polygonal mesh in an 800 x 800 display window. Features were generated as Gaussian blobs (or combinations of Gaussian blobs in the saddle case). The standard deviation for peaks, wells, and across ridges and troughs was three grid units. The standard deviation along ridges and troughs was nine grid units. In order to minimize border effects, features were positioned in the center fifth of the image.</p><p>Each feature was varied according to three characteristics: 1. Shape --one of peak, well, ridge, trough, or saddle. 2. Location --position of feature center in the distribution. For peaks and wells, the feature center is defined as the extreme point. For ridges and troughs, it is defined as the middle of the crease. For saddles, the center is the saddle point. 3. Magnitude --difference between minimum and maximum value in the distribution.</p><p>Gaussian distributed noise with standard deviation of zero (no noise), ten percent of the feature magnitude (medium noise), or twenty percent of the feature magnitude (high noise) was added to each image. The medium and high levels of noise correspond to signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of approximately ten and five, respectively. Example images showing the three noise levels are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Noise had a mean value of zero, so the mean value of a distribution was not affected by the addition of noise. Each of the three noise levels was added to one third of the trials; that is, there were equal numbers of trials with each noise level.</p><p>Display. Stimulus images were displayed in an 800 X 800 pixel area centered in the top section of the screen. A prompt window containing radio buttons asked the subject questions about the feature characteristics and contained a button to signal the end of the trial. A sample display screen is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>.</p><p>Stimulus images were formed by summing the contributions of the two single-variable distributions. The two representations differed only in whether the subject could control the relative weights of the two display parameters (purple and green). Specifically, the two representations were:</p><p>1. Static bivariate image: Each pixel in this image showed the combined contributions of the two variables, weighted equally.</p><p>2. Dynamic bivariate image: Each pixel in this image showed the combined contributions of the two variables. As the subject manipulated a physical dial, the relative weights of variable contributions were changed. Consequently, the image could show just the first variable, just the second variable, or any linear combination of the two variables. This comparison of a single static image with the dynamic image was chosen for two reasons. First, single static images are the most common method of displaying multivariate data. Second, the earlier experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Rheingans92]</ref> showed both that dynamic representations are more effective than even multiple static images and that the fact of dynamic control is more important than the degree of such control. Accordingly, limiting the experiment to these two representations simplified the execution of the experiment while still making a meaningful comparison between the new technique and a more standard control technique.</p><p>Procedure. Subjects received written instructions explaining the experimental procedure and showing examples of one-variable images of the five feature shapes. In addition, subjects were shown clay models of the 3D shape equivalents. This was done because some pilot subjects had difficulty understanding the concept of shape height when shown only the 2D examples. Before each block of trials, subjects received a written description of the representation used in that block.</p><p>Each subject performed two blocks of trials, one for each representation type. Each block consisted of eight practice trials and thirty test trials. In each trial, the subject viewed (and in the dynamic case manipulated) the representation of two-variable distributions. The subject answered the following questions about the two distributions:</p><p>• What shape is represented by the purple parameter?: fivealternative forced-choice • What shape is represented by the green parameter?: fivealternative forced-choice</p><p>• Are they at the same location?: two-alternative forcedchoice • Do they have the same magnitude?: two-alternative forcedchoice</p><p>After answering the questions, subjects pressed a button to signal completion of the trial. In practice trials, the correct answers appeared in a text window. Trials were timed by the control software. After all trials were completed, the experimenter conducted a short interview with the subject about representation preferences, observations, and strategies that the subject may have used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>In all analyses, a within-subjects analysis was used. That is, the scores of a subject using one representation method were compared with the scores of that same subject using other representation methods.   Additionally, subjects' preferences for representations, strategies for task completion, and spontaneous comments were examined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Shape identification.</head><p>The number of incorrect shape identifications for each representation and noise level was recorded for each subject. The means for each treatment condition are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4a</ref>. Bars showing the mean difference between a subject's performance using the two representations is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4b</ref>. Error bars are included to show the 95 percent confidence interval for mean difference. Since this interval does not contain zero at any noise level, we reject the possibility that there is no accuracy difference between the two representations. On average, subjects gave forty-five percent more correct identifications using dynamic representations than using static. This difference is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). A p-value of this size indicates that there is a less than 0.1 percent chance that such a difference would result from chance variation. The analysis of variance is shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The analysis also showed significant effects from both noise level and the representation-noise interaction (p &lt; 0.001). Specifically, average accuracy decreased as noise increased and the accuracy difference between static and dynamic representations was greater in the presence of noise. There was little difference between the medium and high noise levels.</p><p>Inspection of the scores of individual subjects yields another interesting performance difference. Six subjects (one-third of the total) had perfect scores with the dynamic representations. That is, they correctly identified all shapes at all noise levels. No subjects had perfect scores in the presence of noise using the static representation, though one subject did have a perfect score in static trials where no noise was present.</p><p>Position comparison. The number of incorrect position comparisons for each representation and noise level combination was recorded. Only trials with matching shapes were considered. This eliminated the need for subjects to correctly identify the center points of differing shapes. The average number of incorrect position comparisons under each treatment condition is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5a</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5b</ref> shows the mean difference between a subject's performance using the two representations. Error bars are included to show the 95 percent confidence interval for mean difference. At the lowest noise level, this interval contains zero (no difference), so we cannot reject the possibility that there is no accuracy difference between the representations when no noise is present. In the presence of noise however, there does appear to be a significant difference in accuracy. Two-factor analysis of variance showed significant effects of representation, noise level, and representation-noise interaction. This analysis is shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Specifically, subjects made more correct position comparisons using the dynamic representation. This difference was larger at the highest noise level. In addition, subjects made fewer correct comparisons in the presence of noise, particularly in static trials.  why a dynamic representation should be better for position comparisons than a static one. Additional analysis suggests a possible explanation for this difference. If only trials in which the subject correctly identified the shape are considered, the effects are no longer quite statistically significant (0.05 &lt; p &lt; 0.10). See <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. This result suggests that subjects may make more correct position comparisons in dynamic trials simply because they are more likely to correctly identify the shapes and can then correctly locate the centers for comparison.</p><p>Height comparison. The number of incorrect height comparisons for each representation and noise level combination was recorded. Two-factor ANOVA showed that there is no significant difference between the two representations, and noise seems to have no effect. As expected, dynamic control neither helped nor hindered judgments about relative heights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>The analyses show that dynamic representations offer significant advantages for shape identification tasks without sacrificing accuracy in comparing heights or positions. A number of subjects commented that they saw shapes with the dynamic representation that were not visible in a static view. One said, "When you turn the knob sometimes images appear that you didn't even know were there. You could definitely get the shapes right... I just couldn't believe that some images were there that I just couldn <ref type="bibr">'</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Two-factor ANOVA of position scores for correct shape trials.</p><p>have seen --they were just so hidden." Although subjects answered position comparison questions more accurately as well, this seems to be mainly the result of more accurate shape identifications on which to base position comparisons.</p><p>Preference. When subjects were asked which representation they preferred, all but one emphatically selected the dynamic representation. One subject in particular saw an immediate difference between the representations. This subject, who used the static representation first, was verifying the instructions for the dynamic block. He asked, "So the difference is that now I can turn this knob?" Without waiting for an answer he turned the knob and said, "Oh, to see things better." The one subject who preferred the static representation said, "I liked it [the static representation] because it was more challenging."</p><p>Confidence and Ease of Use. Subjects found shape identifications much easier to make using the dynamic representation. Consequently, they felt more confident about the accuracy of their answers. One subject said, "With static a lot were guesses. I tried to think about what it looked more like. With dynamic I just switched back and forth --on about twenty-five [out of thirty] I felt sure." The difference in accuracy between the representations bears out this confidence. In contrast, although many subjects thought that heights were easier to compare using the static representation, no accuracy difference was observed.</p><p>Strategies. The comments that subjects made about the strategies they used to answer the questions illustrates the distinct natures of static and dynamic representations. Although subjects described a variety of strategies for answering questions in the trials, only a few general strategies were mentioned frequently. In static trials, subjects sometimes mentioned that they mentally constructed bivariate images from the candidate single-variable shapes. In dynamic trials, subjects generally identified shapes by turning the balance knob to its single-variable extremes. They looked at intermediate mixtures to compare heights, either trying to find the balanced image, slowly dialing from one extreme to the other, or manipulating the knob with large quick motions. Some subjects mentioned that they compared positions by watching the image change as they moved the dial back and forth. Basically, subjects took advantage of the power of dynamic control by manipulating the image in different ways to answer different kinds of questions.</p><p>Speed. With a single exception, subjects completed static trials in less time than dynamic trials, an average of twenty-five percent less time. Most subjects viewed the static image for a moment and then answered the questions as best they could. Using the dynamic representation, subjects spent additional time manipulating the image before selecting answers. The one subject who was faster in dynamic trials pondered static images for a long time as she mentally added together alternative shapes. On dynamic trials, she just quickly spun the dial to isolate the individual shapes. While it would be nice to say that dynamic representations are both better and faster than static, it seems logical that subjects spent more time on dynamic trials since there were more things they could do with them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>Dynamic control over representation parameters results in a visualization that is qualitatively different and quantitatively more powerful than static representations. Specifically, the results of the experiment showed that:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">A dynamic representation DOES convey information about</head><p>feature shapes in bivariate pattern more accurately than a static display Subjects made 49 percent more accurate shape identifications with the dynamic representation than with the static representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">A dynamic representation DOES convey information about the relative positions and magnitudes of features of bivariate distributions as well as a static bivariate displays</head><p>Subjects made similar numbers of correct magnitude comparisons with the two representations. Subjects also made significantly more correct positions comparisons, but this seems to be primarily the result of more accurate shape identifications on which to base positions comparisons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Future Work</head><p>There remains room for a variety of other experiments in order to isolate effects or generalize to a wider range of tasks, representations, data, and subject populations. Although the techniques presented here should generalize to 3D data spaces, the additional dimension brings with it additional display issues. For example, how do shading effects from surface lighting and coloring effects from pseudo-coloring interact? Are there some color mappings that work more successfully with lighted surfaces?</p><p>Can interactive control of the viewpoint be used to separate the effects of lighting and coloring?</p><p>Equally interesting is the extension of dynamic representation to the exploration of many variables (rather than just two). One possible way to explore more variables would be to look at them in sequence. In that way, a viewer can explore relationships among the entire set of variables by viewing and manipulating them pairwise. It remains to be seen how pairwise insights generalize to higher dimensional understanding. Alternatively, using a wider range of display parameters could allow more variables to be represented simultaneously, or it could make color representations more effective by introducing redundant display parameters. Together with opacity, texture shows interesting potential for data representation. It should be noted that introducing another display parameter does not necessarily introduce another independent carrier of information, since display parameters may produce cross-effects and obscure one another.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Example feature shapes.
