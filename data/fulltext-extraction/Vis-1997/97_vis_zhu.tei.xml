				<p>This paper addresses multiresolutional representation of datasets arising from a computational field simulation. The approach determines the regions of interest, breaks the volume into variable size blocks to localize the information, and then codes each block using a wavelet transform. The blocks are then ranked by visual information content so that the most informative wavelet coefficients can be embedded in a bitstream for progressive transmission or access. The technique is demonstrated on a widely-used Computational Field Simulation dataset.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Given the advances in hardware and the proliferation of new numerical and data analysis techniques, the solution grids from computational simulations are continuously becoming larger. For instance, even 100 time steps using a grid size of 69x43x15 from a computational field simulation (CFS) requires the storage of the computational grid, a vector field (velocity) and two scalar fields (density, energy) all in floating point format making the storage requirement 136 Mbytes. Therefore, it is useful for the datasets to be stored in compressed format. Both lossy and lossless schemes have been used to store datasets. The efficiency of any of these compression schemes is measured in terms of the number of bits assigned per element of the dataset. For computational field simulations it is important that any representation be inherently lossless. However, it is also imperative that the compression scheme allow for selective display of important structures in a dataset.</p><p>Similarly, the size of the datasets becomes a burden when they are transmitted over usually a slow network. It is not uncommon that a domain for a simulation is spatially divided into several zones and executed on a multicomputer or a cluster of networked processors. Each zone has its own geometric grid and a designated processor, or solver. Visualizing the solution data from the solvers in real-time or near-real-time provides instantaneous feedback and therefore allows tracking of the simulation. Such systems are becoming increasingly available <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In this case, visualization is done in a distributed manner, i.e., the solution data are transferred from the solvers to a graphics workstation over the network and selectively visualized. The advantages of progressive transmission schemes especially those afforded by multiresolutional meth-ods are well-known. A visualization is first created at a low resolution and progressively updated. Thus, the solvers constitute a continuous multi-channel, multi-resolution data source which feeds the visualizer.</p><p>A compression and progressive transmission scheme for visualization should maximize the information presented while minimizing the data rate. This problem can be explained by using an information-rate curve. If the information in a data volume is uniformly distributed over the data domain and the bit budget is uniformly allocated for each point, this curve will be linear. In most cases, however, the information contained in a dataset is non-uniformly distributed, resulting in a non-linear curve. As a result some regions of the volume face bit starvation and are not adequately represented. The desired information-rate curve should have a sharp rise as close to the zero-rate as possible, so that most of the data information could be visualized as early as possible. Also, to achieve an effective progressive transmission scheme it is important that an embedded scheme be used, where the information is ranked by significance and transmitted accordingly over the channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Moreover, CFS datasets are generally very sparse, since the computational experiment attempts to study and focus on very specific phenomenon and sometimes at very specific locations in the domain. Most of the information is packed in a very small portion of the entire volume. Thus, an embedded scheme would be ideal for visualizing CFS datasets unlike medical data sets which are more dense.</p><p>In this paper, we present a wavelet-based multiresolutional data representation scheme that has the following salient features:</p><p>• allows for lossless compression of floating point data • facilitates selective and embedded display or transmission, allowing the user to stop transmission at any desired time.</p><p>• does not require that the resolution of the source volumes be dyadic (power-of-two).</p><p>The third feature is essential for CFS datasets which come in a variety of shapes and sizes, often dictated by the underlying geometry and the desired local resolution of structures. Many multiresolutional schemes impose power-of-2 restrictions on the resolution. A commonly used solution is padding the dataset until power-oftwo resolutions are obtained. This increases the quantity of data that must be transmitted, sometimes significantly.</p><p>Our compression scheme is two-pass in nature. In the first pass, a spatial subdivision is obtained which delineates regions of high spatial frequency. The subdivision is obtained by creating a correlation mask from the dyadic wavelet transform. This step may require the padding of the of the volume. An octree embedding of this mask provides the required subdivision. In the second phase each block of the partition is coded separately using an appropriate function from a wavelet library. It is noteworthy that this step does not require any padding of the original volume. Later the wavelet coefficients in each of the blocks are sorted and packed based on the presence of significant structures. The visual content associated with coefficients within each block is estimated by employing a computational model of the Human Visual System (HVS). The final result is an embedded encoding of the volume. Thus, our method draws from results in information theory, image coding/ analysis, and low-level vision models. Our focus is not on the development of full-fledged compression scheme including quantization of coefficients. Rather, we develop a multiresolution representation scheme which can be very easily extended to lossy or lossless coding. Other papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> present the details of a plausible complete coding scheme.</p><p>In Section 2 we motivate the need for a variable block sized multiresolution representation and review past reported methods in volume compression. In Section 3 we present our scheme for multiresolution volume representation and in Section 4 we present our embedded progressive transmission scheme. Results are presented in Section 5 and in Section 6 we draw conclusions and discuss future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">WAVELET-BASED MULTIRESOLUTION REPRESEN-TATION</head><p>In this section we first describe transform coding methods especially those based on wavelets. Specifically, we describe the first and second generation coding methods and draw adequate distinctions between them. Later, reported work including methods besides wavelets will be described briefly. In this paper we use the words signal, image, and volume synonymously.</p><p>Transform Coding -Wavelet based compression methods belong to the class of Transform Coding (TC) methods. In these methods the image or volume is projected to a transformed space spanned by adequate basis functions. Thus, the original underlying signal can be written as , where the B i s are the basis functions and the c i s are the coefficients obtained as a result of the inner product of the signal with the basis functions. The most popular TC method is the discrete cosine transform (DCT). In the case of the DCT the basis functions are cosines of infinite extent. The goal of any TC method including DCT is to de-correlate the signal in the projected space so that a few coefficients can adequately represent the signal. Compression can be obtained by retaining only a portion of the coefficients. The size of the retained portion is dictated by the desired quality of the resulting image. Although efficient, the DCT does not succinctly represent perceptually important structures like corners and edges. Many non-zero coefficients are needed to represent edges with high fidelity. There exist multiresolution methods (Gaussian, Laplacian, etc.) which are implemented as pyramid transforms. These methods again do not fare well in compressing edges. However, wavelet transforms have the potential to perform this task well.</p><p>Wavelet Transform -The wavelet transform has gained much popularity due to some very attractive properties including compact support of the basis functions and the ability to represent functions of arbitrary smoothness <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. A wavelet transform <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> projects the signal into a orthogonal/biorthogonal basis space spanned by functions called wavelets. Wavelets offer useful timefrequency localization and efficient multiresolution hierarchies. The original image is split into several subimages of smaller resolutions guided by a dyadic subdivision of the frequency spectrum (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3a)</ref>. Thus at each level of the transform four subimages (LL, HL, LH, HH; L=low, H=high) are obtained, each spanning either the high or low portions of the 2D spectrum. Similarly, for</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">f c i B i x ( ) ∑ = 3D</formula><p>volumes eight subvolumes result at each level of the transform. In addition to signal de-correlation, the wavelet transform provides a natural multiresolutional data representation. The original signal can be reconstructed from coarse to fine resolutions by using incrementally more wavelet coefficients.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>[23] <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> techniques in compressed rendering in the wavelet domain are reported. The essential coefficients based on magnitude are retained. It has been shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> that an image can be suitably represented by the first N coefficients within a certain error tolerance measured in spaces spanned by smooth functions. These results although significant do not easily adapt to practical use. Methods which retain only N coefficients are often classified as first generation methods. Although, much progress has been made in the field of coding, general purpose techniques are still lacking <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Much information in an image is concentrated in a few regions. These are dominated by structures characterized by discontinuities in intensity and manifest as edges (images) and boundaries (volumes). As pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, second generation methods are driven by structures in an image. Moreover, it is essential that a human observer or a model of the HVS be included in the coding scheme. Edge detection and representation with edges have been used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Maximas are searched for in a multi-dimensional scale space created by a wavelet transform resulting in the generation of multiscale edges. However, it is often the case that texture is not preserved. Also, search-based approaches for identifying edges are cumbersome especially for 3D volumes. Finally, edge based methods suffer from the disadvantage of being error prone in the presence of noise. General structure-extraction coding methods exist and they attempt to segment an image into edge and texture regions. The edge image is coded with high-accuracy and the texture is coded with very low bit rate. Although satisfactory, the compression ratios obtained are not significantly large. Higher order methods which attempt to capture the correlation of the signal across scales are still needed. A significant method, wavelet probing, was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> to segment the image into smooth regions which are coded very efficiently. The identified edge regions are then coded separately by employing the same technique. Although the method may yield high coding efficiency, it is not suitable for embedded coding, since the coefficients are not assigned edgebased significance.</p><p>Since the wavelet transform is performed using a single mother wavelet, the transform is essentially signal independent. To adapt to the statistical properties of the data, wavelet packet techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> decompose the signal by choosing from a library of wavelet packets the wavelets that best represent the signal. Essentially a KL-transform is performed on the image which is inherently expensive. Several extensions and improvements have been proposed to the basic algorithm which attempt to expedite the procedure of finding the best basis <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. However, the computational expense is still staggering. An aspect of the wavelet packet transform however is amenable for use. Spatial subdivision of the image is conducted and normally a quad-/octree is used in conjunction with the subdivision of the frequency bands. Each block ensuing from the spatial subdivision can be coded with a different wavelet basis, the choice being dictated by a variety of reasons including measures of function smoothness.</p><p>Spatial subdivision has been used in compression techniques other than TC methods. For instance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> a quadtree was used to first segment the image. Later each block was subjected to an application of vector quantization (VQ) algorithm. The spatial subdivision can also be conducted in the wavelet domain with the intent of locating significant regions. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> a zerotree wavelet structure is created from the wavelet space. This allows for a grouping of wavelet coefficients of similar significance in a hierarchical fashion and facilitates an embedded representation that is well suited for progressive transmission. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> this technique was expanded to include a computational model of the HVS.</p><p>Our method uses a spatial subdivision method in the wavelet domain. We also allow embedded coding and employ a method developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>[36] to locate the significant structures of a volume. Then, the spatial domain is decomposed into blocks, with each block being coded independently. Finally, an ordering is done in a linear fashion among all the blocks. We describe our method in greater detail in Section 3 and Section 4. In the following section we briefly review previous work in volume coding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Related Work</head><p>Previous volume compression methods include predictive methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, fractal methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, vector quantization <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, DCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, wavelets <ref type="bibr">([13]</ref>[23] <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>), and gaussian pyramids <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The predictive method (followed by Huffman coding) reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> provided sufficient improvement over the standard UNIX utilities like gzip, but did not provide a high level of compression. Also, it was not amenable to embedded coding for progressive transmission. Ning and Hesselink <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> used VQ to compress volume data and achieved a high level of compression. However, the method is not again very amenable to progressive transmission given the asymmetric nature of the coder and decoder. The coding effort is generally orders of magnitude higher than expended in the decoding component. The fractal technique of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> is expensive and is not amenable to progressive transmission. Among the transform cod-ing methods the DCT, wavelet, Gaussian and Laplacian image pyramids have found common use. However, the work reported in both <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> emphasizes less the compression aspect and more the rendering of images from the compressed domain. There exist other methods which have been borrowed from image coding and are suitable for hardware implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Other wavelet methods reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>[28] <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> belong to the first generation class; the compression schemes used therein do not adapt to structures in the datasets. Rather, they apply standard and computationally viable techniques for compression and transmission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">A VARIABLE-BLOCKSIZE VOLUME COMPRESSION ALGORITHM</head><p>The volume representation scheme reported herein has the four components shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The block representation allows for the ranking and measurement of important information in a signal. The progressive transmission scheme requires another component to order the blocks (Section 4). The first three components facilitate the detection of significant structures while the fourth component achieves the actual coding. We now describe each component in detail.</p><p>Wavelet Transforms -We use the orthogonal wavelet transform to obtain the mask and the biorthogonal wavelet transform to code the image in each block. The Daubechies filter of length 8 was used for the first task while the second task employed second order spline wavelets. The chosen length of 8 for the Daubechies filter suffices since it can represent fourth degree polynomial functions accurately which can suitably describe all practical images and volumes. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> a study of different biorthogonal wavelets for coding efficiency is conducted. Our choice of the second wavelet was dictated by that study. We chose the biorthogonal filter of second order since it provides adequate results.</p><p>The reported method should work for all images with any resolution. However, its functioning depends on the partition of the image into regions which are then coded individually. The partitioning is achieved through a dyadic wavelet transform. Padding is required for resolutions which are not powers-of-two. Once the partition is obtained the additional regions are no longer considered and only the original volume is considered. In either case, the dyadic wavelet transform is conducted through the pyramid scheme of Mallat <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> by the repeated application of a pair of suitable low-and bandpass filters. More details on the wavelet transform can be found in much reported work including <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. It now remains to identify the coefficients which contribute to structures in an image.</p><p>Structure Detection -We use a wavelet based analysis algorithm that locates significant structures which persist across the scales of the wavelet decomposition. As a result of the induced subdivision of the frequency spectrum of the image, the image is now decomposed into a pyramid consisting of bandpass images. A denoising stage follows which allows for thresholding of the coefficients at separate levels based on a noise model, e.g., Gaussian <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The subband images are then combined through a process of multiplication to yield a correlation mask of the same size as the image. If a redundant transform is used then no interpolation of the subband images is needed, however, for the orthogonal wavelet an interpolation step is required. If the mask at any location is set to zero, it implies that no scale coherent structures persist at that point. Wherever the mask is set to zero, the corresponding coefficients in the pyramid are set to zero. An image and the associated mask are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. As a result of this structure-based thresholding operation only the coefficients contributing to coherent features remain. The mask generation can be iterative allowing for more coefficients to be neglected. The 3D subband combining algorithm is similar to the ones presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>[27] <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> uses the sum of binary thresholded wavelet coefficients. However, the algorithms in both <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> attempt to detect correlated structures across the scales by employing the product of the wavelet transform. It can be easily shown that the product is more effective since it arises naturally from the shape of the wavelet transform which is in the form of a cone <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> the emphasis is on denoising and detecting edges, while in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> the algorithm identifies structures of arbitrary singularity and assigns pixel-wise saliency values in regions populated by singular structures. The correlation mask has been used to enhance structures in images <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and towards the development of image comparison metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. We are exploring its use in volume compression in this paper.</p><p>Octree Subdivision of the Mask -The spatial subdivision allows the identification of coherent and similar regions in the image. Several options exist including region growing and recursive spatial decomposition methods. Region growing algorithms although useful are not very amenable to user control and can result in blocks of odd shape and size and hence we resort to recursive spatial subdivision methods based on quad-/octrees. The level of the tree is controlled by the user thus producing square/cubic blocks. Otherwise, a crude homogeneity measure can be employed to control the subdivision process. We show the spatial subdivision obtained using a slice of the data in <ref type="figure">Figure 2a</ref>. There will be some blocks which do not carry any information; they arise in the proximity of the discontinuities. In the following section we describe how the wavelet coefficients in the blocks can be packed for progressive transmission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">PROGRESSIVE TRANSMISSION</head><p>In this section we describe the packing of data for progressive transmission. The blocks obtained from the spatial subdivision of the mask are sorted based on the information content within each block. A single bitstream is created from the wavelet transform coefficients of the partitioned blocks for transmission or storage. The rationale behind this scheme is to insert the most vital information at the beginning of the bitstream. Such a scheme then allows for transmission until the desired target rate is achieved. The information content can be measured in a variety of ways including the mean-square error. However, the MSE is not a viable measure of saliency in an image <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Rather, a weighted MSE based on perceptual considerations is gaining much popularity and is being used in image coding extensively <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. The resulting bitstream is constructed from coefficients obtained from blocks in an order determined the presence of significant structures.</p><p>We now describe the Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) and show how it can be used to determine the perceptual saliency.</p><p>Human Visual System -The human cortex is often modeled as a linear system and its response to a visual excitation in the receptive field is expressed as a convolution of the impulse response of the visual cortex with the input stimulus. Equivalently, the response to an input can be obtained by multiplying the Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) with the Fourier transform of the input. The CSF measures the response of the visual system to different frequencies. It is important to note that the response is lower for higher frequencies. Attempts have been made to measure the CSF of the human visual system. For instance, Mannos and Sakrison <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, after conducting a series of psychophysical experiments on human subjects, found that the CSF can be modeled by the function in Equation 1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3a)</ref>. Here, f s is spatial frequency in cycles per degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(1)</head><p>A 2D (or a 3D) version can be easily obtained and is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3b</ref>). The discrete orthogonal wavelet transform does not serve as a computational model for the HVS. To include the CSF into our methods, a frequency decomposition induced by a dyadic wavelet transform is imposed on the CSF <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3a)</ref>. Thus, for each band a weight can be computed which is then applied to the wavelet transform. The coefficients at each level and location are modulated using a perceptual weight obtained by integrating the CSF over the area occupied by the band in a 3D frequency space. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3a</ref> shows the CSF function mapped to image frequency and the superimposed wavelet transform subdivision in 1D. Thus, after m iterations of the wavelet transform the weight for level m is: <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> where FB m is the frequency subband in question. This weight measures the area of the CSF curve in each octave band <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3a)</ref>. The weights are precomputed and stored in a table. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4b</ref> we show the normalized weights for a 2D subdivision <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The weights can be used to provide importance to wavelet coefficients within each block. We employ a 3D version of the CSF to code a </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">- = C m CSF ω ( ) ω d FB m ∫         ω d FB m ∫         ----------------------------------------------FB m , π 2 m ------- π 2 m 1 - ---------------- ,       = =</formula><p>given volume. In reality, there is no physical justification for such a function. However, it is not uncommon to employ modulation transfer functions (MTF) to alter the significance of coefficients in a transformed space. Thus, we can conceivably construct a device which accentuates frequencies in the central portion of a 3D spectrum. To avoid necessary confusion we, however, use the terms CSF and MTF synonymously. We now show how the perceptual weight can be incorporated into a packing scheme.</p><p>Perceptual Weighted Embedded Packing Scheme -The following scheme is designed to select the next significant coefficient based on the structure information estimated in each block. As a result a wavelet coefficient bitstream is constructed with the coefficients carrying the most information being placed in the stream as early as possible. After data partitioning, the data volume is represented by N variable-size blocks, B i ,</p><p>. Each block B i has the following entities:</p><p>• The starting spatial address (i,j,k) and the block size.</p><p>• The information quantity contained in the block, H i , which is defined as the sum of all correlation mask values contained in the block.</p><p>• The wavelet coefficients computed for the data block.</p><p>The measurement of the information in a block does not have to be exact. As long as H i is a monotonic function it will suffice. Since the mask is created from the product and non-linearly enhanced with a logarithm function, H i will be monotonic. Blocks of the same size will have the same CSF weight but different H i s. Thus the visual significance of a wavelet coefficient is a relative quantity and is determined by two factors:</p><p>• the quantity of information in the block to which the wavelet coefficient belongs, namely H i</p><p>• the position of the wavelet coefficient inside the block.</p><p>During embedding, the relative significance of the blocks and coefficients has to be constantly updated. To do so, we calculate for each block RH i , the remaining information, using a CSF which is pre-computed for each possible block size. This function should have the following properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> where N i is the number of coefficients in a block.</p><p>Thus, a 2k x 2k x 2k block will have 8k <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> coefficients, each measuring the information available in a subband. In the case of a 2-level, 2D wavelet transform, the dyadic decomposition results in the subdivision shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. Thus each band in the dyadic decomposition is pre-computed and assigned a value, i.e., each position in the block (i,j,k) is assigned a normalized weight NCSF(i,j,k) (prefix N indicating normalization). A possible candidate for the function RH is <ref type="formula">4</ref>The function RH essentially computes the perceptual information that can still be assigned to the block after m coefficients have been embedded. When a coefficient is embedded in the bitstream the corresponding normalized weight is subtracted from value of RH. The coefficients inside a block are selected in a zig-zag order similar to the selection scheme in JPEG <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Once a coefficient is embedded, the corresponding perceptual weight is subtracted. This scheme distinguishes between blocks that have the same spatial dimension but different information content. Given our octree spatial subdivision of the original domain, several such similar sized blocks can exist, some with little information. The packing algorithm can be summarized as follows:</p><p>Step 1: Sort the blocks in descending order, using H i as the key.</p><p>Step 2: Insert into the bitstream the lowest subband coefficient for each block and update RH i accordingly. Re-sort the blocks based on RH i .</p><p>Step 3: Insert into the bitstream coefficients (determined by the Z patterns) from the first block in the sequence and update RH i until the first block is no longer the most significant block.</p><p>Step 4: Insert-sort the first block into the block sequence based on RH i ; go back to Step 3. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> a variant of this embedded packing scheme is described.</p><p>The block addresses and the ordering information must be coded and stored precisely first in the bitstream. This can be done either by:</p><p>• coding the block addresses in the ordered sequence, or • creating a 'bit-volume' and putting the block's sequence number at the block's reference address in the volume, and then coding the bit-volume.</p><p>We now provide the results of applying our coding scheme to a dataset from a simulation. We tested our methods on a dataset obtained from a simulation of the non-steady flow of fluid between turbine blades. The flow of fluid is axi-symmetric. ColorPlate(a) shows a slice of the density field juxtaposed with the body of the turbine <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The regions of interest are the leading and trailing edges of the blade and the tip of the propeller. The grid is curvilinear and is of size 69x43x15. The solution of the simulation yielded two scalar fields (density, ρ; energy, e) and a vector field (u, v, w). We do not compress the grid in this exercise, rather we restrict ourselves to the scalar fields and components of the velocity field. Thus, the grid file and the compressed solution comprise the data that needs to be transmitted or stored. To determine the correlation mask we create a larger grid of size 128x64x16 through zero-padding. An octree subdivision of the mask provides the required blocks. Starting with the original data in each block, we then perform a wavelet transform. Finally the coefficients and the blocks are all embedded into a bitstream. We now discuss the rate-distortion and rate-information curves for the dataset in question.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">0 i N ≤ ≤ R N i ( ) 1 = R 0 ( ) 0 = RH i m ( ) H i 1 NCSF i j k , , ( ) m Embedded ∈ ∑ -     =</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rate-Distortion Curve:</head><p>The rate-distortion curve is plotted for the components of the dataset <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 5a</ref>). We define the rate to be the percent of the coefficients retained. Thus a rate of one <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> would imply that all coefficients are retained, while a rate of zero implies that none are retained. We plot the distortion for all the fields. The distortion at a given rate is measured by finding the difference between the actual and the partially reconstructed dataset in the mean-square-error (MSE) sense. It is evident that the degradation is non-uniform over the various fields. The v and the w-component of the velocity yield similar behavior; they require that 80% of the signal be retained to obtain a very desirable error of 60dB. Given the axi-symmetric flow there exists more disturbances in directions other than the flow direction. In reality, this is a very encouraging statistic. The other fields fare even better and the same distortion is obtained at the even lower rate of 20%. Essentially, the datasets are very sparse and are amenable to extreme compression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Information-Rate Curve:</head><p>We also plot the information that is embedded in the bitstream at different rates <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 5b)</ref>. The information embedded is given by the quantity E, defined as: <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> Both the quantities H i , RH i are defined in Section 4. The denominator in the ratio measures the information content and is computed as the sum of the mask values over all the blocks. In essence it measures the information in terms of significant structures. The numerator on the other hand, measures the information retained.</p><p>Although the rate-distortion curve is different for at least two of the components the information-rate curve is similar for all of them. This is the case since we measure information in terms of structures as captured by the mask. The masks of all five components are very similar signifying that the regions of discontinuities are similar. The behavior of the information-rate curve is borne out by the visual examination of the components. It is noteworthy that the octree spatial subdivision of the correlation masks for all the components yielded almost the same number of blocks. This leads one to conclude that the discontinuities occur in the same areas of the grid for all components. Since, the quantity E is a gross measure of perceptually significant structures in a dataset, the quantity evaluates to the same value for all components. However, the number of significant blocks is much less in the case of v, w components indicating that significant structures in these datasets are much sharper or discontinuous. Thus, the rate-distortion curve is less steep and requires more coefficients to reconstruct.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Progressive Iso-surface Rendering:</head><p>To show the efficiency of our approach we display the iso-surfaces for a derived quantity, namely pressure. We use FAST <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, a tool often used by CFS engineers to visualize their grids (Note: The checker-board pattern in the background of in ColorPlate(b)-(f) is due to a well-known artifact of the screen door transparency rendering process used in FAST). For incompressible flow, pressure at any point can be computed as follows: <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> where γ is a gas constant. ColorPlate(b) shows the iso-surface of value 0.80 (the range of pressure is [0.44,1.02]) for a rate of 100% (full-resolution). The two significant surfaces exist near the tip of It is important to note that in ColorPlate(c) even at a rate of 20% the iso-surface along the blade is captured at very high fidelity. This is a testimony to the fact that our packing scheme was effective in embedding significant structures very early in the bitstream. Another important observation is that the behavior of our scheme was not affected even though we applied our methods on a non-linear derived quantity, namely pressure.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E 1 RH i i ∑ H i i ∑ ------------------ - = p γ 1 - ( ) e 1 2 ---ρ u 2 v 2 w 2 + + ( ) - = LH 1 HL1 HH 2 HL 2 LL 2 LH 2</formula><p>To further show the effectiveness of our methods, we render isosurfaces at a lower pressure of 0.75. ColorPlate(d) shows the iso-surfaces at the full normalized rate. We see a profusion of surfaces of varying smoothness and curvature. Once again we show the iso-surfaces at rates of 20% (ColorPlate(e)) and 50% (Color-Plate(f)). It is again worthwhile noting that the highly curved surface in the middle is captured with high fidelity even at 20%. The smoother surface at the extreme right is captured accurately at the rate of 30% (not shown). The surface at extreme left is depicted with significantly high fidelity. This once again demonstrates the ranking induced among structures through our methods. The results contained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> do not show the same amount of structuresensitivity; instead the degradation at rates less than full is more uniform. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> CFS datasets are compressed using a non-adaptive blocking scheme.</p><p>The time expended in various stages of the algorithm is not significant. For the given dataset the time expended is less than 10 seconds. Compressing floating point numbers to achieve high compression rates is not a trivial task. Usually an entropy scheme like Huffman coding or even vector quantization can be employed to compress the wavelet coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. It suffices to say that any further compression and quantization schemes in the wavelet domain will only enhance the efficiency of the reported scheme. The decoding cost is also small given the regular pattern of embedding the coefficients and the fact that biorthogonal wavelets were chosen to actually encode the blocks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We presented a multiresolution representation of a volume that is amenable to high compression ratios and progressive trans-mission. The results obtained bear testimony to the use of the method. The method is computationally cheap and can include aspects of the Human Visual System easily. Improvements can come in the form of:</p><p>• better wavelet transforms especially redundant ones • better methods to determine the correlation mask • better packing schemes • adaptive choice of the wavelet function from a library New work can include:</p><p>• further quantization of the coefficients • detecting coherency between successive frames in a time varying simulation</p><p>• datasets from other domains (medical) and modalities The embedded methods developed herein can be used in many other applications besides progressive transmission. For instance, the embedded method would be very useful in storage and database access of datasets. The first magnitude-significant coefficients resulting from a wavelet transform could be used to search for images in a database. It is conceivable that more effective and robust search performance is obtained when the coefficients are ordered by the structures to which they contribute. Also, by including a computational model of the HVS the search can result in perceptually closer matches.</p></div>
