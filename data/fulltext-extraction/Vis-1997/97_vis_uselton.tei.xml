<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Sophisticated visualization tools are commonly used for the analysis of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data and similar computational results. Such tools are much less commonly used for aeronautical data collected in experiments. As data acquisition becomes a digital process, new opportunities arise for analyzing experimental data and for comparing simulation results with experimental measurements, improving the scientific understanding of both. The digitization of data acquisition is as pervasive in the wind tunnels at NASA Ames as it is in most scientific and engineering environments.</p><p>Digital data acquisition methods have also stimulated the creativity of researchers who develop new methods of taking measurements during experiments. But traditional wind tunnel data analysis methods are not always appropriate for such data. One example is a Pressure Sensitive Paint (PSP) System, which makes the construction of the wind tunnel model cheaper and faster, while collecting pressure data on a surface more densely than ever before. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> These developments have led to a collaboration between the visualization group of the NAS Division and the DARWIN <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> team of experimental aerosciences researchers. exVis is the first software to result from this collaboration. While the tool is useful, the value of project has been as much in the learning that occurred in both groups as it is in the utility of the tool itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Design Decisions and Development Process</head><p>It was clear from the beginning that we would be learning about wind tunnel data, wind tunnel experiments and wind tunnel analysis methods as our project progressed. Our counterparts would be learning what is available, what is easy to make and what is hard to do in visually oriented data analysis tools. Most important, we hoped they would be learning a lot about which methods were most useful for their data exploration. To apply what we learned as quickly as possible, rapid prototyping seemed the only reasonable paradigm. The group had already made a commitment to writing more reusable code, and using object oriented software design methods to achieve this goal. PSP is painted across a surface of a wind tunnel model, then pressure data is collected across the area with a video camera. The data resolution is determined by the imaging system used. The previous standard method for measuring pressure on a surface during a wind tunnel test was by use of pressure taps, which actually measure the change in pressure at the openings of small holes drilled in the aeronautical surface. The data from each transducer was recorded on a strip chart, resulting in a graph of pressure versus time at a single location. The usual procedure is to equip a wind tunnel model with several rows of pressure taps, resulting in a data collection array of, for example, four rows of ten pressure taps. The data for each tap is averaged over the time the model is in a specific state, and scaled to yield a dimensionless value called the Coefficient of Pressure, usually written Cp. The average Cp value for each tap in a row is plotted versus the tap's position along the row. These points are connected by line segments, essentially interpolating the pressure. The set of plots, one for each row, effectively summarizes the individual pressure tap information. Sets of plots of this kind are generated for each different air velocity, angle of inclination of the wing, position of flaps or whatever parameters are varied during the testing. Digital data acquisition has automated the process of generating these plots, but the analysts still manually examine books of these plots.</p><p>The PSP system not only collects data much more densely, but avoids the need to drill holes in the model and install transducers. Both time and money are saved, but only if the data acquired is at least as useful as the data previously measured with pressure taps. The PSP system actually measures light intensity on the surface, and by comparing with a reference image and correcting for any illumination variations, converts the observations into an array of Cp values. It is currently common to use both pressure taps and the PSP system for cross-validation.</p><p>After being shown a demonstration of a program developed at an aircraft company, and discussing its strengths and weaknesses with the aeroscientists who use it, we designed and implemented a minimal useful tool for analyzing PSP data, exVis 1. This program served to stimulate discussions of the data analysis process and potentially useful features. exVis, like the program we saw demonstrated, is centered around the use of two windows. The Im-ageViewer displays PSP data as if it were an ordinary image rather than an array of Cp values. The GraphViewer is a simple x-y plotting window, with a few extra features.</p><p>The initial implementation of the ImageViewer is based on a simple Inventor viewer <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and uses predefined color maps specifically requested by aeroscientists. The cursor can be used to query the Cp value at any pixel in the ImageViewer. However, the main analysis method is to select a one dimensional subset of the PSP data for display in a more traditional manner. To select data to graph, the user interactively positions a line segment, called a SliceTool, in the Im-ageViewer and makes a menu selection to graph the data.</p><p>The plot is drawn in the GraphViewer window, with all the usual automatic range scaling and axis marking features. By placing a SliceTool as if it were a row of pressure taps, the user can create the graphs traditionally used for analysis. Once a plot is displayed, points along it can be queried for numerical values or, more interestingly, to show the location in the ImageViewer of the data point corresponding to the selection made in the GraphViewer. The Slice-Tool can be repositioned and additional data can be plotted on the same axes, or a new ImageViewer can be chosen. New SliceTools can also be created, so the locations of previously selected data can remain marked by the previous SliceTools. When a point on a plot in the GraphViewer is selected, the entire line is highlighted, improving clarity of the display, particularly when several plots are on the same axes. The SliceTool position corresponding to the selected line is also indicated, even if the SliceTool has been moved away from that position.</p><p>A third basic module, the Application User Interface (AUI), was added to coordinate the user interaction activities and to coordinate communication between the ImageViewer and GraphViewer, allowing for cleaner implementations and a better chance of reusability for the two basic modules. Through the AUI a user selects the data files to be analyzed, saves the current state of the system or restores from a previously saved state. Many ImageViewers and GraphViewers can be created, with mouse selection to indicate which of each is the target of current operations. By use of multiple ImageViewers and GraphViewers it is as easy to compare similar slices of data from different data sets as it is to compare slices of data from different locations on the same wing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">User Feedback and Results</head><p>The initial prototype software, exVis 1.0, was delivered to the DAR-WIN team in the summer of 1996 and integrated with other DAR-WIN software for a wind tunnel test held in September 1996. This version was added to the list of software that can be ordered from the NAS Division in the fall of 1996, although it was not widely publicized until March of 1997. The DARWIN team incorporated much of the functionality in their web based interface to a database of stored wind tunnel experiment results. Feedback from users and potential users was very positive; they like using it, want to keep using it, and have made suggestions to improve it.</p><p>Some of the suggestions were things we expected, like the need to operate on additional types of data and the need for interactive color map modification. Other comments were unexpected,but easily satisfied. The most obvious example of this kind of change is that Cp values are traditionally plotted on an inverted y axis, the most negative values highest and most positive values lowest. The value of interaction seems to be the biggest surprise for the users. The traditional plots gave them a good idea of the behavior of the system they were measuring; interactive tools invite them to go further, looking for indications of how and why particular behaviors occur in particular circumstances. Another small but important change is the ability to specify multiple vertices for a single SliceTool. This feature was added with multi-component wings in mind, where the desired position or direction might change from one component to the next, but the desired plot considered the data as a single length. Once implemented, it has also been used to select data along curved paths.</p><p>The ability to compare plots was a key to the enthusiastic reception and several users requested more and better tools for comparing images and plots of data taken from them. We gave the name Synchronized Slices to a technique in which several ImageViewers were linked so that SliceTool interactions in one were duplicated in the others. When a plot was requested, data from each ImageViewer was graphed in a single ImageViewer, color coded by source. This strategy worked well for up to three or four Im-ageViewers, but for greater numbers there were problems. The color correspondence became difficult to use, especially since the graphs tend to cross, resulting in colors not in the original set. And the window borders used too much screen space while distracting from effective side-by-side comparisons of the images. Two techniques have evolved from the original Synchronized Slices idea, which are implemented in a variant of the ImageViewer called MultiViewer. The first MultiViewer technique is simply the display of an array of images within a single ImageViewer window. The user can se-lect the dimensions of the array, and the SliceTool operates in Synchronized Slice style. The second viewing technique is to view the images sequentially, and is called FlipBook. Controls allow single step or a complete sweep in either increasing or decreasing order, or continuous cycling through the images. The SliceTool is again synchronized among all the images. The plot associated with data from a particular image is highlighted when that image is displayed by the FlipBook. The data from a single image is also highlighted in the first MultiViewer mode by explicitly selecting the image. The density of the PSP data (and its apparently noisy nature in some examples) makes it difficult to see a single plot among many on the same axes. Highlighting one plot not only makes the traditional information available, but seeing one plot highlighted against the "envelope" of the entire set of plots gives additional context to the traditional information. The new version of our software, called exVis 1.5, incorporates all these features and also reads Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Phased Acoustic Array (PAA) data. Additional modifications were implemented to make selecting larger collections of data easier.</p><p>The accompanying figure shows a MultiViewer, labeled Im-ageViewer 0, and two GraphViewers. An array of nine PSP data images are shown in the MultiViewer. The PSP data shown are from the same OAW-3 Oblique All-Wing model but taken with the wing at different angles of attack. GraphViewer 0 shows the plots of data selected by the SliceTools positioned along the lengths of the wings. Selecting a PSP image in the ImageViewer, as indicated by the white border, causes the corresponding plots to be highlighted in the GraphViewers. GraphViewer 0 shows this plot in blue. GraphViewer 1 shows plots of data selected by the SliceTools crossing the narrow direction of the wing. A point on a plot has been selected in GraphViewer 1. The point is shown in red and the plot is highlighted in cyan. This selection deactivates the previous highlight due to the image selection, and highlights the corresponding SliceTool and point on it, in the lower left image in the MultiViewer.</p><p>The rapid prototyping strategy and the close relationship with aeroscientists interested in our product has made the project both productive and fun. The use of Inventor helped us start quickly, but has become a performance obstacle. Object oriented design and implementation has improved the quality of our software. It also has allowed parts of our code to be collected for reuse and for our project to use code developed for other purposes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">The Future</head><p>A project at NASA Ames called the Advanced Design and Test Environment (ADTE) needs a system which supports analysis and display of multiple data sets from multiple heterogeneous sources (including both experimental and computational) in a unified three dimensional context. The goals of the project include using PSP and three other new data acquisition systems in wind tunnel tests. PIV, (sometimes called Doppler Global Velocimetry -DGV) measures velocity values off the body of the wind tunnel model. The PAA uses known sensor geometry and phase shifts in sound wave arrivals to map the sources of noise around an aeronautical model. The Model Position and Deformation (MPD) System measures the change in the geometry of the wind tunnel model under different test conditions. In addition to these new data types, pressure tap data, CFD data and the geometry of the model are also needed for display. Such a system will serve as an excellent base for our research in coordinated multi-source visualization and comparative visualization. While we will use lessons learned from developing exVis, (and some of the reusable components) we are starting fresh to design and develop new software for three dimensional multi-source visualization that will serve as a testbed for comparative visualization research.</p></div>		</body>
