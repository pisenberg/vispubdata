<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The increasing availability of spatiotemporal data collected from various sources provides new opportunities for understanding the data in their spatial and temporal context. Finding abnormal patterns occurred at some locations and time is of particular interest in many applications such as aerology, public health surveillance, and urban computing. For example, urban scientists and analysts are interested in detecting sudden changes in traffic patterns in a city to help prevent future accidents <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>, likely through better traffic controls and route planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>.</p><p>Traditionally, the problem of anomaly detection has been approached mainly through statistical and machine learning techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. However, the effectiveness of these techniques are often hinged by two major inherent challenges in anomaly detection problem: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> there is often a lack of clear boundary between normal and abnormal cases, and (2) labeled data for training and verifying models are usually unavailable or difficult to collect. These challenges are further aggravated by the proliferation of big data where massive and continuous data flow in from various sources, likely in a streaming format, such as data constantly pulled from weather and traffic sensors, mobile devices and social media sites. On one hand, the various data inputs provide rich, spatiotemporal context information to inform the anomalous occurrences; on the other, the data exhibit very high veracity and volatility in so-called normal cases. The characteristics of big data stress the need for flexibly and adaptively identifying and interpreting normal and abnormal cases along with their rich context information. While visual analytics opens a new possibility to fulfill the need, existing solutions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>) so far are not equipped to handle the large, complex and dynamic data environment. Anomaly detection is one of the important information processing tasks where visual analytics can be advantageous. However, most existing solutions have overlooked two types of information that are external to the machine analytics and visual mapping processes: (a) the dynamic inputs that drive the changes in anomaly definition, and (b) the addi-tional human knowledge that is either undefined or unavailable to the machine-centric approach, referred to as the "soft" knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. We identify three technical challenges in anomaly detection with streaming, spatiotemporal data: (1) Adaptivity toward dynamic, rich context data: the spatiotemporal data are big, dynamic, heterogeneous, and multidimensional; capturing anomalous patterns in such data and at the same time adapting to the data changes and human knowledge accumulated in the system is beyond the capacity of the machine-centric, anomaly detection approach. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> Interpretability: representing such data as well as anomalous patterns intuitively and comprehensively, along with their spatiotemporal context, is difficult with the off-the-shelf visualization solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> or with the modern spatiotemporal visualization platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>. <ref type="formula">3</ref>Interactivity: while there exist systems that tailor for monitoring spatiotemporal anomalies, the needs of supporting online anomaly investigation and incorporating human judgment to guide a system to produce better results has not been addressed.</p><p>In this paper, we introduce Voila (visual analysis of spatiotemporal data), a visual analytics system and framework for interactively detecting anomalies in spatiotemporal data collected from a streaming data source. Our work has the following key contributions:</p><p>• System: We formulate the system design requirements and propose an integrated, visual analytics system that simultaneously tackles adaptivity, interpretability, and interactivity challenges. The system comprises an online data processing pipeline that unceasingly connects streaming data input to the adaptive analysis, visualization, and interaction. • Algorithm: We propose a novel tensor-based anomaly analysis algorithm that not only adapts to the dynamics in the input data but also produces descriptive patterns that can be visually presented along with their spatiotemporal context. • Visualization and Interaction: We propose a set of novel visualization and interaction designs that support users' interpretability and interactivity -in particular, the information foraging and the sensemaking of normal and abnormal patterns. Moreover, we propose a unique interaction framework that enables the system to incorporate users' judgment with machine analytics to aid their information foraging based on a Bayesian approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>In this section, we review techniques that are most relevant to our work, including the anomaly detection algorithms, visual anomaly detection, and visualizations for the spatiotemporal data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Anomaly Detection Algorithms</head><p>Anomaly detection, given its wide range of applications, has been extensively studied over the past decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Various techniques, including statistic-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>, classification-based algorithms (either supervised <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref> or semi-supervised <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>), distance-based algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>, and spectral-based algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>, have been proposed to tackle the problem in different situations. All the techniques discussed here are not exhaustive, rather representative of the different approaches (more comprehensive reviews can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>). These techniques are useful in producing numeric results of anomalies, e.g., the outlierness scores, but are limited in offering interpretation of the anomalies -that is, what features and context exhibited in an abnormal case. Furthermore, most of these techniques lack the capacity to deal with the multi-way or multifaceted features, such as features over time and space. The tensor-based methods have been recently proposed to deal with the multifaceted features <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. These methods leverage tensor decomposition to produce compact feature descriptors along multiple facets, with the advantage to examine features associated with the original, rich context (such as time or space). Most of the tensor-based methods are supervised <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> or semi-supervised <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>, which rely on training models based on labeled cases. Almost all these techniques assume relatively stable patterns in normal cases where the labeled data are easy to collect, and the decomposition can be done in a batch process. This assumption makes it difficult to adapt to the online or streaming situation where the normal patterns may change over time. Most importantly, the interpretability of the tensor decomposition results has not been examined. Recently, Fanaee-T and Gama <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> introduced an unsupervised approach to detect events from a traffic tensor; however, like other methods, the produced feature matrices and their interpretation in the spatiotemporal context have been overlooked.</p><p>There have been techniques specifically designed for detecting anomalies in spatiotemporal data for various purposes, e.g., monitoring the sensor networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, detecting anomalies in the spatial-temporal network data <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>, and finding the change of climate or environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. These algorithms are designed specifically for their applications based on the domain-specific assumptions and knowledge. More general algorithms without domain-specific assumptions have also been recently introduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. However, a crucial limitation of all these approaches is that there has not been a systematic and unified way that helps interpret the results derived from these techniques. In this work, we present a unified framework that allows for detecting and comprehending normal and abnormal cases situated in the streaming, spatiotemporal data scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Visual Anomaly Detection</head><p>As discussed earlier, the ability to interpret normal and abnormal cases are crucial because of the two major inherent challenges in anomaly detection problem: (1) the lack of clear boundary between normal and abnormal cases, and (2) the difficulty of obtaining labeled data for training and verifying models. As a result, human experts' domain knowledge and experience need to be involved in judging the cases. An intuitive, comprehensible visual representation of the data or analysis results is thus extremely useful for supporting interpretation and facilitating a better decision making. Novel visual design <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and visual analysis systems for anomaly detection have been proposed recently, such as systems for detecting spreading of rumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> and anomalous user behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Mckenna et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> studied a cybersecurity dashboard visualization that helps network analysts identify anomalous patterns. There have been visual analysis systems developed for detecting anomalies in spatiotemporal data <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>, e.g., by employing conventional supervised algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. All these systems, however, are restricted in the way human judgment can be used to guide the systems to produce comprehensible results more efficiently during the analysis process.</p><p>Different from all the aforementioned systems, we introduce a visual interactive framework with a novel tensor-based unsupervised algorithm. Our approach not only achieves an anomaly detection performance better than many existing algorithms but also produces comprehensible visual representations that allow human analysts to examine the cases within the rich spatiotemporal context. Moreover, we provide a unique, adaptive anomaly investigation mechanism, which incorporates human judgment to instantly guide the detection algorithm to produce a refined set of anomalies. The proposed framework allows for analyzing and monitoring spatiotemporal data in general big data scenarios -where data are gathered from multiple input streams and near-real-time analysis and visualization are desirable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Visualizing the Spatiotemporal Data</head><p>Spatiotemporal visualization is an interdisciplinary topic that involves techniques from geographic information system (GIS), information visualization, and urban simulation and computing. Langran and Chrisman <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> introduced four primary ways to represent spatiotemporal data in GIS (space-time cubes, sequential snapshots, base-state with amendments, and space-time composites). Andrienko et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> summarized characteristics of spatiotemporal data and further categorized the analysis tasks into the elementary tasks (e.g., given a moment, identifying spatial locations and objects) and the general tasks (e.g., comparing behaviors at the same or different time interval). These tasks have been used to guide the designs for many existing visual analysis systems, including the space-time cube based visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>, visualizations for spatiotemporal analysis and modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and the systems designed for exploring and visualizing large trip data <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, traffic data <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, mobile phone data <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and the telco-data <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>. Some of these systems are designed to reveal vehicle or human mobility patterns for urban planning purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, including public transportation optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> and optimal location selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>Inspired by these early design guidelines and visualization designs, in this work, we propose a novel visual interactive framework, Voila, that is particularly suitable for tackling the analysis challenges in detecting and interpreting anomalies in big, spatiotemporal data. In our framework, the data are transformed into a sequence of tensor time series following both the space-time cube model and the sequential snapshot models. The proposed analysis algorithm then compares the current state of the data with the historical states (general tasks) to detect anomalies, and the visualization represents a snapshot of the data and enables a detailed exploration of anomalies given a particular time and user judgment (elementary task). We further consider the sensemaking models for intelligence analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref> to guide the design of our visual analytics components. The proposed Voila system was designed to meet several real-world requirements for detecting anomalous patterns in the streaming spatiotemporal data. The design objective is to address the three technical challenges discussed earlier, whereas the concrete requirements are formulated through close collaboration with a domain expert whose expertise was in anomaly detection and spatiotemporal data analysis. Over the course of approximately nine months, regular meetings were held in which detailed system design requirements were discussed, and prototype systems were demonstrated to the expert for the purposes of gathering feedback. Three prototypes were built and improvements were made iteratively throughout the process. Below we describe the most critical design requirements (R1-R3) that were developed during these discussions, which motivate the design adopted in our work. R1 Adaptivity: Online monitoring and analysis. The system should be efficient enough to perform a real-time or near real-time monitoring and analysis, given streaming data inputs, so that in the real-world applications the suspicious or abnormal cases detected from the data could be examined in a timely manner. R2 Interpretability: Multifaceted pattern discovery and anomaly filtering. The system should create easy-to-understand designs to assist users in discovering abnormal patterns and help them understand "when and where, what might happen," with rich, spatiotemporal context. It should also direct users' attention to more significant anomaly instances. R3 Interactivity: Human in the analysis loop. Users should be able to provide their judgment during the analysis and guide the system to produce the refined analysis results in real-time. Based on these system requirements, we developed Voila, an integrated system solution for visual analytics addressing anomaly detection in spacial-temporal data. The system employs intuitive visualization designs as well as the anomaly detection techniques designed for multi-way structures to help identify suspicious data patterns in spatiotemporal data. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> illustrates the system architecture and the interactive analysis pipeline that it supports. The system transforms spatiotemporal data into tensor time series and derives and represents the abnormal patterns via four major modules: (1) the data preprocessing module, (2) the analysis module, (3) the visualization module, and (4) the interaction module. In particular, the data preprocessing module transforms the raw data into a series of multi-way tensors with each tensor representing multifaceted data in a given time epoch in which the anomalous patterns will be investigated. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>, new tensors capturing data in the later time epochs can be incrementally added into the series of tensors for analysis. This streaming pipeline facilitates the online monitoring and analysis (R1). In our implementation, the data preprocessing module runs in parallel on a spark cluster and the processed results are stored using the MongoDB 1 database for later retrieval of the results. The analysis module includes a novel, tensor-based anomaly detection algorithm that derives interpretable, anomalous patterns from streaming inputs (R1,2). The visualization module comprises a set of rich-context views that show the spatiotemporal patterns and reveal suspicious instances derived from the tensor analysis (R2). The interaction module provides an on-line, user feedback mechanism based on a Bayesian updating rule. With this module, users can guide the system to re-order the important anomalous patterns in real-time by incorporating users' judgment and observations without the re-computation of the tensor analysis, which makes the system salable and responsive to the user interactions (R3). As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>, the system monitors the spatiotemporal data collected from a streaming data source in a near-real-time. We describe a system that runs in real-time if it is fast enough to calculate the data while collecting them, i.e., the computation delay can be ignored. We note that our system runs in near-real-time as the data analysis and the visualization of analysis results are lagging slightly behind the data collection process. In particular, within each time span in the time series, the system collects and transforms the data into a tensor, thus producing a tensor time series. When sufficient initial data are accumulated, the system continues analyzing and visualizing the data collected at past time epoch (t − 1), while keeping the new data arriving at the current time epoch (t). The historical data, whenever available, can be analyzed offline through an unsupervised learning procedure to enhance and calibrate the online analysis. The granularity of the time epoch can be chosen to be an hour, a day, a week, or a month, depending on the data input and the computational capacity of the data preprocessing and analysis modules. Details about the tensor-based data model and analysis methods will be discussed in the next section.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">ANOMALOUS PATTERN EXTRACTION</head><p>In this section, we introduce a novel tensor-based anomalous pattern discovery algorithm. Given a streaming input of spatiotemporal data, the objective of this algorithm is to identify any suspicious regions that potentially contain anomalies in an investigation space over time. After transforming the streaming spatiotemporal data into a time series of tensors, the algorithm produces a set of expected patterns based on the common distributions captured in the historical data, and identifies the regions in which the newly observed, empirical patterns are significantly deviated from what would be expected as anomalies. The analysis procedure comprises four key steps as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>(1-4), which are detailed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data Model and Transformation</head><p>The first step ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>(1)) is to transform the spatiotemporal data from a streaming data source ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4(a)</ref>) into a tensor time series as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(b).</head><p>A tensor, denoted as X , is a mathematical representation of a multi-dimensional array, i.e., an extension of concepts such as scalars (denoted as x), vectors (denoted as x), and matrices (denoted as X) to higher dimensions. A tensor is called n-way tensor if it has ndimensions or modes. The dimensionality of each mode is determined by the number of its containing elements. For example, the three-way tensor X ∈ R I 1 ×I 2 ×I 3 + has three modes with the dimensionality of I 1 , I 2 , and I 3 , respectively. R + indicates that all the elements of X contain non-negative values, which commonly applies to situations when data represents numbers of observed instances.</p><p>The data that capture the spatiotemporal changes in various features can be modeled using the tensor representation -to reflect the "spacefeature-time" associations. Given a set of K dimensional features, the data can be represented as a three-way tensor, denoted as X ∈ R N×K×M</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>+</head><p>, where N indicates the number of regions in the space and M indicates the number of time steps in an epoch to be investigated. Here, the regions could be chosen as the administrative divisions in a city, or a set of grid cells that uniformly partition the geographical scope of a city. Each element of the tensor, X ik j , indicates the value of the k-th feature in the region i at time j.</p><p>Note that there are two notions of temporal resolution: the resolution of data collection, denoted by time epoch, and the resolution of analysis, denoted by time step. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>, the streaming spatiotemporal data are collected on the basis of time epoch. For data within a time epoch, we create a tensor in a finer granularity based on the resolution of time step.</p><p>We illustrate the tensor data representation using a traffic dataset as an example. The data can be collected and processed on a daily basis, results in a tensor X in each day capturing the changes of traffic features ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4(b)</ref>). In this scenario, the spatial granularity of X , i.e., a region, could be a grid cell in a set of equal-size grid cells that uniformly partition the space (i.e., a city) where the data were collected <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 4(a)</ref>). The temporal granularity of X , i.e., a time step, could be an hour within the scope of a day (time epoch). We construct features that capture all traffic flows (number of vehicles) in the city within a day to be represented in a tensor. Specifically, for the i-th region at the j-th time step, we construct a 2N-dimensional feature vector, To better understand the representation, we now describe a realworld taxi trip dataset that will be used in our experiment.</p><p>Dataset. The New York City taxi-trip data 2 collected in 2014 and 2015. We extracted a subset of the taxi-trip data containing over 100 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/tri record data.shtml million taxi trips within the Manhattan area. We partitioned the area into grids of 311 equal-sized regions (each has an area of 2 × 2 km 2 ). The data were first processed offline using parallel Spark clusters and were converted into a time series of tensors to simulate the streaming input, with time epoch set as a day, and the time step as two hours. We extracted 622 features for each region, which capture a region's in-coming and out-going taxi flows. Thus, the series contain over 720 tensors (spanning two years), each with the shape 311 × 622 × 12. We employed this time series as the input of the Voila to simulate the real-time monitoring scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Extracting Expected Patterns</head><p>The second step ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>(2)) is to extract the expected patterns that commonly exist in the space based on the historical data given in the input tensor time series to facilitate capturing the anomalous patterns.</p><p>Given spatiotemporal data stored in a tensor, we derive the expected, latent patterns from the data through tensor decomposition. Tensor decomposition is an analysis that factorizes a tensor into a superdiagonal core tensor multiplied by a matrix along each mode. For example, given P, the number of desired latent patterns, the decomposition of a three-way tensor X ∈ R N×K×M + is to optimize the following objective function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">min X − [[Z ; A, B, C]]<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where A, B, and C are three factor matrices, and • denotes the Frobenius norm of a tensor (as well as a matrix or a vector).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">[[•]</formula><p>] denotes a PARAFAC-like decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, where A, B, and C are respectively in the shapes of N × P, K × P, and M × P, with latent patterns captured through a reduced dimensionality P, and Z ∈ R P×P×P + is the core tensor whose diagonal elements represent the relative strength of the corresponding patterns. In particular, each column in A and C represents the distribution of the latent patterns over different regions and time, respectively. Each row in A and C is a P-dimensional vector, denoted as A[i, :] or C[ j, :], which respectively indicates the likelihoods of the patterns occurred in the region i at time j, referred to as the patterns' occurrence-likelihoods. B is the latent "feature-pattern" matrix which provides each latent pattern by a set of co-occurring features. The analysis is analogous to the topic modeling in which latent topics interpreted by a set of relevant keywords are extracted from a corpus. Given the three-way tensor in form of "region-feature-time", the regions at a particular time are analogous to the documents, and the features are analogous to the keywords in documents. Thus latent patterns derived from the tensor are analogous to the latent topics derived from the document corpus. Here, a pattern is captured by a distribution over a set of relevant features as a latent topic captured by a distribution over a set of relevant keywords. Moreover, our tensor-based analysis taking into account the richer context information in the data, such as the temporal dimension, in a unified manner.</p><p>We propose the following analysis model to detect latent patterns from a tensor time series:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">B * = arg min n ∑ t=1 ( X t − [[Z ; A t , B, C t ]] + α A t − A t−1 + β C t − C t−1 ) (2) subject to: B T B = I, B ≥ 0, A t ≥ 0, C t ≥ 0,t = 1, 2,...,M</formula><p>in which, we fix B during the analysis to capture the innate patterns that remain unchanged over time in the investigation space. The constraint B T B = I ensures all the patterns captured by B (i.e., B's column vectors) are orthogonal to each other, thus making them unique and distinguishable. The factor matrices A t and C t are smoothed according to their preceding matrices (the second and third regularization terms) to reduce data noises. The degree of smoothness is controlled respectively by the parameter α and β . All the factor matrices are constrained to be non-negative, which facilitates the interpretability of occurrence-likelihood.</p><p>We solve the above optimization problem using block coordinate descent <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> in an offline procedure based on a tensor time series of the historical data. The resulting matrix B * captures the expected patterns occurred in the given space (e.g., a city) during the given period of time, which is used as the basis for calculating the regional anomaly scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Extracting Dynamic Patterns</head><p>In the step of context analysis <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 4(3)</ref>), the algorithm investigates the expected patterns' occurrence-likelihoods in space and time based on a testing tensor X t in the series via the following tensor decomposition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">min X t − [[Z ; A t , B * , C t ]]</formula><p>(3) where the expected patterns, i.e., B * are preserved. A t and C t are factor matrices that respectively represent how the patterns are distributed in regions and time in the scope given by X t . In particular, A t indicates the patterns' occurrence-likelihoods in regions, which is latter used for calculating the regional anomaly score. C t captures the time-varying context information as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4(e)</ref>.As the expected patterns, B * , are preserved, A t and C t may vary significantly from the normal case if the real patterns in the analysis scope, X t , are different from the expected ones. In particular, detecting how patterns are varying in regions based on A t will in particular helpful in terms of locating an anomaly at a given time, which will be discussed next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Extracting Anomalous Patterns</head><p>Based on the above analysis of expected and dynamics patterns, we derive measures to quantify the extent to which a region would have anomalous patterns. We calculate an anomaly score s i for each region r i at a given time t by examining the changes of the patterns' occurrencelikelihoods in r i based on A t [i, :] where each element A t [i, k] indicates the likelihood of the k-th latent pattern occurring in r i at time t. Then, by comparing A t [i, :] with its historical values {A t [i, :]} t &lt;t , we can determine how much the pattern of r i at time t deviates from what would be expected from the historical data. The deviation can be computed by leveraging anomaly detection methods such as local outlier factor (LOF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and One-Class SVM <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In our experiment, we find LOF performs better as it is more robust against false positive cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">VISUALIZATION AND INTERACTION</head><p>In this section, we introduce the visualization and interaction components. We begin with the design consideration, followed by the technical details of each component.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Design Tasks</head><p>The design of the visual analytics modules was iteratively refined based on the discussions with our domain expert. In particular, we discussed and formulated the key challenges and system requirements for visually analyzing anomalies in the large streaming spatiotemporal data and further identified a set of key features to be supported and key information to be represented through the visualizations. We then reconsidered these requirements based on the sensemaking model for intelligence analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. One of the most widely used models, proposed by Pirolli and Card <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, describes two iterative loops in the sensemaking process: the information foraging loop and the sensemaking loop. The former involves processes aimed at seeking information, searching and filtering it, and reading and extracting information, while the latter involves iterative development of a mental model (a conceptualization or schematic representation) that best fits the evidence. These processes are not necessarily sequential or discrete, but can be parallel <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Guided by these characteristics, we organize our design consideration into seven design tasks (T1-T7). The first three tasks aim to support information foraging loop -to augment users' information seeking through overview (T1), ranking (T2), and linking to the raw data (T3). The next three tasks aim to support sensemaking loop -to augment users' conceptualization of normal and abnormal cases through showing patterns in context (T4), comparing patterns (T5), and external memorization (T6). The final task (T7) is to incorporate users' additional judgment to enhance both information foraging and sensemaking loops. We summarize the design tasks as follows. T1 Overview of the investigation scope. Due to the complexity (big, dynamic, heterogeneous, and multidimensional) of the spatiotemporal data, it is critical to provide a visualization that clearly illustrates the spatial and temporal scopes in which the anomalies are analyzed to help narrow down the searching space. T2 Dynamic visual ranking of suspicious regions. Visualization should be designed to aid the searching and filtering of anomalous information through visually revealing the suspicious regions in some order such that users' information seeking effort can be directed to more suspicious regions. T3 Efficient browsing of the raw data. The raw information, for example, the taxi trips entering or leaving a region in the New York City, shows evidence of that may be used to confirm or disconfirm an anomaly case. Therefore, the visualization should enable an efficient mechanism to extract and explore the raw data. T4 Interpreting anomaly in their spatiotemporal contexts. A schematic representation of anomaly patterns helps users develop a mental model to organize various types of normal and abnormal cases, which improves the capacity of users to attend to more of the structure of organized evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. The interpretation of these patterns needs to be established through showing the patterns along with their spatial and temporal occurrences (context), including the relevant raw data and features, the statistics derived from the historical data, and the occurrence-likelihood of the expected patterns. T5 Facilitating visual data comparisons and correlations. The visualization and interaction should be designed to enable users to make comparisons over patterns or data instances, or provide visual cues for finding relevant patterns and instances, to help users support, disconfirm, or re-evaluate their findings of anomalies. T6 External memorization of anomaly analysis. Once a suspicious region is attended, or an anomaly is identified, the system should allow users to record their analysis statuses and results into snapshots to facilitate a later review or further examination. T7 Updating analytics based on human judgment. The system should provide an interaction mechanism that allows incorporating human belief or judgment that is missing in machine training <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, such that all the views can be dynamically updated based on the human judgment and consequently redirect users' attention to alternative patterns or instances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">User Interface</head><p>Guided by the above design tasks and the expert user feedback, we develop our visualization and interaction components. The UI of Voila system, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5</ref>, consists of key views corresponding to each of the tasks: (1) the macro map view shows the overview of the anomaly detection results and within the spatial context (T1); (2) the micro map view and (3) the history view respectively show the spatial and temporal context of a focal region and the associated raw information, as well as the temporal statistics from the historical data to help examine the anomaly cases (T3); (4) the temporal pattern view shows the temporal distributions of the expected patterns (derived from the factor matrix C) over the current and preceding epochs (T4,5); (5) the snapshot panel and (6) the anomaly panel respectively allow users to record the suspicious regions and anomaly cases for later retrieval and further examination (T6); (7) the ranking panel orders the suspicious regions according to their anomaly scores updated based on the tensor analysis and user feedback (T2); (8) the feature inspection view allows for comparing how the regions at a given time are similar in terms of sharing similar features (T5). In all these views, regions are shown with colors encoding the anomaly-related information (detailed below) derived both from the tensor analysis and real-time user feedback (T7). Different color schemes are designed to illustrate different information such as the anomaly scores, the statistical information, the data difference, and the z-score values as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5(f)</ref>. To avoid ambiguity, an adaptive color legend is designed ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5(g)</ref>) which illustrates meaning and scale of colors shown in the corresponding views. Usage scenario. To understand how Voila's different views work together, let us consider the following scenario. Take, for example, Mike, a security officer in the NYC Public Safety Department, whose duties are to ensure the safety and security in the city through routinely monitoring the city's traffic system, identifying anomalous traffic incidents, and being alert to potential hazard such as civil disorders. To increase his capacity, he uses the Voila system that takes streaming data from various sources (e.g. taxi trips, traffic sensors, etc.) as input. The system produces a near real-time overview of the traffic anomalies in the macro map view, showing a set of suspicious regions automatically. To see what happened in those regions, Mike first investigates the highly anomalous regions identified by the system; he picks such regions from the macro map view and ranking panel, checks the regions' raw trip information and statistics in the micro map view, and compares the information with historic data by navigating through the history view. When he confirms that certain regions are indeed anomalous, he clicks and marks those regions, and the system automatically captures those regions into the anomaly panel, updating all anomalous information based on Mike's input. Alternatively, if he finds suspicious regions that warrant further examination, he captures them into the snapshot panel. Later, he can retrieve these suspicious regions, compare them with other regions using feature inspection view, or explore different patterns typically seen in the city through temporal pattern view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Macro Map View</head><p>The macro map view presents a geographical map overlaid with equalsize grids that uniformly partition the entire space to be investigated (e.g., a city). It provides an overview of the anomalous information in the form of a heatmap with visual cues to direct users attention to the most "interesting" regions. Two different modes are provided: (1) the anomaly detection mode <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1(a)</ref>) and (2) the context mode <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1(b,c)</ref>). Users can switch between the two modes based on the buttons as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5(b,c)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Anomaly Detection Mode</head><p>The tensor-based anomaly detection algorithm identifies a set of suspicious regions with high anomaly scores (ref. <ref type="bibr">Section 4)</ref>. However, when a user (e.g., Mike) investigates these regions, s/he looks for evidence to support the anomaly identification. Therefore, users need to consider two types of complementary, contextual information when manually investigate certain regions: (1) how likely a region contains anomalies, and (2) how difficult it is to find out the anomaly evidence in the region. To assist users' inspection, the visual analysis system needs to help leverage the two types of information so users can decide where to pay their attention first, and how much efforts they should spend at different areas.</p><p>Context-guided inspection. To guide users' analysis with the aforementioned consideration, we associate each region i with two probabilistic quantities: p i indicates the likelihood of the region i containing an anomaly, and q i indicates the difficulty of finding an anomaly inside the region. Let s i be the anomaly score of this region derived from the tensor analysis (Section 4.4). Then, p i is given by normalizing the anomaly scores over the entire space:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">p i = s i ∑ N j=0 s j<label>(4)</label></formula><p>q i should reflect the region's properties such as the volume of data and the number of road crossings that may result in the difficulties of identifying an anomaly. Take the taxi-trip data as an example, an anomalous event would be hard to detect if the region has many trips that enter from or head to diverse directions. Formally, let v ik be the total number of trips from the region i to region k, and v i is the total number of trips leaving (or entering) the region i. The diversity of the trip directions, d i is estimated based on the information entropy:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">d i = − ∑ k =i v ik v i log 2 v ik v i<label>(5)</label></formula><p>q i is thus calculated by considering both the trip volume and the diversity of trip directions: where q i is normalized to [0, 1] as it represents probability. Anomaly glyph. We design an anomaly glyph to show visual cues for the context-guided inspection. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6</ref>, an anomaly glyph for a region is represented as a rectangle corresponding to the boundary of the region, with the background color representing p, and the size of the inner rectangle representing √ q, which visually enhances the value q that is usually too small to be visualized. For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6(a)</ref> illustrates the case in which the region is highly suspicious (with high p value shown in dark red in its background) but very easy to examine (with low q value shown with small inner rectangle). In comparison, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6(b)</ref> indicates the region is highly suspicious but difficult to examine and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6(c)</ref> indicates the region is not suspicious (light red in background), but if there is an anomaly, it is difficult to be found (large inner rectangle). Users usually only need to focus on those high suspicious ones with large p value.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">q i = v i max 0≤ j≤N v j • d i max 0≤ j≤N d j (6)</formula><p>Updating with user feedback. During the process of interactive anomaly inspection, users are guided to first inspect one of the most suspicious regions (one tha has the highest p value shown in an anomaly glyph with the darkest red color). After inspection, the user labels the region based on their judgments to indicate whether the region indeed contains an anomaly or not. To facilitate the succeeding analysis, once a region is labeled, the anomaly glyphs in the space should be always automatically updated to highlight the region to be investigated in the next. To achieve this goal, we propose a Bayesian approach to update regions' anomaly scores by incorporating human judgment in real time.</p><p>The Bayes' theorem calculates the probability of an event A given the prior knowledge of a certain condition B that is relevant to A, which is formally given as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)<label>(7)</label></formula><p>In our problem, we estimate the probability p j = P(A j |B k ) of the event A j ("the anomaly exists in the region j") occurred in condition of B k (i.e., "the user fails to find the anomaly in the region k") at each inspection step. Specifically, when the user fails to find the anomaly in the region k, the probability of another region j containing an anomaly is calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">p j = P(A j |B k ) =        P(B k |A k )P(A k ) P(B k ) = p k q k 1 − p k (1 − q k ) ( j = k) P(B k |A j )P(A j ) P(B k ) = p j 1 1 − p k (1 − q k ) ( j = k)<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where P(A j ) = p j indicates the probability of an anomaly in region j. P(B k |A j ) is defined to be 1 for k = j to reflect the user's belief that s/he cannot find an anomaly in the region k, regardless. P(B k |A k ) = q k when k = j as it reflects the probability of "failing to find an anomaly in the region i even there exist one due to certain difficulty." P(B k ) indicates the probability that the user fails to find an anomaly in region k, which can be calculated in two conditions: P(B k |A k )P(A k ) (the user fails to find an anomaly in the region k given no anomaly exist in it) and P(B k |A k )P(A k ) (an anomaly exists in the region k, but the user fails to find it due to certain difficulty). Formula 8 updates the anomaly scores of all the regions in the space when a region is inspected and labeled by the user. In particular, after the re-normalization such that ∑ j p j = 1, the probabilities of other regions p j = p k • 1/(1 − p k (1 − q k )) &gt; p j increase (i.e., when j = k), whereas p k &lt; p k decreases as the region k is just inspected and the user fails to find the anomaly in it, which is consistent with users' intuition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">Context mode</head><p>The context mode of the macro map shows the statistical information derived either from the raw data or the tensor analysis. These different statistics are shown with corresponding heatmaps as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1(b)</ref>. For example, when analyzing the NYC taxi-trip data, user can choose to show one of the primary statistic information associated with regions, including the number of incoming, out-going, and internal trips, as well as the differences between the number of incoming and out-going trips <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1(b-1)</ref>) per region. When showing the number of trips, each region is represented as a flow glyph with the direction given by the gradient of the statistics with respect to the region's neighborhood, which captures the potential traffic flow <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1(b-2)</ref>).</p><p>Another important context to be shown in the context mode is the expected patterns captured in the factor matrix B * as described in Section 4.3. When analyzing the NYC taxi-trip data, B * ∈ R 2N×P + captures P expected patterns via the in-coming and out-going trips through a concatenated 2N-dimensional features, where N is the number of regions in the investigation space. In particular, the vectors B * [0 : N, j] and B * [N + 1 : 2N, j] respectively indicate the quantities of the in-coming and out-going trips in each region corresponding to the j-th pattern. This information can be visualized in a heatmap in the context view as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig.1(c)</ref> in which four different patterns are illustrated respectively. In particular, in this heatmap, a region's color is a blending between red and blue that respectively indicates the quantities of in-coming and out-going trips. The portions of blue (denoted as α) and red (denoted as β ) during the blending is determined respectively by the portion of out-going and in-coming trips calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">α = B * [i, j] B * [i, j] + B * [N + i, j] , β = (1 − α)<label>(9)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Micro Map View and History View</head><p>When a user chooses to investigate a particular region, the region's detailed information, such as the raw data and relevant statistics, will be shown in the micro map view <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 5(2)</ref>) and the history view ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 5(3)</ref>). The micro map view depicts the relationship between the focal region and the remaining regions. A heatmap is generated on the map centered on the focal region, with colors reflecting the strength of the relationships. We show three types of relationships: (i) raw in-coming or out-going flows at a given time, directly extracted from the raw data, (ii) expected in-coming or out-going flows derived from the tensor analysis as described before (i.e., based on the B * matrix), and (iii) deviated flow with respect to the focal region's historic data, which reveals how the flows at a given time deviate from their typical or normal values. The history view shows the anomaly scores of the focal region over time as a time-series chart, from which a user can inspect how the focal region's abnormal behavior changes over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Temporal Pattern View</head><p>The temporal pattern view <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 5(4)</ref>) visualizes the temporal distribution of the dynamic latent patterns derived from the tensor analysis, as described in Section 4.3. Specifically, the temporal factor matrix C t of the current epoch t is visualized as a list of small multiple charts, where each row k in the temporal view represents the temporal distribution of the k-th latent pattern captured by the column vector C t <ref type="bibr">[:, k]</ref>, with background color indicating the degree of anomaly for the corresponding time when compared with the history, which is determined by the largest regional anomaly score in the investigation space at the given epoch. While monitoring, the length of the temporal view increases when a new epoch is added into the system for investigation. The small multiple time series produced based on C t of the current epoch are appended at the right end of the timeline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Other Views</head><p>The system also provides other views for various purposes. In particular, Feature Inspection View <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5(5)</ref>) shows the similarity among regions in terms of sharing similar expected patterns. In this view, each region is represented as a circle with the color indicating its anomaly score and size indicating the trip volume at the given time. The spatial distance between two regions on this view reflects their similarity which is calculated based on MDS projection. Ranking Panel <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5(6)</ref>) shows a list of highly suspicious regions ordered based on their anomaly scores. Snapshot Panel <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5(7)</ref>) shows the snapshots of the macro map view manually captured by the users during their inspection. Anomaly Panel <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5(8)</ref>) shows the snapshots of the micro map view automatically captured while the users click to inspect a suspicious region.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7">Interactions</head><p>The following interactions are designed to help with the data exploration and anomaly inspection. Anomaly Inspection: Users can left click on the macro-map view to select a region and show its context details in the micro map view and they can also single/double/ right click the region to label the cell as an abnormal/normal. The anomaly list will automatically captures the context of the anomaly shown in the micro map view into a picture. Snapshot Capturing: User can click the button shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5(d)</ref> to capture a snapshot of the current macro-map view into the snapshot view ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5(5)</ref>). Context Switching: Users can switch between different visualization modes to show different information via buttons shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5(b)</ref> (the anomaly detection mode), and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5</ref>(c) (the context mode). They can also to illustrate the patterns in the context mode of the macro map view by select a row in the temporal view via clicking the pattern labels( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5(h)</ref>). Filtering: In the system, a user can filter the regions shown in the macro and micro map views via a range slider ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5(e)</ref>) respectively based on their (1) anomaly scores, (2) the volumes of the containing data, and (3) z-scores. Dynamic Zooming and Panning: Both the macro-map view and the micro-map view support zooming and panning for exploring a large set of data items. Analyst can scroll the mouse to zoom and drag the mouse to pan. Highlight, Link and Brush: All the views are linked together. For example, when mouse hovers on a region in the map a tooltip showing the region's profile information and the z-map thumbnail centered at the region <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5(i)</ref>) will be displayed and all the corresponding regions in the list view, distribution view, and micro map view will be highlighted. Users can also brush to select a set of regions in the distribution view to highlight them in the macro mapview.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">EVALUATION</head><p>This section reports the evaluation of the proposed approach. We evaluated the algorithm effectiveness based on a quantitative evaluation, and studied the usability and usefulness of the system based on a case study with feedback from a domain expert. Both studies were conducted based on the New York City taxi-trip data described in Section 4.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Quantitative Evaluation</head><p>We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through a quantitative comparison with baseline methods based on human labeled ground truths.</p><p>Ground-truth labeling. We recruited 12 annotators to manually label the anomaly incidents within the Manhattan area over a six-month period (2014/01-2014/06). The annotators were asked to search online news reports exhaustively and any public information documented the event occurrence (e.g., the list of the NYC top events 3 ). Over 300 potential anomaly events were first identified, and the annotators independently verified these events into a golden list of 96 anomaly incidents. Based on the list, the annotators manually label each region at each given time as positive if it corresponded to an anomaly occurrence, and negative otherwise.</p><p>Baseline methods and evaluation metrics. Two of the most widely adopted methods, LOF and One-Class SVM were chosen as the baseline. As described in Section 4.4, our algorithm augments both methods with tensor analysis. For brevity, we only report our best-performed method (tensor analysis with LOF). We compared our algorithm, denoted as "TA" (tensor-based anomaly detection) with the two baseline methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> http://www.bizbash.com/new-yorks-top-100-events-2014/newyork/story/27977/ in terms of standard information retrieval metrics: precision, recall, and ROC. As the ratio between positive and negative instances is extremely imbalanced, we use the precision-recall curves and ROC curves to discuss the results. Evaluation results. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7</ref>, overall, our algorithm (TA) outperforms the baseline methods. The ROC plot <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 7(a)</ref>) shows that, compared with LOF and One-Class SVM, TA had higher true positive rates when the false positive rates remain low (below 0.2). However, TA can achieve even higher positive rates while the baseline methods suffer from finding more true anomalies. (The One-Class SVM, for example, produced very low false positive rates but also could not reach high true positive rates.) The precision-recall plot <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 7(b)</ref>) consistently reveals that TA can always achieve higher precision at the low recall conditions, but has the additional flexibility to achieve higher recall when slightly lower precision (e.g., 0.6-0.8) could be tolerated. This characteristic is crucial as it enables our system to retrieve a richer set of highly suspicious events that are otherwise difficult to find through the alternative algorithms. With the aid of system's visual analytics, users can then further investigate the set of suspicious events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Case Study &amp; Domain Expert Interview</head><p>We qualitatively studied the usability and usefulness of the Voila system through a semi-structured interview with a domain expert. The study serves two purposes: (a) to provide real examples to showcase the capability of the system, and (b) to provide user feedback on the system. Below, we describe the study set-up, the representative cases, and summarize the expert feedback on the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1">Study set-up and interview process</head><p>We invited an expert who has highly relevant expertise in public safety and traffic monitoring but has no prior knowledge about the incidences in our dataset. The expert is both an officer and a data scientist from the Institute of Public Safety in Shanghai (a city that has a scale comparable with the NYC). The interview lasted approximately 1.5 hours, which included two sessions: (1) introduction (30 minutes): an introduction to the dataset and the key features of the Voila system, followed by a tutorial and a user-practice sessions, and (2) discovery (60 minutes): a session where the expert was asked to use the system to identify anomalies, explore patterns, interpret and discuss her findings, and comment on the system capabilities. During the interview, a moderator was available to answer questions and record comments from the expert. The moderator also prompted questions for discussion, e.g., "How would you (or where did you) find that instance/pattern?" "How do you know this is an anomaly?" "What does it mean?" "How would this fit into your work?" "What worked well (or poorly) for you?" In the discovery session, the expert quickly identified several anomaly incidents and characteristic patterns. We briefly describe two representative cases in the following.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2">Representative cases</head><p>Exploring the expected patterns. The first feature that caught the expert's attention is the presentation of the city's expected patterns as well as the ability to browse these patterns. The expert explored the expected patterns by clicking each row of the temporal pattern view, and inspected the patterns on the macro map view using the context mode. The expert quickly found several interesting patterns (as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1(c)</ref>) where he can easily make sense. For example, a pattern (weekend parties; <ref type="figure">Fig. 1(c1)</ref>) captures the traffic flows within the downtown Manhattan (where the major arts/entertainment regions such as Broadway located) and between downtown and uptown (residential areas) that regularly occurred during the midnights in weekends. Other patterns capture the everyday routines in the city, such as the rush hour traffics in the mornings and evenings <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1(c2,c3)</ref>, and the frequent travels in midtown in the afternoons <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 1(c4)</ref>). Detecting anomalies in Manhattan. After browsing through the expected patterns, the expert started engaging in finding and discussing the suspicious events. For example, when looking at the trips from 2014/03/12, a suspicious region in the uptown Manhattan, detected and highlighted by the system as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8(a)</ref>, caught the expert's attention. He clicked the region, trying to get the detailed spatial and temporal contexts from the the micro map view <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 8(b)</ref>) and the history view <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 8(c)</ref>). From the z-score based heatmap, he found anomalous taxi traffic flows between the focal region and two other regions -in particular, the z-scores are significantly higher compared with their historical values. He found one of them has the nearest fire station, and the New York City Fire Department is located in another region. Based on these, he conjectured a fire incident occurred in the focal region, which we verified as a gas explosion incident <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. Context-guided inspection reveals new anomalous region when receiving user feedback.</p><p>When investigating the potential anomalies, the expert also got very interested in Voila's context-guided inspection. For example, a suspicious region located in the Randalls and Wards Island was initially highlighted by the system <ref type="figure">(Fig. 9(a)</ref>). Based on the region's contextual information and the historical anomaly scores shown in the history view, the expert quickly found it was a park that frequently exhibited anomalous behaviors due to the frequent fluctuated traffic around the neighborhood, which we verified as a regular fishing contest <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . He decided to mark the region as normal -based on this human judgment, the system instantly updated the anomaly scores of other regions. Then, another region was highlighted and immediately caught the expert's attention ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 9(b)</ref>), which was verified as an irregular event (a public concert that attracted many people) happened on the same day.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.3">User feedback</head><p>During the discovery session, the expert provided a wealth of insightful feedback and comments, which we briefly summarize into four aspects. (1) System: The expert was impressed by the system design and the overall monitoring capability. "It's both cool and useful!" He commented, "especially for monitoring public safety," "we deal with the videos and images generated from the security cameras and video surveillance systems every day but have been struggled with finding important events from the enormous data; this system makes it possible to easily identify warning signs from big data." While he felt the information presented in the system is "very comprehensive," "it was a little overwhelming at first glance." He suggested that tacit tutorial or instructions could be added in the system to guide the first-time users.</p><p>(2) Visualization: According to the expert's feedback, most of the visualization components successfully meet our design goals. For example, the expert felt the temporal pattern view and the heatmap visualization were fairly easy to comprehend and indeed helped discover many interesting patterns. "The anomaly glyph design is easy to understand; showing both anomaly scores and the difficulty of finding anomalies is very useful in real applications, although the updating rules seem to be complicated . . . " He commented, "the history view looks quite simple but very helpful in ruling out false positive cases." Compared with these views, "the MDS view seems less useful," and "the z-map requires a little more time to grasp the meaning." He particularly likes the visualization of expected patterns, "this is very interesting and informative . . . I cannot wait to see the patterns derived from Shanghai city!" (3) Interaction: He felt that showing the ranking of potential anomalies is "a new and smart idea." However, "when dealing with big data, it would be helpful if the system could tell users when to stop looking." Besides, the current system doesn't support "fact checking," and it took time for analysts to verify the detected anomalies, e.g., by searching events using a search engine; thus, he suggested, "it can be made even powerful to support the event search in the future." (4) Usefulness and applicability: The expert was confident that the system could be effectively used in smart city applications. He mentioned the stampede happened on New Year's Eve of 2015 in Shanghai, where at least 36 people died and 49 were seriously injured, "with this system, we could have seen the anomalous traffic flows a few hours before the event happened, and the accident might have been prevented." He further suggested that in the real city traffic monitoring scenarios, there is a need to use fine-grained temporal resolutions for data input (e.g., on a minute-by-minute basis), to incorporate as many data sources as possible (e.g., cellphone or other mobility data), and potentially to forecast or predict future incidents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper, we introduce a visual analysis system, Voila, for interactively detecting anomalies in spatiotemporal data from a streaming source. The system is built based on several real-world requirements, such as online monitoring and interactivity. We propose a novel tensorbased anomaly detection algorithm with visualization and interaction design that dynamically produces contextualized, interpretable data summaries and allows for interactively ranking anomalous patterns based on user input. Using the NYC taxi-trip data, we evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of Voila through a quantitative comparison and an expert interview. Our study results indicate the system's strengths and point out several new directions for future work, including providing tacit tutorials to guide the novice users, offering visual clues about low-precision instances in the anomaly ranking list, supporting fact search and checking, adaptively determining the temporal granularity, and developing new algorithms with forecasting and prediction capability.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>The system architecture.</figDesc></figure>

The next N dimensions capture the incoming flow entering the i-th region from every other region, i.e., X [i, N + k, j] indicates the flow from the (N + k)-th region to the i-th region at time j. X [i, i, j] and X [i, N + i, j] are two special cases: both indicate the internal flows within the i-th grid (one of which is omitted in the analysis to avoid redundancy).</figDesc></figure>
