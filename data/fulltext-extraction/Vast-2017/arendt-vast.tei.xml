<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Generating insight about how a system is changing over time is a primary purpose of visual analytics. However, there are many ways that change can be defined and represented, and not all visualization techniques lead the analyst to identical, equivalent, or even correct insights. Sometimes understanding change means understanding how entities (either literal or abstract) relate to each other collectively over time. Storyline visualization is a compelling way to communicate this type of change, representing entities as converging and diverging lines, with time encoded on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis does not directly encode a value, but conveys that entities are related at a particular time via proximity.</p><p>One challenge associated with storyline visualization is finding a spatial layout that satisfies this design principle while simultaneously reducing visual artifacts (e.g., line crossings, wiggles, and separation). Most of the research on storyline visualization has been directed toward finding effective layout algorithms to reduce these artifacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</p><p>Storyline visualization requires explicitly defined interactions so that related entities can be drawn in tight, evenly spaced bundles in the visualization. Most storyline visualization designs and algorithms assume that line bundles can be placed freely at any y-coordinate as long as bundles do not overlap. It is not generally assumed that the y-coordinate has a consistent meaning over time.</p><p>However, interactions often contain additional context (e.g., state, location, association), which could lead to confusion when two interactions occur at the same y-coordinate but different times have different meanings. Because of the cost of developing storyline layout algorithms, it is worthwhile to know their limitations, which was the motivation for this study. Why develop and optimize complex layout algorithms if the design itself is misleading, or simpler techniques are equally or more effective? This design study is the first to question and empirically evaluate the basic design principle for storyline visualization -we evaluate two design alternatives that require different storyline layout algorithms. We feel this is currently the appropriate dimension to evaluate past research has focused on layout algorithms but neglected exploring the visual design space for storylines. We hope our findings will provide useful guidance to other researchers developing layout algorithms or storyline visualization tools, and inspire new types of storyline layout techniques.</p><p>The main contribution of this paper is the empirical evaluation of this tool with two different storyline design alternatives within our tool. This study employs an existing geospatial visual analytics tool available in an unpublished workshop paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, which briefly describes the tool, layout algorithm, and expert interviews. In our study we found moderately significant differences in user performance suggesting that the y-coordinate should have a consistent meaning over time. However, exit interviews of participants seem to contradict this, as participants reported the traditional layout as being slightly more useful in a subjective questionnaire. Given this surprising outcome, we revised our design criteria for storyline visualization to incorporate the best aspects of both alternatives. We implemented a new storyline visualization algorithm to demonstrate how these new design criteria could be satisfied.</p><p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The remainder of this section discusses the design space of storyline visualization, then motivates and introduces the design alternatives we consider in this study. In Sect. 2 we discuss related work in storyline visualization, which has generally not questioned or considered alternatives to the original storyline visualization design principles. Following this, in Sect. 3, we present the user interface and application used in the design study. Our experimental design and results are presented in Sect. 4, followed by the presentation of our layout algorithms in Sect. 5. We discuss our findings in Sect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref>. This section also contains design recommendations leading to our redesigned storyline visualization layout algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">The Design Space of Storyline Visualization</head><p>Storylines are used to represent how individuals interact over time. Typically this data is represented as a series of interaction groups, an example of which is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Individuals can be placed in at most one interaction group at any given time step, and the x-axis is used to encode time steps. Each individual is represented as a line, and two storylines are drawn in close proximity (in the y-direction) if they are in the same interaction groups at the same time. Typically, individuals within an interaction groups are drawn with equal vertical spacing. If two individuals are not interacting, they should be drawn farther apart than any individuals who are interacting. Therefore, the storyline layout problem is to determine the y-coordinate of each storyline in a manner that achieves these design principles. For brevity, we will refer to the assignment of a y-coordinate to each individual at each time step as "the layout."</p><p>Assuming these design principles as constraints, sophisticated layout algorithms have been developed to produce a visually appealing layout by optimizing a set of aesthetic criteria. These criteria suggest removing layout artifacts including line crossings, wiggles, and separation, as well as reducing the overall height of the drawing <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. These aesthetic criteria draw largely from established aesthetic criteria for graph drawing <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and are based on assumptions that crossing lines make the visualization cluttered and difficult  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">0  lobby lobby  cafe  1  taxi  taxi  cafe  cafe  2  taxi  taxi  cafe  cafe  3  taxi  cafe  cafe  cafe  4  taxi  shop  shop  taxi  theater  5  taxi  lobby lobby  theater  theater</ref> to read, and straight lines (i.e. without wiggles) make individual lines easier to trace. Line crossings are typically reduced first by the layout algorithm, suggesting that algorithm designers consider this criteria to be the most important -some layout algorithms we surveyed only reduce line crossings. In the past, layout algorithm designers have made tradeoffs on design principles, aesthetic criteria, and optimization techniques to calculate the storyline layout at different qualities and speeds. While interesting, these tradeoffs are not the focus of our design study. Instead we ask a more fundamental question, namely, should the y-coordinate in a storyline visualization have a meaningful and consistent interpretation over time? To help answer this question, we introduce the concept of interaction context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Interaction Context</head><p>If we allow each interaction group at each time step to contain an additional piece of information -the interaction context -we can encode this context on the y-axis. Often this additional information is available. For example, storyline visualizations have been used to show how people move from place to place, and interactions are defined by two people being at the same place and time. In this case the interaction context is simply the location associated with an interaction group. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows how the interaction groups in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> might be transformed into an alternative representation if context is available. This representation is more structured and forces entities to belong to exactly one group per time step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Design Alternatives</head><p>With our definition of interaction context, we can now articulate the design alternatives we explore in this study. The first design alternative we refer to as the "aesthetic layout," which assumes the traditional storyline visualization design principles and aesthetic criteria. The aesthetic layout represents interaction groups (i.e., without context encoded spatially), and relies on an optimization algorithm to reduce crossings, wiggles, and whitespace.</p><p>The second design alternative we refer to as the "layered layout." This is a non-traditional storyline layout where the interaction context is encoded directly on the y-axis, equally spaced. Because of this, lines representing individuals with the same interaction context and time step are over-plotted at the same (x, y) coordinates. This layout relies on an algorithm to reduce crossings by optimizing the order of interaction contexts on the y-axis. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> shows an illustration comparing these two design alternatives for the example interaction groups and contexts we described above.</p><p>Other designs can also communicate interaction context. Existing storyline visualizations can be annotated with their interaction context <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>, but this causes clutter if every context is shown, so some discretion must be used in determining what to show. Alternatively, scarf plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> and other related visualizations represent context with colored sequences of shapes (e.g., rectangles). These plots can be stacked vertically to support comparison across entities, but this becomes problematic when comparing entities that are far apart in the visualization. This could be addressed by re-ordering the entities to put similar entities together.</p><p>Much research has been conducted exploring the design space of storyline layout algorithms with the goal of producing artistic quality storyline visualizations in a reasonable amount time. This research was initially inspired by an XKCD web comic 1 titled "Movie Narrative Charts," that depicts the plots of several well known movies in terms of character interactions using storylines. The comic does not explicitly encode interaction context on the y-axis, but does represent some important interaction contexts by annotating the drawing. Other research in storyline visualization has investigated different applications of storylines for visualizing dynamic topic models, dynamic graphs, and multivariate time series.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Layout Algorithms</head><p>Kim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> claims inspiration from the storyline web comic, but made assumptions that limited the generalizability of the technique to special types of interactions to facilitate a simpler and faster layout algorithm. Ogawa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> were also inspired by the web comic, but their algorithm produced layouts with significantly worse aesthetic qualities (e.g., line crossings and wiggles) and longer runtimes compared to later works.</p><p>More recent research showed that artistic quality storyline layouts can be rendered much more quickly <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. These modern approaches use constrained quadratic programming to solve a significant portion of the layout problem, which can be seen as disadvantageous for web-based visualization. In practice, this approach would require a dedicated server to host the numerical solver used by the layout algorithm as a service.</p><p>Silva <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> developed a force-directed storyline layout algorithm for interactive visualization of text variants. Recently, Gronemann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> developed an algorithm to quickly compute a minimal crossing layout of a storyline visualization. On test data containing up to hundreds of interactions and lines, their algorithm completed on the order of seconds to minutes depending on the complexity of the data. The aforementioned layout techniques spatially encode interaction groups (instead of interaction contexts), so we would categorize them as following the "aesthetic" design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Text Analytics</head><p>Storylines have been used several times recently to show how themes and topics change over time in text and social media. ThemeDelta <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> visualizes dynamic topic models. The layout algorithm uses sorting to decrease crossings, but does not attempt to improve line straightness by removing wiggles. EvoRiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and RoseRiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> are also recently developed visualization tools to understand dynamic topic models. These tools use Sankey diagrams which are closely related to storyline visualization. These above techniques for dynamic topic visualization do not have a consistent interpretation for the y-coordinate over time and would be more closely related to our "aesthetic" design alternative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Dynamic Graphs</head><p>Storyline visualization has been applied widely in the area of dynamic graph visualization. Storylines can be used to understand dynamic graphs at a coarse grained level by visualizing how communities change over time. The tool by Reda et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> uses a technique for dynamic community detection that produces community labels for nodes that are consistent over time. Their visualization encodes the interaction context and resembles our "layered" design alternative, but their layout algorithm does not directly address any aesthetic criteria. Instead, the order of interaction contexts (communities) and storylines (nodes) is simply determined by sorting these entities by their properties. Thus, their storyline view has many crossings and is difficult to interpret. Vehlow et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> developed a similar tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> http://xkcd.com/657 for visualizing dynamic community evolution. This tool does not have a consistent y-coordinate, but does optimize the order of communities within time windows to decrease crossings. Rosvall and Bergstrom <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> use a Sankey diagram to similar effect for dynamic community visualization, but simply sort communities by size at each time step.</p><p>Storyline visualization has also been used to understand fine grained network evolution. Dwyer and Eades <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> used a 3-D forcedirected technique to visualize dynamic graphs that is reminiscent of storyline visualization, where nodes are displayed as "columns" or "worms," and edges represent discrete flow or transactions between nodes. Arendt and Blaha <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> used storylines to represent a temporal network (i.e., contact sequence), where curved arcs representing events connect the associated nodes over time. This approach optimized the layout for crossings, wiggles, and whitespace.</p><p>Several tools leveraging storyline-like representations exist for visualizing dynamic ego-networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. Post et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> use storylines to communicate how packets flow through a software defined network. In this case the network hierarchy is encoded on the y-axis, and this technique is closest to our "layered" design alternative. Many other techniques can be used for dynamic graph visualization. Interested readers should consult the review paper by Vehlow et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. To the best of the authors knowledge, the tools by Reda et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and Post et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> are the only storyline visualizations of dynamic graphs that encode interaction context spatially, allowing the y-coordinate to be consistent over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Multivariate Time Series</head><p>Storyline-like visualizations have also been used to visualize multivariate time-series data. In this case "interactions" are analogous to two entities being similar in the multivariate space. Crnovrsanin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> use principal components analysis (PCA) to project spatial trajectory data onto one principal component which is encoded on the y-axis. The aforementioned techniques have a consistent interpretation of the y-coordinate over time.</p><p>Storyline-like visualization techniques have also been applied to visualize eye-tracking data, a special case of multivariate time-series visualization. Balint et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> used storylines to show when multiple participants were exhibiting the same pattern of behavior while observing dynamic stimuli (i.e. viewing movies). Lowe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> used multidimensional scaling to calculate the y-coordinate of the time-series data to show patterns in scan paths for video stimuli. Stimuli in eye tracking data can be segmented into areas of interest (AOI's) to abstract away from the raw (x, y) gaze data. Raschke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> developed a parallel scan path visualization technique to show how participants' gazes interact over time at AOI's. This technique is noteworthy because the AOI is encoded on the x-axis, so this approach resembles our layered design alternative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">USER INTERFACE</head><p>We sought to understand differences in the design alternatives in a visual analytics context, so we avoided designing a study with static visualizations, which would highlight the perceptual differences between the layouts. Instead, we decided to leverage an existing storyline visualization tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for exploring geo-temporal data. The tool was designed to let users explore behavioral patterns in GPS data from the VAST Challenge 2014 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Specifically, the tool shows when two or more entities exhibit very similar patterns of places visited within a particular time window, depending on the time scale selected by the user. At the most fine-grained time scale available in the tool, it shows when two entities are at the same place at the same time. The tool uses these similar patterns of places visited as the interaction contexts for the storyline visualization. This tool allowed us to ask more challenging questions that could not be answered simply by visual inspection of storyline visualizations. In this screenshot of the storyline tool used in our design study the user has zoomed in on a particular day, filtered out some employees, based on type, and selected a bundle of individuals during lunch time. The map shows where they left from (GASTech) and where they went to (a cafe to the northwest). Frame A (Breadcrumbs): Our tool lets the user explore the data at different time granularities. The breadcrumbs show what time ranges the user has zoomed into. Frame B (Controls): The user can change the selection, the visible storylines, and the time granularity using the controls toolbar. Frame C (Storyline Visualization): Entities' similarity over time are shown with the storyline visualization. In this view, the aesthetic design alternative is shown. When the layered design alternative is used, it replaces this view but the remainder of the interface remains the same. Frame D (Map): The locations and trajectories of individuals are plotted on the map to provide geospatial context. Frame E (Entities): The user can select items on the map, storyline visualization, entities list, or legend. Selection is linked across all of these views. Frame F (Legend): This shows the breakdown of visible entities by employment type, and shows the relationship between the storyline color and the employment type. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref> describes the features of our storyline visualization tool. It contains a primary storyline visualization view, a secondary geospatial trajectory view, and supporting text views for managing selections of individuals. The storyline view shows which individuals are behaving similarly at a given time. The user can explore different time scales by zooming in on the storyline view. At the most fine grained time scale, a two hour time range is broken into 10 minute increments, and the storylines show when two individuals are at the same general area at the same time. At the coarsest grained time view, the user sees two weeks of data with one day time steps. In this case an interaction group represents a set of individuals having a similar distribution of places they visited that day.</p><p>Selecting places or groups selects all individuals present in those places or groups who are visible in the current view. The user can filter out individuals not relevant to their exploration by clicking the filter button, which removes all unselected individuals from the current view. Whenever the view is zoomed or filtered, we show this history for the user with breadcrumbs visible above the storyline view to help the user manage the changes they have made to the view. The breadcrumbs provide the user with information about the past and current views, including how many entities are visible, what time range is shown, and the time granularity.</p><p>Places are abstracted from exact (x, y) coordinates to general neighborhoods (e.g., a commercial district, GASTech, a golf course, etc.). The map view shows the exact (x, y) coordinate and trajectories of selected individuals. Individuals are color-coded by employment type. A legend view explains this coding and allows all individuals of a particular type to be selected. Individuals can also be selected in the map and storyline views by clicking on them directly, or clicking on the group or neighborhood they belong to. Selections across these views are linked to help the user understand spatiotemporal patterns by showing how storylines correlate to individuals changes in locations and vice versa.</p><p>We believe this tool was sufficient for evaluating our design alternatives in a visual analytics context because it readily revealed patterns of life as well as anomalies at multiple time scales. The tool is identical for both design alternatives aside from the y-coordinate determined by the layout algorithm. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref> compares the aesthetic and layered design alternatives in two cases, one at a coarse grained time granularity, and another at a fine grained time granularity. These comparisons show some of the ways that the same data can have different visual appearances in the design alternatives. At the coarse grained time scale, this difference is subtle because most individuals are not changing frequently. At the fine grained time scale, the differences are more obvious. The aesthetic layout visually reveals the volume of individuals within groups, but the layered layout appears to be more truthful about individuals locations. This is apparent with two individuals whose lines are completely straightened by the aesthetic layout algorithm, but, in fact, these individuals change locations about halfway through the view. This change is only apparent with the layered design alternative. This shows two comparisons of the storyline design alternatives. For each example, the aesthetic layout is placed above the layered layout. The callouts with blue backgrounds were added for illustrative purposes and are not part of the user interface. Frame A shows interactions at a coarse grained time scale over a two week period. This is the initial overview storyline view that users first see in the interface, and the two alternative designs appear fairly similar to each other. Frame B shows interactions at a fine grained time scale as individuals are leaving GASTech after work. The aesthetic layout allows the viewer to judge the volume of individuals in interaction groups more easily than the layered layout (the reader should compare B1.1 to B2.1). However, the layered layout accentuates an individual who changes locations around 17:20. In the aesthetic layout the line remain straight (the reader should compare B1.2 to B2.2).</p><p>We evaluated the design alternatives by conducting a controlled user study with qualitative and quantitative user feedback and informal interviews with experts. In a between-subjects user study, we measured the performance of users across design alternatives for two types of tasks. We elicited subjective feedback from these participants about the visualization tool. Our interviews with experts were aimed at understanding what parts of the tool the experts found confusing or useful, why this was the case, and eliciting ways the experts thought the tool could be improved.</p><p>We made several decisions to limit the scope of the study. First, we were primarily interested in how the layout algorithm could help or hinder a user's interpretation of interaction context in the visualization. While this obviously led to our two design alternatives, we also ruled out showing interaction context directly on the either visualization because this would confound our results. Second, we were interested in understanding users performing complex visual analytics tasks with interactive tools, so we ruled out conducting a perceptual study on static visualizations with simple tasks. Finally, we did not evaluate different layout algorithms within the same design condition. We believe fundamental questions surrounding the design of storylines are currently more in need of empirical evaluation than different layout techniques for the same design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">User Study Design</head><p>We conducted a between-subjects controlled user study to understand differences between our design alternatives. This study was approved by our Institutional Review Board and all human participants gave verbal informed consent. Participants were systematically assigned into two groups (aesthetic and layered) using a pre-randomized list, corresponding to one of the two storyline layout design alternatives. They were seated at a standard workstation with a dual monitor setup. Our user interface was placed on the left monitor, fullscreen, and the study questionnaire (written with Google Forms) was placed on the right monitor, fullscreen.</p><p>Participants were prompted to answer questions from our task taxonomy one at a time, in a randomized order per participant. After completing the questions, participants were asked to self report (5-point Likert scale, where 1=Strongly Disagree and 5=Strongly Agree) on the difficulty of the tasks, the usefulness of the various components of the visualization, and the usefulness of the visualization overall. We did not conduct a formal pilot study. However, prior to the study the questions and user interface were reviewed by a team of User Experience experts, who collectively did not identify any significant issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Tasks and Metrics</head><p>To measure user performance quantitatively, we created 18 questions (see <ref type="table">Tab.</ref> 3) based on existing task taxonomies for dynamic network visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. We were looking for differences between the aesthetic and layered design alternatives. Answers to questions were either people (what), places (where), or times (when), mirroring the task taxonomy dimensions described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. We augmented these taxonomies with additional tasks based on new capabilities created by our visualization. Then, we assigned each question into one of two broad groups, "detail" oriented questions or "overview" oriented questions. Detail oriented questions required the user to retrieve specific information about people, places, or times. These questions are best solved by using the filter controls to de-clutter the visualization. Overview oriented questions asked users to make judgements about patterns or trends occurring over time, involving multiple entities and exercise the storyline visualization.</p><p>We phrased questions in a multiple choice (choose exactly one answer), or multiple answer (choose one or more answer) format to facilitate scoring of participants' responses. In some cases we asked questions in a multiple answer format with many choices (around 8 to 10) with the correct answer spanning several options to discourage reverse engineering the answer from the choices. Because of this question format, we took a more nuanced approach with scoring participants' responses by measuring precision and recall for each question. Assuming the user's response is R, and the ground truth is T , we find precision = |R ∩ T | • |R| −1 and recall = |R ∩ T | • |T | −1 . In other words, precision is the fraction of the user's responses that were correct, whereas recall is the fraction of the ground truth the user was able to discover.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Exit Interview</head><p>After participants completed the questions, we asked them to report on the difficulty of the task and the utility of the visualization tool. Participants responded on a 5 point Likert scale with 1 being least difficult/useful, and 5 being most difficult/useful. Because the visualization tool includes several complicated components, we asked participants to describe the utility of the tool as a whole, as well as the utility of the map and storyline visualizations independently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Participants</head><p>We conducted a power analysis to inform the size of the study. Sample size analysis with power set at 0.9 indicated a chance of detecting a large effect size with a study population of 22 participants. Our test assumed a true mean of 9 (indicating that a participant could at random get 9 out of 18 questions correct) and a sample mean of 14, indicating that a particular visualization significantly affected a user's ability to correctly answer questions. We recruited 22 participants from a variety of technical backgrounds within our organization to participate in the study. Because of the availability and cost of using our own employees for the experiment, we did not recruit beyond what was recommended by the power analysis.</p><p>More than 80% of our participants were over 30 years old, and none were under 18 years old. Four of our participants reported being previously familiar with the VAST Challenge 2014. We do not believe this would have given these participants an unfair advantage because our questions asked about specific details of the data that are not likely remembered (as opposed to information pertaining to the overall solution to the challenge). 50% of participants reported having little experience with visualization (1-2 on a 5-point Likert scale). They took between 45 minutes and 1 hour to complete the experiment regardless of visualization type.</p><p>Before the experiment was conducted we noted that some people expressed difficulty conceptualizing the fact that the storyline visualization is representing similar behavior over time at certain time scales, and not necessarily showing that people are in the same exact place at the same time. Because of this, we were explicit in describing the storyline visualization to participants and each of them reported that they understood the concept before the tasks began.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">User Study Results</head><p>Before running the analysis, we first checked the distribution of precision and recall across questions, We found that a few questions were problematic. Questions 13 and 14 had very low average precision and recall (&lt; 0.5 for each) for both design alternatives compared to the averages for the rest of the questions (&gt; 0.5 for the remaining questions). The experiment administrator reported that subjects had asked for guidance in answering these questions such as "what do you mean by behaving most similarly?" and the administrator had trouble clarifying this without coaching participants on how to answer. This leads us to believe that questions 13 and 14 were either poorly worded or required an overly subjective answer by participants, so these questions were omitted from the analysis. Question 8 was answered correctly (precision= 1, recall= 1) by all participants across both design alternatives, so we also omitted this question from the analysis.  <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> shows the average precision and recall for each question. We do not test for significance on a per-question basis because of the small study population, but this figure shows that the mean precision and recall were higher for the layered design alternative for many questions. To quantitatively compare design alternatives, we aggregated user responses across task types to get an average precision and recall for each task type and user. <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> shows a box and whisker summary of this aggregated data. These plots indicate differences in the response distributions between the design alternatives for the overview task. Precision and recall scores were found to be skewed and non-normally distributed, necessitating the use of the the Mann-Whitney U two-tailed non-parametric test to identify significant differences between design alternatives. A Mann-Whitney U test indicated that precision in the overview task was greater for the layered design alternative (Mdn = .875) than for the aesthetic design alternative (Mdn = .625), U = 25.5, p = .021. A Mann-Whitney U test indicated that recall in the overview task was greater for the layered design alternative (Mdn = .875) than for the aesthetic design alternative (Mdn = .625), U = 29.5, p = .043.</p><p>Our exit interview questions, summarized in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>, did not reveal strong differences in opinion of the participants between the aesthetic and layered design alternatives. Several participants reported the highest value for storyline and overall utility in the aesthetic layout, whereas none of the participants reported this for the layered layout. Participants' impressions of the overall tool may be more closely related to their impressions of the storyline view, because we do not see the same pattern for the utility of the map. Opinions about the utility of the map have greater variability than opinions about the utility of the storyline view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Expert Feedback</head><p>We also solicited feedback from three expert analysts at our organization who we thought could benefit from our research. We met with analysts in two different sessions lasting 1 hour each.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Technical Analyst</head><p>We solicited feedback from a technical analyst who described her responsibilities as including the investigation of the collective movement patterns of individuals. The analyst commented that the VAST Challenge 2014 scenario was very similar to the types investigations she performs. She commented that the tool is valuable because it makes it easy to see who goes to the same places together, and that abnormal behaviors are visible. She also commented that our color  <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: On a per-question basis, for many questions the mean precision and recall for the layered design is higher.</p><p>scheme was helpful, and that she employs a similar technique where she manually assigns colors to entities based on their attributes. The analyst had a few comments about how the general usability of our visualization might be improved. She suggested that while it is helpful to know that two or more entities have similar behavior, analysts may want to know what that behavior is, or when an entity has assumed a particular behavior. She suggested the layered design alternative (with spatially encoded behaviors) would be helpful in this circumstance. She also said that she would like to be able to assign colors to locations on the map (i.e., regions of interest). She pointed out that it was difficult to understand time from the geospatial map alone, which has no explicit time encoding, and she suggested adding a tooltip for the map to show the time interval that a particular entity visited a particular location.</p><p>The technical analyst had several suggestions to make our visualization more effective for her use cases. She said that usually she is interested in seeing what behaviors are abnormal, but this would require some knowledge about a baseline. She asked for the capability to train a behavioral classification model on historical data, allowing behavioral anomalies to be indicated on the visualization. She said it would be especially helpful if there was a way to notify the user that an anomaly was buried deeper in the visualization (at a finer time granularity) so that she knew when she should look deeper. Overview <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>: For both metrics there is a moderately significant difference (p &lt; .05) between design alternatives for the "overview" task. Participants using the layered design performed better.  <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>: Participants showed little differences across conditions in subjective responses (on a 5 point Likert scale) taken during exit interviews. However, no participant gave the layered design alternative the highest rating for either overall or storyline utility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Cyber Researchers</head><p>We also solicited feedback from two cyber researchers who attended the interview session together. Based on past interactions with cyber researchers at our institution, we thought that our tool could be adapted to the cyber domain, and that cyber researchers would be receptive to novel visualizations. Broadly speaking, cyber researchers are interested in understanding patterns and anomalies in the way a complex system changes over time. That system comprises of many entities (e.g., machines) with changing states, and understanding the collective dynamics of the system is important -the system is not effectively understood by studying its components in isolation. Therefore, we believe that our storyline visualization tool can be adapted effectively for the cyber domain if an appropriate state representation (i.e., interaction context) can be found. Furthermore, we believe that there is potential for significant impact by developing useful and novel visualizations for cyber researchers and analysts. We adapted our tool for the cyber researchers to visualize NetFlow data available in the VAST Challenge 2013. Storylines represented machines instead of individuals; latitude and longitude were replaced with summary statistics about each machine's behavior in 30 minute intervals. These summary statistics (i.e., dispersion and smoothness) were chosen because of existing published work that evaluated these metrics on the same dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The cyber analysts were shown the original tool with the geo-spatial data, and then subsequently shown the modified tool using the NetFlow data.</p><p>The cyber analysts were very excited by the VAST Challenge 2014 geospatial case study. They reported that understanding individuals' patterns of life is a good metaphor for understanding how machines in a cyber network change over time, and that they would like to see this visualization appropriately applied to their problem domain. However, when shown the cyber data within our visualization the analysts had mixed reactions. With the aesthetic design alternative, the analysts were initially confused that a straight line in the visualization didn't necessarily correspond to constant behavior and vice versa. After explaining this further, as well as showing the layered design alternative to the analysts, they reported that both versions of the layout would be beneficial, and would like to have the capability to switch between them as needed.</p><p>The analysts commented that our visualization of the cyber data didn't appear to have enough context for the analysts to sufficiently understand the network. The critical difference appeared to be that the geospatial view with the cyber data lacked annotations equivalent to the VAST Challenge 2014 version. The analysts could see what machines in the networks appeared to be behaving anomalously, but the visualization didn't have enough information to explain the meaning of the pattern. This could be improved by adding additional details on demand for behaviors to help communicate their meaning when true geospatial context is not available. The analysts suggested that behaviors should be chosen more intuitively, and could take into account more features in the NetFlow such as bytes up/down. They suggested the visualization should have interaction groups defined on known low-level signatures, both normal and abnormal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">STORYLINE LAYOUT IMPLEMENTATIONS</head><p>Existing algorithms for storyline visualization, in the authors' opinion, were ad hoc, too slow, did not optimize all established aesthetic criteria, or required proprietary convex solvers. For these above limitations, and to ensure better experimental control, we developed our own layout algorithms, which we describe below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Aesthetic Layout Algorithm</head><p>Like most existing storyline layout algorithms, our aesthetic layout algorithm is an approximate algorithm, making a tradeoff between complexity and quality -it completes in a reasonable amount of time because it does not guarantee that it will a globally optimal storyline layout. To do so, we take a multi-stage multi-objective optimization approach. In each stage a single aesthetic objective is optimized, and the result from the current stage is respected by the subsequent stages. Wherever possible, we have attempted to match the subproblems in each stage with existing algorithms in the literature. Our algorithm, illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>, finds the storyline layout by reducing crossings then wiggles then whitespace.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Reduce Crossings Across Groups</head><p>A layered directed acyclic graph G f low is constructed (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 7a</ref>) to model the flow of storylines between interaction groups. Each vertex represents an interaction group, and each edge represents the flow between interaction groups at adjacent time steps. The weight of this edge is the number of storylines that flow between the groups. For example, a storyline with interaction context u at time t and v at time t + 1 contributes a weight of 1 to the edge (u t , v t+1 ) in G f low . Each vertex belongs to the layer corresponding to its time window, so only the order of the vertices within each layer determines the number of crossings in the layout.</p><p>There are several techniques known to reduce edge crossings between layers of a directed acyclic graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. For our implementation, we used the median heuristic <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> for an initial ordering then refined this by swapping adjacent vertices within layers that would decrease edge crossings the most when swapped. This is repeated until no more beneficial swaps can be performed. After this, the order of the storylines within interaction groups is found similarly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Reduce Wiggles</head><p>After the group and storyline orders are found, we reduce unnecessary line wiggles by finding a maximal set of edges in G f low to align. An edge (u, v) in G f low contains one or more storylines moving from groups u to groups v in adjacent time windows. Given the order of the storylines determined in the previous stage of the algorithm, we can find the best hypothetical offset between u and v. This is the offset that has the fewest wiggles, or, equivalently, straightens the most storylines between u and v. We construct the alignment graph G align where each vertex in G align was an edge in G f low . Each vertex (u, v) in G align is weighted by the number of storylines that would be straightened if groups u and v were aligned. Next, we add edges to G align to represent alignment conflictswhen an edge is aligned, its endpoints are placed at the same height, but we must ensure that aligning an edge does not change the order of the vertices found previously. Only one in-and out-edge can be aligned per group vertex. If two edges in G f low cross, only one of those edges can be aligned. Finding the maximum weighted independent set of G align is equivalent to finding the largest number of edges in G f low to align (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 7c</ref>). For this, we use a simple greedy algorithm that produces high quality approximations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3">Reduce Whitespace</head><p>The final stage in our layout algorithm is to solve for the ycoordinates of the groups in a manner that respects the order and alignment found in the previous two stages. We construct another directed acyclic graph G whitespace whose vertices are the connected components of the subgraph induced from only the aligned edges found previously and whose edges enforce the ordering found previously. Layering G whitespace solves for the y-coordinate of the groups, and subsequently the storylines; there are many algorithms to compute layerings for directed acyclic graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and we solve this using the Network Simplex algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Layered Layout Algorithm</head><p>Our implementation of the layered layout algorithm follows a similar setup to our aesthetic layout algorithm. However, instead of representing the flow between adjacent interaction groups with G f low , we model the flow between each interaction context, which exist across time steps. For example, a storyline with interaction context u at time t and v at time t + 1 contributes a weight of 1 to the edge (u, v) in G f low . G f low is seriated using the same technique as above to find a suitable ordering that decreases crossings. <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref> illustrates how a seriation of G f low for interaction contexts yields a linear ordering with decreased crossings. The y-coordinate of each interaction context is found directly from this ordering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DISCUSSION</head><p>User performance aggregated over the detail oriented tasks was not distinguishable across design alternatives, but was statistically distinguishable for overview tasks. The significance and size of the difference in performance of the layered design alternative surprised us. Before the experiment, we were suspicious the layered alternative had detrimental properties (e.g., over-plotting, more line crossings) that would cause it to perform worse compared to the aesthetic layout. However, we believe the interactivity of the tool allowed users to overcome these issues. For example, although the user could not determine purely by visual inspection how many entities were within a group at a given time, this was easily determined by hovering over or clicking on the group. This is perhaps why participants reported the aesthetic layout to be more usable -because it required less interaction -even though they performed worse with it. The tool's interactivity, including the ability to zoom in to different times, could have led to large variances in participants' viewing and exploring behavior. Had our design study been conducted with a less interactive or fully functional tool, we could have seen different results. But, this would reflect less how visual analytics tools are used, so we believe our results are more generalizable.</p><p>The layered design alternative also had some other accidental but beneficial qualities. For example, the over-plotting tended to result in less complicated visualizations that highlighted behavior changes. The even spacing between layers also made the alternate layout more predictable, and perhaps easier to visually digest. The layout also appeared to be more in line with users initial assumption that a straight line meant constant behavior. On the other hand, for the aesthetic design alternative, the experimenter had to take extra care to dispel this notion for participants in the new layout group. This confusion was also experienced when we solicited feedback from our experts. We believe a combination of the layered design being less visually complex and more easily explainable to participants led to its significantly better performance.</p><p>A possible limitation of our study is that it may not have contained enough different types of questions to reveal all of the benefits of the aesthetic design alternative -perhaps our choice of questions could have been unintentionally biased to favor the layered design alternative. However, <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> shows that participants, on average, performed better with the layered design alternative across many of these questions, which ask about a variety of behaviors, people, places, and times. Participants also performed better, on average, across many of the detail questions, but not enough to show a significant difference. Also, after enough practice, it is possible that participants could have become more proficient with the aesthetic design alternative. Additionally, because of the small study population, effect sizes could be exaggerated <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and the results may not be applicable to a more general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Nonetheless, we believe our interpretations are valid because (1) they are, in retrospect, consistent with our knowledge about the strength of spatial encodings in visualization, (2) they are supported by the feedback provided by our expert analysts, and (3) they were derived from an evaluation conducted with a functional visual analytics tool with users performing a variety of non-trivial tasks. We redesigned our layout algorithm based on lessons learned from our study. The y-coordinate encodes the interaction context (the location of the interaction) and is consistent over time. Lines within interaction groups are not over-plotted, and crossings are further reduced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Design Recommendations</head><p>This outcome forced us to revisit storyline visualization design principles. We realized that users are bringing their own biases to storyline visualizations, and this may lead to misinterpretation. Rather than working against these biases by requiring users to un-learn engrained habits, for future work we are designing storyline visualizations to work with these biases. Therefore, we make the following design recommendations (in subjective order of importance).</p><p>Present context... Interactions generally have context, even the original XKCD comic annotated some interactions with contextual information (e.g., location). Storyline visualizations don't stand on their own without context.</p><p>But, be sure to preserve context. The interpretation of the ycoordinate does matter, and should be consistent over time. If interaction contexts are not available, consider using analytics (e.g., unsupervised learning) to synthesize interaction contexts by grouping together similar interaction groups at different times.</p><p>Optimizing aesthetics is important... Aesthetic criteria should still be addressed by reducing layout artifacts (e.g., crossings, wiggles, whitespace), but this should respect the above recommendations.</p><p>But, sacrifice quality for speed. Interactive visualizations benefit from responsive layout algorithms by allowing the user to answer questions more rapidly. A small loss in the quality of the storyline layout could create a large benefit to the user if this makes the layout algorithm more responsive.</p><p>Sometimes over-plotting is OK. When a large number of storylines are being drawn, over-plotting lines may help the user by simplifying the visualization, possibly allowing the bigger picture to be understood more readily. This may also emphasize outliers and deviations better than the alternative. This could also support an overview to detail workflow if over-plotted storylines are shown in the overview, then separated storylines are shown in the detail view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Redesign</head><p>Following our own recommendations, we have begun designing and implementing an improved storyline layout algorithm. We build on the design by Reda et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, which partitions the y-axis into layers (i.e., interaction contexts) and does not over-plot lines. However, Reda et al. did not provide a technique to improve the readability of the visualization by optimizing aesthetic criteria.</p><p>To do so, first we reduce crossings using the algorithm for the layered design alternative described in Sect. 5.2. We then adjust the order of the storylines within each layer to further reduce crossings. We construct a directed graph G bias to represent the tendency for one storyline to be above another given the ordering found previously. Given two storylines u and v, the weight of their edge w(u, v) is the number of times u appears in a layer above v less the reverse.</p><p>If w(u, v) &lt; 0, the sign is negated and the direction of the edge is reversed, and edges where w(u, v) = 0 are removed from G bias . Then G bias is ordered to reduce crossings by solving the Feedback Arc Set (FAS) problem using the greedy approximation proposed by Eades et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Finally, storylines within interaction groups are sorted by this ordering and centered within each interaction group. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 9</ref> shows our redesigned storyline visualization applied to a slice of the VAST Challenge 2014 data. In this view, the y-coordinate encodes the interaction context (the location of the interaction) and is meaningful and consistent over time. The interaction context is also redundantly encoded with the background color in each layer. We believe this new design addresses the largest point of confusion we observed with the aesthetic design. We have implemented this layout algorithm and applied it to understanding eye tracking data <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and contrastive opinion dynamics in social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>Storyline visualization is a powerful technique for communicating how entities are interacting over time. Previous research on storyline visualization has assumed, either implicitly or explicitly, that directly optimizing the aesthetic criteria (e.g., crossings and wiggles) leads to more usable visualizations. Evaluations of past work have been approached by comparing the aesthetic quality of drawings produced by different layout algorithms without measuring user performance. To the authors' knowledge, our work contains the first empirical study to question the underlying design principles of storyline visualization, and to quantify the differences of storyline layout algorithms in terms of user performance. The results of our study suggest that when interaction context is important, the y-coordinate can encode this context and should have a consistent interpretation over time.</p><p>For future work, we will be refining our redesigned storyline visualization algorithms and developing a JavaScript storyline visualization library with the goal of producing artistic quality layouts at interactive speeds (&lt; 100ms) within a web browser. We believe the availability of such a library would open up storyline visualization techniques researchers who want to apply the technique to novel applications, but do not have the expertise or resources to implement their own layout algorithms. This would also enable researchers to conduct additional design studies to answer new questions, including those we considered outside the scope of this paper.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: In this screenshot of the storyline tool used in our design study the user has zoomed in on a particular day, filtered out some employees, based on type, and selected a bundle of individuals during lunch time. The map shows where they left from (GASTech) and where they went to (a cafe to the northwest). Frame A (Breadcrumbs): Our tool lets the user explore the data at different time granularities. The breadcrumbs show what time ranges the user has zoomed into. Frame B (Controls): The user can change the selection, the visible storylines, and the time granularity using the controls toolbar. Frame C (Storyline Visualization): Entities' similarity over time are shown with the storyline visualization. In this view, the aesthetic design alternative is shown. When the layered design alternative is used, it replaces this view but the remainder of the interface remains the same. Frame D (Map): The locations and trajectories of individuals are plotted on the map to provide geospatial context. Frame E (Entities): The user can select items on the map, storyline visualization, entities list, or legend. Selection is linked across all of these views. Frame F (Legend): This shows the breakdown of visible entities by employment type, and shows the relationship between the storyline color and the employment type.</figDesc></figure>

For each example, the aesthetic layout is placed above the layered layout. The callouts with blue backgrounds were added for illustrative purposes and are not part of the user interface. Frame A shows interactions at a coarse grained time scale over a two week period. This is the initial overview storyline view that users first see in the interface, and the two alternative designs appear fairly similar to each other. Frame B shows interactions at a fine grained time scale as individuals are leaving GASTech after work. The aesthetic layout allows the viewer to judge the volume of individuals in interaction groups more easily than the layered layout (the reader should compare B1.1 to B2.1). However, the layered layout accentuates an individual who changes locations around 17:20. In the aesthetic layout the line remain straight (the reader should compare B1.2 to B2.2).</figDesc></figure>
