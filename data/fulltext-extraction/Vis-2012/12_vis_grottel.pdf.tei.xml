				<p>Fig. 1. Tilted view on the data set D6 (time step 250) showing a propagating crack. The arrow glyphs depict atoms with induced electrostatic dipole moments, especially noticeable at the crack. Glyphs for atoms with an FA value below 0.6 are filtered to emphasize regions with correlated orientations and non-polar atoms are omitted for a clearer view. Beneath two layers of atoms (2.5 ˚ A) an opaque plane shows the reconstructed scalar field of fractional anisotropy (FA) of the dipole moments. Iso surfaces (FA = 0.68) clearly show wave fronts at the right side of the image, emitted from the crack tip at the left side of the image. Abstract—Metal oxides are important for many technical applications. For example alumina (aluminum oxide) is the most commonly-used ceramic in microelectronic devices thanks to its excellent properties. Experimental studies of these materials are increasingly supplemented with computer simulations. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can reproduce the material behavior very well and are now reaching time scales relevant for interesting processes like crack propagation. In this work we focus on the visualization of induced electric dipole moments on oxygen atoms in crack propagation simulations. The straightforward visualization using glyphs for the individual atoms, simple shapes like spheres or arrows, is insufficient for providing information about the data set as a whole. As our contribution we show for the first time that fractional anisotropy values computed from the local neighborhood of individual atoms of MD simulation data depict important information about relevant properties of the field of induced electric dipole moments. Iso surfaces in the field of fractional anisotropy as well as adjustments of the glyph representation allow the user to identify regions of correlated orientation.

For MD simulations of α-alumina, there exists a highly accurate empirical force field <ref type="bibr" coords="1,424.67,627.14,13.74,8.02" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, which takes into account the electrostatic interactions between charges as well as between induced dipole moments of each oxygen ion.

The domain scientists are <ref type="figure" coords="2,22.50,125.02,18.55,7.37">Fig. 2</ref>.

Arrow glyphs depict the dipole moments of the oxygen atoms, whereas the brightness of their color is scaled by the fractional anisotropy evaluated for local neighborhoods. Additionally, iso surfaces with FA = 0.81 enclose and emphasize regions of highly correlated orientations of the moments. miliar with this representation. Additionally, a scalar field of fractional anisotropy (FA) is derived from the original data to provide an aggregated view of the behavior of the data in a local neighborhood of each particle. This field can be combined with the glyph representations and iso surfaces to help the user identify regions that share correlated orientations of the oxygen atoms' dipoles. Analysis of the dynamic behavior throughout the whole trajectory is performed by viewing an animation of the generated visualizations. This allows for the observation of moving fronts or areas of correlated orientations, i.e. vesicular disorder regions (e.g. see <ref type="figure" coords="2,117.97,250.69,22.79,8.02">fig. 12</ref>) as well as dynamics effects in the fields of the dipoles, like propagating waves (cf. <ref type="figure" coords="2,198.52,260.65,17.30,8.02">fig. 1</ref>). These effects have been observed for the first time in MD simulation data sets. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p> In recent years many advanced visualization methods became established tools in the analysis processes in many sciences. As these methods themselves are quite well understood nowadays, it becomes more and more important for visualization scientists to combine them for solving challenging, larger, and more complex real-world scientific problems, normally in close collaboration with application scien- tists <ref type="bibr" coords="2,39.39,365.92,14.19,8.02" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,56.01,365.92,11.21,8.02" target="#b35"> 37,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,69.66,365.92,10.64,8.02" target="#b19"> 20]</ref>. One example is the work of Laney et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,233.59,365.92,14.94,8.02" target="#b18">[19] </ref>which analyzes the structure of the interface surface between mixing fluids using color coding of this surface as well as a graph presentation of the surface's structure elements, i.e. bubbles. In our work we focus on the visualization of dipole moments of oxygen atoms from MD simulations of crack propagation using multiple visual metaphors for the atoms and for derived scalar field information. The prevalent and most natural visualization technique for the results of MD simulations in most research fields are point-based glyph representations. Traditionally implemented using polygonbased glyphs, generic software packages like AVS <ref type="bibr" coords="2,208.77,466.18,10.45,8.02" target="#b0">[1] </ref>or Amira <ref type="bibr" coords="2,257.93,466.18,14.94,8.02" target="#b36">[38] </ref>can be used to obtain such a visualization. Due to the high geometry load induced by the polygonization of the glyphs, the size of simulations that can be visualized is effectively restricted to small data sets. For some applications more specialized visualization tools like UCSF Chimera <ref type="bibr" coords="2,55.76,515.99,13.74,8.02" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, PyMOL <ref type="bibr" coords="2,107.15,515.99,14.94,8.02">[32] </ref>and VMD <ref type="bibr" coords="2,163.11,515.99,14.94,8.02" target="#b14">[14] </ref>additionally include more abstract representations, like molecular surfaces. Leveraging the computational power of today's GPUs is a driving force for advances in visualization for physical sciences as Lips¸aLips¸a et al. noted <ref type="bibr" coords="2,44.77,556.47,13.74,8.02" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Thus, modern graphics hardware can increase the number of glyphs that can be displayed interactively by ray casting with point sprites. The foundation for this advance, ray casting of perspectively correct ellipsoids in the fragment shader, was laid by Gumhold <ref type="bibr" coords="2,248.83,586.35,14.94,8.02" target="#b12">[12] </ref>in context of tensor field visualization. Klein et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,193.45,596.32,14.94,8.02" target="#b17">[18] </ref> used a similar approach for visualizing magnetic fields and reduced the data transfer per glyph to a single vertex plus a few attributes describing an ellipsoid. Combined with multiple levels of time-coherent particle culling and deferred shading, GPU-based particles pushed the frontier of interactively portrayable atoms towards hundreds of millions on a commodity workstation computer <ref type="bibr" coords="2,104.23,656.09,13.74,8.02" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. Such techniques are now state-of-the-art and are in some form available in many visualization packages, e.g. VMD. Reina and Ertl <ref type="bibr" coords="2,103.63,676.02,14.94,8.02" target="#b30">[31] </ref>extended the method from simple spheres to complex glyphs with higher semantic density for depicting dipoles. Their approach of evaluating all quadratic sub-primitives and then selecting the visible ones on a per-fragment basis was also employed by Grottel et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,71.33,715.87,14.94,8.02" target="#b11">[11] </ref>for ray casting a variety of glyphs including arrow glyphs like the ones used in this work. An area of visualization distantly related to our application is diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which displays the fibre structure of the brain as seen by an MRI scanner. From the field of DTI, we borrow the FA metric for the anisotropy of diffusion <ref type="bibr" coords="2,437.54,180.95,9.52,8.02" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In our application, we use it to determine the homogeneity of the orientation of the oxygen atoms within a confined area. A variety of visualization techniques has been proposed for DTI data sets ranging from direct volume rendering using specifically tailored transfer functions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,476.31,220.80,14.94,8.02" target="#b16">[17] </ref>to different types of glyphs like ellipsoids and superquadrics representing a single diffusion tensor <ref type="bibr" coords="2,358.92,240.73,14.19,8.02" target="#b37">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,376.04,240.73,10.64,8.02"> 15]</ref>. Kindlmann et al.'s hue-balls <ref type="bibr" coords="2,501.02,240.73,14.94,8.02" target="#b15">[16] </ref>have been implemented using a color map defined on a sphere to visualize directions. Our arrow glyphs are colored in a similar way to further emphasize the orientation of the oxygen atoms. The diffusion tensor model is limited to a single-fibre direction in a voxel – a limitation which has been overcome by high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,335.34,300.51,13.74,8.02" target="#b34">[36]</ref>. HARDI acquires many gradient directions equally distributed on a sphere for each voxel, which in turn requires more complex visualization like Q-Ball Imaging <ref type="bibr" coords="2,445.76,320.43,13.74,8.02" target="#b33">[35]</ref>. GPUs can also be used to efficiently render special glyphs for HARDI <ref type="bibr" coords="2,479.33,330.39,13.74,8.02" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Although similar ones might have been used to visualize the anisotropy of the dipole orientation, we opted against this as such glyhps require significant space and therefore would introduce too much visual clutter. Instead the scalar field of FA is displayed directly in a continuous way, which improves perceptibility and additionally can be combined with the original data as arrow glyphs at the same time (cf. <ref type="figure" coords="2,479.62,390.17,17.19,8.02">fig. 4</ref>). For generating our scalar fields, we use a splatting approach <ref type="bibr" coords="2,520.55,400.49,14.94,8.02" target="#b38">[40] </ref> to resample from the topology-free original data set into a regular grid. Computing such density volumes from particle data is a widely used method in the context of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,324.57,440.34,13.74,8.02" target="#b27">[28]</ref> , but is also employed for particle rendering in gen- eral <ref type="bibr" coords="2,301.91,450.31,9.52,8.02" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. Instead of just resampling particles using a reconstruction kernel we directly compute the FA during this process. The iso surfaces we extract from the scalar field to emphasize regions of correlated orientation are computed using the marching tetrahedra algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="2,345.28,490.52,9.52,8.02" target="#b6">[6]</ref>. We prefer it over the more often used marching cubes algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="2,346.82,500.48,14.94,8.02" target="#b22">[23] </ref>as it allows for future extensions to arbitrarily structured grids. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">SIMULATION, DATA, AND VISUALIZATION</head><p>Our application scenario is the investigation of the propagation of cracks in solid, crystalline materials, namely α-alumina. The core question domain scientists want to answer is how the strain situation caused by a propagating crack influences the electrostatic properties of the samples, especially the dipole orientations, and whether the newly developed MD force field <ref type="bibr" coords="2,380.52,593.95,14.94,8.02" target="#b13">[13] </ref> can reproduce effects known from experiments where previous MD force fields failed. In the following, we briefly introduce the simulations that are performed in this context and explain the data sets as well as the visualization techniques we applied to fulfill the domain experts' needs. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Molecular Dynamics with Polarizable Oxygen Ions</head><p> Our visualization works with trajectories from atomistic MD simulations , performed with IMD <ref type="bibr" coords="2,383.41,676.65,13.74,8.02" target="#b31">[33]</ref>. In every time step Newton's equation of motion is solved for each particle by numerical integration. One MD time step corresponds to approximately 1 fs real time. In the case of metal oxides each particle type gets a charge as additional parameter , which yields its electrostatic contribution to the total energy and to the interaction between two particles. As it was recently shown <ref type="bibr" coords="2,518.31,726.46,13.74,8.02" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, an accurate description of crystalline α-alumina can be achieved with <ref type="figure" coords="3,213.94,179.71,3.54,7.37" target="#tab_1">1</ref>) of liquid silica at 3,000 K to test the quality of the newly-developed force field used in the simulations. All arrows move continuously throughout the trajectory and no unrealistic correlated orientation of dipoles occurs. The non-polar silicon atoms are represented as gray spheres. To make the visualization more clear these atoms are usually filtered out. a third parameter – the polarization α – for every oxygen atom and the application of the potential model of Tangney and Scandolo (TS) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,264.69,261.11,13.74,8.02" target="#b32">[34]</ref>. With the TS potential, the total energy and the forces on each particle are calculated in each MD time step during simulation. The TS potential is a sum of two contributions: a short-range pair potential U MS of Morse-Stretch (MS) form (cf. e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,185.13,301.67,14.34,8.02" target="#b32">[34]</ref>) and a long-range part U EL , which describes the electrostatic interactions between charges and induced dipoles of the oxygen atoms. While U MS is a well-known, classical potential for MD simulations, U EL is a recent addition to the force field which needs to be studied in detail <ref type="bibr" coords="3,201.31,341.52,14.94,8.02" target="#b13">[13] </ref>and thus is in the focus of our visualization design decisions. In order to evaluate the electrostatic interactions where dipoles contribute , these dipole moments have to be calculated. As the dipole moments depend on the local electric field of the surrounding charges and dipoles, a self-consistent, iterative solution has to be found in each MD time step. In the TS approach, a dipole moment p p p n i of atom i in iteration step n consists of an induced part p p p IND i from the electric field of the other surrounding dipoles and a short-range part p p p SR i from the field of the nearby charges: </p><formula>p p p n i = p p p IND i (E E E(p p p n−1 j )) + p p p SR i (q j ). </formula><formula>(1) </formula><p>The electric field E E E(p p p n−1 j ) depends on the dipole moments of the previous iteration step. Taking into account the interactions between charges U qq , between dipole moments U pp , and between a charge and a dipole U pq , the total electrostatic contribution is given by </p><formula>U EL = U qq +U pq +U pp , </formula><formula>(2) </formula><p>and the total interaction is </p><formula>U tot = U MS +U EL . </formula><formula>(3) </formula><p>Note that in the TS model only the polarizability of oxygen atoms is allowed to be unequal to zero. The input for our visualization that we eventually get from the MD simulation is a set of atoms for each time step. Each atom i provides solely its position Q Q Q i and the vector p p p i of its dipole moment for the visualization. The simulation is always performed on a threedimensional domain. However, most data sets used in this work use a quite thin simulation area (approximately 207 × 137 × 24Å24˚24Å), and comprise between 400 and 1,000 time steps used by the visualization (cf. table 1). In this thin setup the simulation uses a periodic boundary condition on the z-axis while the other two axes have open boundaries. As a consequence increasing the size in the z-direction would only increase the computational cost of the simulation without changing the results. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Arrow Particles</head><p>The use of glyphs like our arrow glyphs for showing the orientation of dipolar oxygen atoms is common practice for visualizing the results of an MD simulation. Employing a shader-based ray casting technique similar to Reina et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,101.48,96.46,14.94,8.02" target="#b30">[31] </ref>enables us to show a large number of them interactively on commodity graphics hardware. For each glyph a single fragment shader computes the surface of a cone and a cylinder in a dedicated glyph space and chooses the visible fragments. While the arrows provide a familiar visualization of the dipole moments , they are only useful when looking at a rather small area of the data set. It is difficult to convey the behavior of the dipoles on a larger scale as the glyphs themselves get rather small and their shape gets hard to perceive. We therefore colorize the glyphs based on their orientation to remedy this problem (cf. <ref type="figure" coords="4,162.21,186.13,16.89,8.02" target="#fig_0">fig. 3</ref> ): the fact that the normalized direction vectors and color both form a three-dimensional vector space allows a rather direct mapping between them. A similar colorization has been used for DTI visualization before <ref type="bibr" coords="4,213.23,216.01,14.94,8.02" target="#b15">[16] </ref>and enables the user to easily identify areas of correlated orientations in our case. For better perception of the directions of very small glyphs, we switch to flat shading using mainly the color as indicator (cf. <ref type="figure" coords="4,217.70,245.90,17.30,8.02">fig. 2</ref> ). In addition , we reduce the visual clutter by filtering out unimportant arrows based on the scalar field value (cf. figs. 7 and 11). Although this is still not optimal for an overview, glyphs show the actual simulation output and hence are needed as reference for validating the new MD force field and the visualization based on the derived FA field. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Fractional Anisotropy</head><p>A visualization useful for the domain scientists must convey how the strain situation caused by the propagating crack influences the electrostatic properties of the material. Such interactions between mechanical forces and electrostatic properties are difficult to perceive in the established glyph-based visualizations, as the dipole moment information of the atoms must be studied in correlation with the directly surrounding atoms. To better illustrate those effects we utilize the measure of FA to summarize the behavior of the dipole moments within local neighborhoods. Originally, FA is a scalar value computed from the effective diffusion tensor in DTI which measures the part of the tensor that can be ascribed to anisotropic diffusion <ref type="bibr" coords="4,182.92,425.52,9.52,8.02" target="#b1">[2]</ref> . Transferring this approach to our application, we can obtain a value that is an indicator for how correlated the orientation of the oxygen dipoles within a restricted area of the data set is. Computing FA values for a local neighborhood of an atom in our topology-free input data requires either a costly neighborhood search, and thus spatial data structures to make this approach feasible, or the particle data must be aggregated into an common data structure, i.e. a scalar volume on a regular grid. We opted for the second approach as it also gives us the possibility to easily extract and visualize iso surfaces highlighting regions of interest. The FA scalar field is constructed as follows: The volume grid is defined based on the data set size by computing the resolution of the grid from the average distance between atoms, thus roughly mapping one atom onto one voxel. This is approximate as the atoms are not placed on a undistorted rectangular grid and is only feasible since the data sets we are working with are rather small. However, for larger data sets and for more complex scenarios, e.g. which must handle complex atom distributions or atom lattice geometries, any of the well-known methods for advanced volume data representation, e. g. adaptive grid refinement, could be used. For our specific scenario at hand, the current approximation is sufficient, thus we reserved such improvements for future work. Following a scatter approach, we splat the dipole moments information of all atoms into the volume to compute the FA values. Based on the distance d i j = |Q Q Q i − V V V j | between the position Q Q Q i of an atom i and the position V V V j of the voxel j in object space of the respective data sets, a weight w i j for the contribution of the particle to that voxel is calculated as: </p><formula>w i j = 2 d i j r 3 − 3 d i j r 2 + 1 if d i j &lt;= r 0 if d i j &gt; r , </formula><formula>(4) </formula><p>with r being the finite support radius of the function. Please note that any splatting kernel, e. g. a Gauss function, could also have been used. The radius is given in object space of the data set and thus is intuitive to specify for the application scientists. In order to capture the data of the significant neighborhood, we used a value of r = 10Å10˚10Å, which is the cut-off radius for the interaction between particles used by the simulation code (cf. U MS and U EL in section 3.1). For each voxel j, the FA value F j (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,434.29,123.12,10.08,8.02" target="#b1">[2]</ref> ) of its particle neighborhood is computed as: </p><formula>F j = (λ j1 − λ j2 ) 2 + (λ j2 − λ j3 ) 2 + (λ j3 − λ j1 ) 2 2(λ 2 j1 + λ 2 j2 + λ 2 j3 ) , </formula><formula>(5) </formula><p>with λ j1 , λ j2 , and λ j3 being the eigenvalues of the matrix M j formed by the dipole moments p p p i of atoms i: </p><formula>M j = 1 #i ∑ i w i j p p p i ⊗ p p p i , </formula><formula>(6) </formula><p>with #i being the number of atoms i with w i j &gt; 0. During the splatting stage of our algorithm M j is temporarily stored and accumulated for each voxel. The scalar field of F j is computed from M j in a final pass. For directly visualizing the field of FA, we chose the color map depicted in <ref type="figure" coords="4,328.09,406.69,17.88,8.02" target="#fig_1">fig. 5</ref>. It is based on cool-warm shading, but specifically highlights high or low values close to 1 or 0. The rationale behind this is that preliminary observations revealed regions of highly correlated dipole orientations and thus high FA values, which dissolve as the crack propagates and which are of high interest for the domain scientists. The FA values are also used to enhance the direct particle visualization by adjusting the brightness of the glyphs and by filtering the glyphs. The mapping enables the user to easily identify dark areas of low FA, while in areas of high correlation (high FA), the colorization of the glyphs additionally provides a direct indication of how the dipoles are oriented. The aforementioned dissolving of areas of high FA during crack propagation can be observed e.g. in <ref type="figure" coords="4,475.30,516.27,17.31,8.02">fig. 2</ref>. The glyph display can be further enhanced by visually circumscribing the regions where principal orientations emerge using iso surfaces of the FA scalar field. This enhancement is especially useful when watching an animation of the whole trajectory (<ref type="figure" coords="4,455.09,556.13,17.67,8.02">fig. 2</ref>) as it enables the user to see such regions move, disseminate or shrink over time. To avoid occlusion problems, the surface, which is rendered as triangle mesh generated using the marching tetrahedra algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="4,486.68,586.01,9.52,8.02" target="#b6">[6]</ref>, is clipped at the data set boundaries. The iso value (for most images FA = 0.81) can be interactively changed and was chosen by the domain scientists to best separate interesting areas (e.g. waves in <ref type="figure" coords="4,456.46,615.90,18.61,8.02">fig. 1</ref> or vesicular disorder regions in <ref type="figure" coords="4,343.78,625.86,17.11,8.02">fig. 2</ref>). For other data sets other values might be more appropriate. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>To show the effectiveness of our visualization, we use two different classes of data sets: three of the data sets (D1 – D3) serve for validating the simulation methodology and the visualization, i.e. are used to verify whether the simulation exhibits the expected behavior and whether the visualization is able to convey it. The remaining three (D4 – D6) come from the actual application scenario of crack propagation in α-alumina driven by mechanical strain. <ref type="figure" coords="4,463.90,726.46,26.48,8.02" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>summarizes the properties of the data sets. Each of the data sets is rather small for the visualization techniques employed, thus causing no performance issues. All rendering methods are interactive with far more than 60 fps on an Nvidia GeForce 560 while displaying the data sets zoomed to fit a 1600 × 1200 px viewport . The only time-consuming calculation is the construction of the scalar fields, which is currently performed by an unoptimized singlethreaded CPU implementation. For the largest data set D5 this takes roughly 1.75 seconds per time step on an Intel Core2 Duo with 3 GHz and 8 GB RAM. As this computation must only be done if the parameters like the influence radius r (cf. section 3.2.2) are changed, we can cache the scalar field and consider its calculation a pre-processing step. For future work, this computation could obviously be optimized e.g. using a GPU implementation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Previous Visualization Approaches</head><p>The domain scientists in the application area at hand traditionally used histograms and other simple visualizations to analyze the results of their simulation runs. Grasping the three-dimensional structure of a time-dependent data set with such tools is obviously a cognitively demanding task, wherefore glyph-based visualization techniques have become common. But even with the color of the glyphs highlighting their orientation as described in sec. 3.2.1, it is difficult to perceive patterns in the orientations of the dipole moments, even in a small neighborhood (cf. e.g. figs. 6 and 7). Thus, for analyzing processes like the propagation of a crack, a more global and less cluttered view on the data was required. A first approach to generate a visualization that takes local neighborhoods of atoms into account was averaging the dipole information, similar to the splatting kernel function we use. This average orientation vector A j can be computed for a voxel j as </p><formula>A j = ∑ i w i j p p p i ∑ i w i j p p p i , </formula><formula>(7) </formula><p>with p p p i being the vector of the dipole moment of atom i and w i j the same weighting factors as in sec. 3.2.2. If all dipole moments of the atoms in one neighborhood point into the same direction, A j will yield 1. Otherwise the value will rapidly decrease towards 0. However, simply averaging the dipole moments creates false impressions, as can be seen in fig. 8: strong correlated orientations (zoomed-in view) are not captured by averaged information (c) when the moments cancel each other out. Our approach of using FA is therefore better suited to visualize the electrostatic dipole moments than this previously used method. <ref type="figure" coords="6,196.41,206.15,3.10,7.37" target="#tab_1">1</ref>); Left: the direct glyph visualization is the only representation that captures the orientation of the individual particles, but in chaotic regions (a), e. g. right in front of the crack's tip, it is not clear if there is a correlated orientation (iso surface FA = 0.81). Center: the field of averaged orientation (cf. section 4.1) shows the high degree of correlated orientations at the surfaces to the vacuum at the crack (b), as well as the isotropic dipole moments at the cracks' tip. However, it fails to capture the apparent correlated orientation on the right side (c), as the moments are oriented opposed to each other (further zoomed-in view). Right: the field of FA (cf. section 3.2.2) clearly shows all three regions: the orientations at the surface (d) and in the area at the right (f) as well as the isotropic region at the crack's tip (e). In all images the same color map (cf. <ref type="figure" coords="6,107.75,262.93,16.39,7.37" target="#fig_1">fig. 5</ref>) is used. prising about 75,000 – 78,000 atoms taken every 100 fs real time from trajectories of MD simulations of crack propagation in α-alumina. An elliptical initial crack of 5 nm length in horizontal direction is inserted on one side of the samples by moving atoms in vertical direction. The opening of the crack is calculated with the Griffith criterion <ref type="bibr" coords="6,247.72,322.70,9.71,8.02" target="#b9">[9]</ref>: In front of the crack tip the sample is linearly strained until the elastic energy caused by the strain is equal to the Griffith energy, which is twice the surface energy of the crack plane. This criterion was fulfilled at about 4 % strain. The structures are then relaxed to obtain the displacement field of a stable crack. In the following, crystallographic planes and directions, e.g. the planes the crack is inserted in, are characterized by the Bravais Miller index (hkil)/[hkil] <ref type="bibr" coords="6,204.20,392.44,13.74,8.02" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. h, k and l are identical to the Miller index and i = −(h + k) is a redundant index. This characterization is due to the trigonal structure of the α-alumina unit cell. </p><formula>a) b) c) d) e) f) </formula></div>

As expected following recent electron microscopy investigations <ref type="bibr" coords="6,242.69,466.83,13.74,8.02" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, the crack inserted into the ( ¯ 2110) plane propagates in the same direction. Hocker et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,70.93,486.75,14.94,8.02" target="#b13">[13] </ref>already discussed a strong collective orientation of the dipole moments at the crack surface, which is clearly visible in the large and brightly colored arrow glyphs. The anisotropic orientation is more pronounced at the surfaces of the initial crack. In addition yellow and blue glyphs inside the bulk material also show strong collective orientations in areas which are still strained (cf. <ref type="figure" coords="6,195.09,536.57,17.19,8.02">fig. 2</ref> ). Previous visualizations based on averaged dipole moments have been unable to capture this orientation (cf. sec. 4.1), as the dipole moments nullify each other, which is remedied by the use of FA, as can be seen in <ref type="figure" coords="6,239.38,566.46,20.69,8.02" target="#fig_4">fig. 8.</ref>As the crack propagates, the disorder along the crack surfaces and some intact atomic chains across the crack reduce the alignment – an observation that agrees with previous simulations of alumina, where it was stated that such atomic chains have been observed in experiments as well <ref type="bibr" coords="6,52.39,616.27,13.74,8.02" target="#b39">[41]</ref>. The combination of all visualization techniques used as shown in <ref type="figure" coords="6,67.65,626.23,18.70,8.02">fig. 4</ref>reveals that the traditional glyph-based approach is required for these observations as FA as an overview-providing technique cannot convey the actual orientations of the dipoles. However, the FA-based brightness modulation highlights a collective orientation of the electric dipole moments in front of the crack, where the configuration is still strained (cf. <ref type="figure" coords="6,184.46,676.65,17.99,8.02">fig. 2</ref>). Contrariwise, in the unstrained regions below and above the crack surfaces the dipoles show no preferred alignment, but orientate isotropically, which results in dark, almost black glyphs. While these effects have been expected by the application scientists, they have not been observable in visualizations of MD simulations before. Another effect, which was also previously unobserved are vesicular disorder regions (cf. blue arrows <ref type="figure" coords="6,285.12,443.99,20.26,7.37">Fig. 9</ref> . Zoomed-in view of data set D5 depicting a symmetrical implanted crack with periodic boundary conditions: vesicular disorder regions (highlighted by blue arrows, iso surface FA = 0.81) propagate perpendicularly to the crack as emphasized by iso surfaces. in <ref type="figure" coords="6,295.06,490.76,22.64,8.02">fig. 11</ref>) with an averaged diameter of about 7 ˚ A, which propagate perpendicularly to the crack through the probe. After these vesicular disorder regions occur the dipoles orientate isotropically. <ref type="figure" coords="6,295.08,521.33,25.94,8.02">Fig. 10</ref>shows six additional snapshots taken out of data set D4 at intervals of 20 fs. In this visualization, the scalar field of FA reveals a stationary wave in the dipole field between the crack tip and the fixed boundary on the right. The disturbance coming from the crack tip is stabilized by the fixed boundaries on bottom and on top of the sample. This effect has not been observed before with any other visualization and will be object of further simulation studies. To rule out effects arising from the periodic boundary conditions in D4, which involve unnatural surfaces in some directions, we inserted a symmetrical crack in the middle of the sample and applied periodic boundaries in each direction (data set D5). As long as the two crack tips are far from each other, we observe the same results as with open boundary conditions (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,375.54,641.56,13.44,8.02" target="#b13">[13]</ref>). However, <ref type="figure" coords="6,435.27,641.56,18.52,8.02">fig. 9</ref> shows that the vesicular disorder regions, which propagate perpendicularly to the crack, can be seen more clearly when enclosed by the iso surface of FA = 0.81. </p></div>

The visualization of the field of FA provides a deeper insight into the influence of the redirected crack on the dipole orientations in the system: <ref type="figure" coords="7,31.50,172.53,23.65,7.37">Fig. 10</ref>. Snapshots taken out of data set D4 at intervals of 20 fs: the upper row shows the scalar field of FA, the lower row shows the classic glyph-based visualization. The upper images reveal a stationary wave in the dipole field between the crack tip and the fixed boundary on the right. The white-orange color of the large area in the first and last image show the positive wave peaks while yellow-orange in the two center images represent the negative wave peak. In the classical visualization in the lower row (iso surface with FA = 0.81), this wave cannot be seen. <ref type="figure" coords="7,31.50,401.81,22.54,7.37">Fig. 11</ref>. Crack in the ( ¯ 2110) plane; Iso surfaces of FA = 0.81 separate regions with highly correlated dipole orientations from regions of isotropic orientations (cf. <ref type="figure" coords="7,88.48,420.74,16.15,7.37">fig. 4</ref>). The blue arrows highlight the vesicular disorder regions. The glyphs for individual dipoles are filtered based on the average orientations field data to only show arrows at the crack and border regions. <ref type="figure" coords="7,31.50,470.47,26.27,8.02">Fig. 12</ref>depicts data set D6 – on the left side a snapshot at the very beginning of the simulation. Although the crack did not yet change its propagation direction, it already has an influence on the alignment of the surrounding dipole moments. This can e.g. be seen through the considerably different iso surface shapes (FA = 0.81) above and below the crack. Above the crack one can observe a large region of correlated orientation, whereas below only a very small similar area exists. The right side of <ref type="figure" coords="7,76.72,540.21,22.79,8.02">fig. 12</ref>shows the same simulation run after 2.4 ps. At this point, the crack has changed its propagation direction and the same vesicular disorder region moving away perpendicularly from the crack can be seen (blue arrow) like in the other data sets. Its averaged diameter , however, is 42Å42˚42Å, which is six times larger than in the scenario in section 4.3.1. The influence of the crack on the dipole realignment is subject of current research in the application domain. Finally, visualizing FA reveals a circular wave of dipole disorder coming from the crack tip (see <ref type="figure" coords="7,147.76,620.62,21.76,8.02" target="#fig_0">fig. 13</ref>). To our knowledge, this is a first-time observation in MD simulations. The wavelength λ of this circular wave is about 7.4 ˚ A and further simulations with larger samples should enable a deeper analysis of the properties of such dipole disorder waves. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We have presented a combination of established and new visualization techniques for analyzing electrostatic dipoles in MD simulations of alumina. First, we have directly shown the atom positions and dipole orientations as arrow glyphs – a technique the domain scientists are familiar with. Second, we have computed and displayed a scalar field <ref type="figure" coords="7,294.12,308.44,23.10,7.37">Fig. 12</ref>. Crack in the (0001) plane, left: snapshot at the very beginning of simulation taken out of D6. A higher degree of disordered dipole orientations above the inserted crack than below is visible through the iso surface (FA = 0.81). Right: the same simulation after 2.4 ps and after changed crack propagation direction; a vesicular disorder region propagates approximately perpendicular to the crack (blue arrow). which represents the correlation of the dipole moments in a confined area using FA. Third, we have employed iso surfaces in the beforementioned scalar field to accentuate the borders between regions of different correlated dipole alignments, which is particularly useful for animations of trajectories. Physicists used the visualization to investigate the propagation of cracks in α-alumina in their MD simulations. FA, which we borrowed from the area of DTI, proved to be specifically valuable for this application . It improves the display of previous analytical findings like the strong collective orientation of the dipole moments along the crack surface <ref type="bibr" coords="7,322.61,487.18,13.74,8.02" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. This effect can be seen in the FA field itself, as well as in the traditional glyph-based visualizations, which also greatly benefit from brightness modulation and filtering based on FA. Only the combination of all three visualizations allows for efficient and effective observation of the data, providing overview (through FA and iso surfaces) as well as detail information (through the glyphs). In case of the (0001) plane, the FA field also shows a very different orientation behavior of the oxygen atoms above and below the crack from the very beginning of the simulation run. More importantly, the visualization revealed a circular wave of dipole disorder originating from the crack tip, which has never been observed before in MD simulations. Furthermore , it shows vesicular disorder regions caused by the crack for the first time. While the physicists are pleased to see the visualization confirm effects that have been expected, but not yet observed in MD simulations, the visual analysis of the simulation results more importantly shows directions for future research. This includes new simulation runs to investigate size and number of the vesicular disorder regions as well as the waves of disorder coming from the crack tip using larger simulation domains. It is well-known by domain scientists that cracks have strong influence on the lattice dynamics of a crystalline system, which results in phonons propagating away from the crack tip. With the results of the present contribution it can now be investigated whether there is a correlation between the propagation of dipole waves and phonons or rather how strong it is. Such an analysis, however, will also require a further-refined visualization. <ref type="figure" coords="8,22.50,220.67,23.23,7.37" target="#fig_0">Fig. 13</ref>.

			<note place="foot">Fig. 4. A combined visualization using all of our visual metaphors. FA shows the strain in the right area and at the border regions as well as at the surface of the initially inserted crack (left side). The iso surface (FA = 0.81) further emphasizes these regions and especially helps creating context between the atoms&apos; glyphs and the FA scalar field representation . The glyphs, however, are also necessary as the crack (center of the image) is hardly perceivable in the FA field, due to the atom chains mentioned in section 4.3.1. The combination of all three visualizations allows for efficient and effective observation of the data, providing overview (through FA and iso surfaces) as well as detail information (through the glyphs). 3.2 Visualization Point-based glyph representations are nowadays established as a stateof-the-art visualization paradigm for MD data sets, except for special applications from some research fields for which abstract visual metaphors have been derived from the particle data sets, e.g. cartoon or surface representations for proteins in bio-chemistry. For atoms without specifically oriented attributes, spheres are sufficient visualization primitives. However, for the work at hand the orientation of the dipole moments of oxygen atoms needs to be shown and emphasized to aid the analysis of the data. Additionally, the information of each atom has to be related to its surrounding atoms, as the dipole moment is induced by neighboring charges and dipole moments. We therefore use three visual metaphors to represent the data. First, we use arrow glyphs to depict the placement and orientation of the oxygen atoms, while optionally showing non-polar atoms as simple spheres (cf. fig. 3) – an established visualization that domain experts are familiar with. The orientation is furthermore mapped to the color of the glyhps (cf. sec. 3.2.1), which allows for visually identifying large areas of strongly correlated orientations. Second, we derive a scalar field of FA from the orientation of the atoms that quantitatively captures the correlation in a confined area. Slices of this scalar field can be added to the visualization for an extremely easy identification of areas of very high and very low correlation in the orientation of the dipoles (cf. fig. 4). Third, iso surfaces of the FA scalar field are applied to enclose these regions of strongly correlated orientations, and facilitate tracking changes in size and position of correlated areas over time (cf. fig. 11). The visualization at hand is implemented using an existing visualization system developed at our research group, which focuses on the display of particle data sets, i.e. MegaMol [26]. The system already provides us with modules for ray casting spheres and arrows on the GPU. For this application, we added four new modules: the first one is for extracting the scalar field from the raw simulation data. Its function is described in section 3.2.2. A second one is used to cache the results of the former. The third one renders the scalar field, and the last one is for modulating the color of the glyphs and filtering the glyphs based on the value of a scalar field, which allows for showing the FA values on the glyphs themselves.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="0"> ps (upper left), 5 ps (upper right) and 10 ps (center). Below the time series, the snap shot after 10 ps is also shown but all glyphs with FA values below 0.6 are filtered. The bottom-most image is again the same time step shown as FA field representation. Only in some areas exhibit correlated orientations, i.e. at the occurring cracks (zoomed-in view on the right). 4.2 Simulation Validation The data sets D1 and D2 are the results of a 10 ps/4 ps MD simulation of liquid silica at 3,000 K. While the glyph representation in fig. 6 (left) reveals that there are no correlated orientations of the eletrostatic dipole moments, the FA display on the right uncovers the dynamics of the equilibrium: Due to the Brownian, thermal motion of the oxygen ions, the direction of each dipole moment changes continuously, which yields small, unstable areas of local polarization. Both effects, the total dipole moment of the sample being negligible and the continuos fluctuations, are expected for this simulation setup and serve as validation of the applied simulation techniques [4, 13]. Data set D3 is the 10 ps trajectory of periclase (crystalline magnesia with NaCl-structure). A linear strain is simulated at 300 K until material failure. Figure 7 (top) shows that there is no preferred orientation of the electrostatic dipole moments in the original material. The same is observed when strain is applied and the probe is stretched in the direction of this strain. This behavior is in agreement with theory, because the influence of strain on the electrostatic properties (piezoelectricity ) requires an inversion symmetry breaking. This breaking can be introduced by inserting a crack in the system (cf. sec. 4.3). In data set D3 orientation effects caused by surfaces at breaking points can be observed by bright arrows showing corresponding high values of FA. As expected, these effects occur only at the crack surfaces. 4.3 Crack Propagation Application Scenario The actual application scenario for this work is the propagation of cracks in crystalline materials and their influence on the electrostatic properties of the samples. The data sets D4 – D6 are snapshots</note>
