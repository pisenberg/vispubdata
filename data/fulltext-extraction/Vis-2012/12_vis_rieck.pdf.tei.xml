				<p>Fig. 1. Analysis of a cuneiform tablet found in the Middle East. The high-resolution surface scan of the clay tablet with Assyrian writing (center) can be described by 16-dimensional Multiscale Integral Invariant Volume Descriptors. The persistence rings (left) reveal characteristic patterns in the high-dimensional space that aid in the automatic segmentation of characters (right). Abstract—The extraction of significant structures in arbitrary high-dimensional data sets is a challenging task. Moreover, classifying data points as noise in order to reduce a data set bears special relevance for many application domains. Standard methods such as clustering serve to reduce problem complexity by providing the user with classes of similar entities. However, they usually do not highlight relations between different entities and require a stopping criterion, e.g. the number of clusters to be detected. In this paper, we present a visualization pipeline based on recent advancements in algebraic topology. More precisely, we employ methods from persistent homology that enable topological data analysis on high-dimensional data sets. Our pipeline inherently copes with noisy data and data sets of arbitrary dimensions. It extracts central structures of a data set in a hierarchical manner by using a persistence-based filtering algorithm that is theoretically well-founded. We furthermore introduce persistence rings, a novel visualization technique for a class of topological features—the persistence intervals—of large data sets. Persistence rings provide a unique topological signature of a data set, which helps in recognizing similarities. In addition, we provide interactive visualization techniques that assist the user in evaluating the parameter space of our method in order to extract relevant structures. We describe and evaluate our analysis pipeline by means of two very distinct classes of data sets: First, a class of synthetic data sets containing topological objects is employed to highlight the interaction capabilities of our method. Second, in order to affirm the utility of our technique, we analyse a class of high-dimensional real-world data sets arising from current research in cultural heritage.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In an age of ever-increasing information density, scientists in many domains generate large amounts of high-dimensional data during their experiments. From a researcher's perspective, the amount and dimensionality of experimental data are both " boon and bane " : On the one hand, large data sets with many variables contain more information that might be relevant during analysis and aid in detecting correlations between objects. On the other hand, finding relevant structures in high-dimensional data sets (regardless of their size) is non-trivial. Projection techniques, while worthwhile, may occlude salient structures , thereby creating a wholly different appearance of a data set. Alternatively, clustering algorithms can be used for complexity reduc- @BULLET <ref type="bibr" coords="1,43.70,657.36,126.48,7.11">Bastian Rieck, Hubert Mara, and Heike </ref>tion. Briefly put, the idea of these algorithms <ref type="bibr" coords="1,460.25,519.82,14.94,8.12" target="#b18">[19] </ref>is to group similar objects, thus supporting a researcher in finding hitherto hidden structures in data sets. However, clustering does not necessarily emphasize any structures in high-dimensional data sets—it yields a set of similar objects, leaving much information in the input data unused. The inclusion of topological information such as the Betti numbers, on the other hand, helps uncover differences and similarities between clusters . To this end, we exploit recent advantages in algebraic topology. In short, algebraic topology does not rely on the actual coordinates of data points (as opposed to geometrically-motivated methods). Instead , distances (i.e. relations) between the points are considered important . Hence, these methods are ideally suited for analysing highdimensional , unstructured data sets. The long-standing conversion problem of unstructured data sets into the realm of algebraic topology was recently addressed by the development of persistent homology. Recognizing the inherent multiscale topology of such data, persistent homology is also somewhat noise-resistant. </p><p>In this paper, we introduce a visualization pipeline that couples a recent persistence-based clustering scheme <ref type="bibr" coords="1,451.32,706.44,10.45,8.12" target="#b4">[5] </ref>with the calculation of topological signatures for clusters. Our visualization pipeline works on data sets of arbitrarily high dimensions and helps uncover hidden relationships between clusters. Our main contributions are: @BULLET Extending persistent homology analysis to work on large-scale, high-dimensional real-world data sets. @BULLET Introduction of persistence rings, a novel visualization technique for topological features of high-dimensional data sets, providing an abstract and concise characterization of their structures. @BULLET Description of an analysis workflow (based on persistent homology ) that is suitable for the interactive exploration of highdimensional data sets. @BULLET Application of our methods to a high-dimensional data set from cultural heritage results in the discovery of hitherto unknown structures. We use these structures to provide the automatic extraction of cuneiform characters from digitized cuneiform tablets. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p> For the exploration of multivariate data sets, common algorithms either try to find relevant dimensions in the data or project all dimensions to 2D or 3D. Projection pursuit <ref type="bibr" coords="2,134.81,235.52,14.94,8.12" target="#b17">[18] </ref>and Isomap <ref type="bibr" coords="2,200.37,235.52,3.55,8.12">[</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,253.39,305.40,10.45,8.12" target="#b4">[5] </ref>is related to density-based clustering methods such as DBSCAN <ref type="bibr" coords="2,242.79,315.36,14.94,8.12" target="#b12">[13] </ref>and DENCLUE <ref type="bibr" coords="2,62.77,325.32,13.74,8.12" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. However, both methods use a number of parameters that require fine-tuning and their cluster detection is not based on the topology of a data set. Another approach towards the exploration of multivariate data exploits the topological structure of data sets, thereby obtaining qualitative geometrical information. Furthermore, as Carlsson <ref type="bibr" coords="2,228.34,375.27,10.45,8.12" target="#b0">[1] </ref>remarks, topological methods are less sensitive to the choice of metrics and depend on intrinsic geometric properties of data sets. Due to their advantages , topological methods have seen widespread use in recent years: Gyulassy et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,77.67,415.12,14.94,8.12" target="#b14">[15] </ref>use topologically-motivated extraction of features from 3D scalar fields while also performing simplification. Weber et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,32.97,435.05,14.94,8.12" target="#b32">[34] </ref> visualize the topology of scalar functions as a terrain while preserving critical points. Building on this, Oesterling et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,224.15,445.01,14.94,8.12" target="#b25">[26] </ref>visualize generic point clouds. Singh et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,147.09,454.97,14.94,8.12" target="#b29">[30] </ref>presented Mapper, a method for extracting simplified representations of high-dimensional data sets using simplicial complexes and clustering algorithms. Its output is consistent with the Isomap algorithm. The generalized contour tree of Carr et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,73.47,494.82,10.45,8.12" target="#b2">[3] </ref>is commonly used for the analysis of scalar fields. Several extensions help explore multivariate data sets: Pascucci and Cole-McLaughlin <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.78,514.75,14.94,8.12" target="#b26">[27] </ref>augment contour trees with Betti numbers of isocontours, while Weber et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,138.99,524.71,14.94,8.12" target="#b33">[35] </ref>use contour trees to control and improve volume rendering. In order to provide multi-resolution analysis of larger data sets, Pascucci et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,168.00,544.64,14.94,8.12" target="#b27">[28] </ref> present a topologicallymotivated simplification of the contour tree. Recently, the pool of topological methods has been expanded by persistent homology, a multiscale method for dealing with unstructured high-dimensional data sets containing noise. As a tool, persistent homology has already been used for the analysis of special data sets: Carlsson et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,75.22,604.55,10.45,8.12" target="#b1">[2] </ref>used persistent homology to investigate the space of natural images, thereby identifying certain submanifolds in the data. Singh et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,66.71,624.48,14.94,8.12" target="#b30">[31] </ref> applied persistent homology to analyse the topological structure of neural activity of the primary visual cortex. Their experiments confirm that spontaneous activity is statistically different from noise. de Silva and Ghrist <ref type="bibr" coords="2,145.26,654.36,9.71,8.12" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,158.23,654.36,7.47,8.12" target="#b8"> 9] </ref>used persistent homology to detect holes in sensor network coverage. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND</head><p>In the following, we will expand on the concepts that are relevant for understanding both the clustering algorithm and the calculation of topological signatures. We will not be able to cover every topic in detail but strive to give a short and interesting overview of the matter. For brevity, some concepts will only be defined very loosely. The reader is <ref type="figure" coords="2,301.91,138.06,3.32,7.64">2</ref>. Non-zero Betti numbers for idealized (i.e. perfectly sampled) topological objects. For the torus, we also show the two generators of the first homology group. We have b 2 = 1 because the torus encloses a void, i.e. the space inside its " tube " . Comparing the nested circles with the torus highlights the importance of higher-dimensional homology groups: Only when calculating 2-dimensional homology groups can we distinguish the nested circles from the torus by purely topological means. <ref type="figure" coords="2,285.12,308.68,18.67,7.64">Fig. 3</ref>. A simplicial complex containing simplices of dimensions 0–3, i.e. vertices, edges, triangles, and a tetrahedron. Note that only the filled faces in the figure are considered simplices. For real data sets, we obtain the Vietoris-Rips complex V ε from a Rips graph R ε —see Sec. 3.2. referred to Hatcher <ref type="bibr" coords="2,357.03,364.82,14.94,8.12" target="#b15">[16] </ref>and Munkres <ref type="bibr" coords="2,424.99,364.82,14.94,8.12" target="#b24">[25] </ref>for a general introduction to algebraic topology. Zomorodian <ref type="bibr" coords="2,411.99,374.78,14.94,8.12" target="#b35">[37] </ref>and Edelsbrunner <ref type="bibr" coords="2,494.10,374.78,13.74,8.12" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, on the other hand, provide excellent introductions to persistent homology and topological data analysis. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Algebraic topology</head><p>The core concept of algebraic topology is a topological space. We may think of this as a set of data points from R m , along with some notion of connectivity, i.e. we require that each point " knows " its neighbours. It is the task of a topologist to obtain invariants of a topological space, i.e. criteria that help distinguish different topological spaces from each other. The most common invariant is given by simplicial homology. Put somewhat simplified, homology assigns a topological space a set of groups, denoted by H i , where i = 0, 1, . . . , m − 1. Each generator (in the group-theoretic sense) of a homology group of dimension n then describes an n-dimensional " hole " in the data set. Thus, the topological features detected by simplicial homology correspond to ndimensional " holes " , e.g. connected components (dimension 0), tunnels (dimension 1), and voids (dimension 2). The number of " holes " in dimension n is also known as the nth Betti number b n of the data set. A sphere in R 3 , for example, has b 0 = 1 (because a sphere has a single connected component), b 1 = 0 (because the surface of a sphere does not have any holes), and b 2 = 1 (because the sphere encloses a void). In contrast to this, a " filled " sphere, i.e. a ball, in R 3 has b 2 = 0 because it does not enclose a void. <ref type="figure" coords="2,422.15,606.28,22.11,8.12">Fig. 2</ref>shows more topological objects and their corresponding Betti numbers. In Sec. 6.1, we will recover their topological properties from non-idealized, noisy samples as well. Since homology is an invariant, the homology groups of two homeomorphic spaces coincide (two spaces are said to be homeomorphic if they can be transformed into each other by " stretching " and " bending " ; a classical example is the homeomorphism between a doughnut and a coffee mug—see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,370.74,686.25,13.74,8.12" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, p. 5, for an example). Equal homology groups, however, do not imply that two spaces are homeomorphic. There are several (mostly equivalent) notions of defining homology groups. From the perspective of computer science, simplicial homology is the most appealing one because it can be calculated effectively—see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,380.31,736.33,62.75,8.12">[25, pp. 56–61] </ref>for the standard algo-rithm. For these calculations, the topological space needs to be given as a simplicial complex, i.e. a space constructed from vertices (0-dimensional simplices), edges (1-dimensional simplices), triangular faces (2-dimensional simplices), and their corresponding ndimensional generalizations—see <ref type="figure" coords="3,155.63,93.14,21.48,8.12">Fig. 3</ref> for an example. For simplicial homology, the generators of the homology groups are represented as formal sums of simplices, the simplicial chains. Our topological signature calculation algorithm uses these chains in order to highlight the detected features of a data set. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Persistent homology</head><p> Since real-world data sets are not commonly endowed with a topological structure, it needs to be obtained by some means. The standard construction for this is to calculate a Rips graph R ε (also known as neighbourhood graph) for the data set. R ε is then expanded into a simplicial complex, yielding the Vietoris-Rips complex V ε <ref type="bibr" coords="3,244.06,209.58,13.74,8.12">[32]</ref>. Note that V ε is built from the input data set and each of its simplices is a subset of the data. Thus, if given a 1-simplex (u, v) of V ε , for example, it is justified to say that data point u and v create the simplex. Usually, the Rips graph is defined as follows: Given a set of n data points from R m , the Rips graph R ε is a graph whose vertices are given as V = {0, . . . , n − 1} and whose edges are given as E = {(i, j)| d(i, j) ≤ ε}, where d refers to a distance function such as the Euclidean metric. The problem of R ε is its distance parameter ε: Different values will yield different Rips graphs, which in turn will associate different homology groups to the data set. Recognizing that there is no single " correct " parameter value for real-world data sets, persistent homology now calculates homology groups for a range of values for ε. To this end, the simplices of the Vietoris-Rips complex are partitioned into positive and negative simplices—see the seminal paper of Edelsbrunner et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,84.30,370.83,14.94,8.12" target="#b11">[12] </ref> for details on this calculation. Briefly put, positive simplices create a topological feature—i.e. a " hole " —while negative simplices destroy one. By assigning each simplex a weight (for example the value of ε for which the simplex " appears " in the simplicial complex), topological features can be assigned a persistence value. For a feature created by a k-dimensional simplex σ , this value is given as the difference between the weight of the negative (k + 1)- dimensional simplex τ destroying it and the weight of σ , its creator. If a feature never gets destroyed, it is assigned an infinite persistence. For each dimension k, the persistence values are combined into persistence intervals of the form <ref type="bibr" coords="3,106.08,469.90,17.41,8.97">[a, b] </ref>with a ∈ R and b ∈ R∪{∞}. Informally put, a is the " creation time " of a topological feature, while b is the time of its " destruction " . The persistence or prominence of a persistence interval is given as b − a ∈ R ∪ {∞}. Intuitively, high persistence indicates relevant features in the data set, while low persistence indicates topological noise. Thus, persistent homology defines a multiscale homology theory for unstructured data sets (usually given as point clouds) by assigning them a set of persistence intervals. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Filtrations</head><p>At the heart of all persistent homology calculations lies the concept of a filtration. A filtration of a given simplicial complex is a sequence of valid subcomplexes. We may think of this as a simplicial complex that is built by incrementally adding new simplices. By keeping track in which simplicial complex a given simplex appears first, a filtration naturally imposes a partial order on the set of simplices. This partial order can be extended to a total order by sorting conflicting simplices by dimension and, in case of ties, lexicographically. By varying the filtration of a simplicial complex, we can influence the type and number of topological features that are detected. This is done by assigning low-dimensional simplices (usually, either 0-simplices or 1-simplices) a weight w that is calculated by some means (such as the Euclidean distance between two 1-simplices). The weight of higher-dimensional simplices is then calculated as the maximum of the weight of the lowerdimensional simplices it comprises. Persistent homology calculations then use these weights as the respective creation and destruction times for features. For this paper, we require two filtrations. </p><p>Upper star filtration The persistence-based clustering scheme (see Sec. 3.4 for details) uses the upper star filtration, which assigns each 0-simplex v a density value f (v), and each edge (u, v) the value max ( f (u), f (v)). Simplices are now sorted by decreasing function value and increasing dimension. Zomorodian <ref type="bibr" coords="3,529.56,93.15,14.94,8.12" target="#b35">[37] </ref>showed that the upper star filtration corresponds to exploring the superlevel sets of the weight function, i.e. sets of the form f −1 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,328.60,122.46,21.24,8.99">[α, ∞] </ref>for some value α ∈ R. Distance filtration We use the distance filtration for the calculation of topological signatures. This filtration assigns 0-simplices a weight of 0, while a 1-simplex (u, v) is assigned the value d(u, v), i.e. the Euclidean distance between data points u and v. This filtration is more geometrically-inclined and simplifies the detection of geometrical features in a data set—the meaning of this will become clear when analysing the example data sets. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Persistence-based clustering</head><p>The persistence-based clustering scheme of Chazal et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,507.92,230.06,10.45,8.12" target="#b4">[5] </ref>uses a density estimator to obtain a density value f (p) for each data point p. Thus, their algorithm fits into the class of density-based clustering schemes: Given a density function f , the assumption is that the input data are samples drawn from f —see Kotsiantis and Pintelas <ref type="bibr" coords="3,529.56,269.91,14.94,8.12" target="#b18">[19] </ref>for more information. Hence, in order to understand the structure of the data set, the scheme of Chazal et al. analyses the topology of f by associating clusters with the regions of attraction of the local maxima. Since a density function is usually not directly available, it needs to be estimated before initializing the clustering scheme. Our method estimates the density using the distance to a measure method introduced by Chazal et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,397.84,339.65,9.52,8.12" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Requiring only a distance function d( · , · ), this density estimator is well-suited for the density estimation of point clouds. For a query point p in the data set, we have </p><formula>f (p) = −1/k ∑ k i=1 d 2 (p, n i )</formula><p>, where n i refers to the ith neighbour of the query point p and k is the number of neighbouring points that are used for the density estimation. Note that the minus sign is required to ensure that larger function values correspond to higher densities. Taking the input points as vertices of a Rips graph R ε , each vertex p is then assigned its density value f (p). Chazal et al. consider R ε to be a 1-dimensional simplicial complex and sort it by an upperstar filtration. Their calculation of persistent homology now involves looking at the superlevel sets of f , i.e. sets of the form f −1 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,510.19,455.45,21.24,8.98">[α, ∞] </ref>for a density value α ∈ R. From Morse theory, we know that a new component appears in the superlevel set of f whenever a local maximum v is reached. Persistent homology now prescribes that v creates a new connected component. The component created by v is destroyed when it gets connected to another component that has been created by an even larger density value. This can only happen at data points that are not a local maximum. Letting α c be the density value upon creation of the component and α d the density value upon destruction, we assign a persistence interval of </p><formula>[α c , α d ]</formula><p>. Following Chazal et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,502.81,545.68,9.52,8.12" target="#b4">[5]</ref> , we display the intervals in a persistence diagram—see Sec. 4.1 for their definition . Note that, by construction, each persistence interval belongs to the 0-dimensional homology group. Thus, it describes a connected component in the data set, and the number of intervals with a large persistence is taken as an approximation to the number of clusters in the data set. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Topological signatures</head><p>Having extracted structures from the data set using the persistence clustering algorithm that is the core of our scheme, we partition the data set according to its persistent homology in dimension 0. This operation yields several small sets, whose total number depends on the current parameters of the algorithm. We now expand each of this smaller sets into its corresponding Vietoris-Rips complex, using the fast expansion algorithm described by Zomorodian <ref type="bibr" coords="3,479.19,696.48,13.74,8.12" target="#b36">[38]</ref> . We purposefully ignore the density estimates for this expansion. Instead, we select a distance-based filtration for the complex. More precisely, this filtration will assign each 0-simplex a weight of zero, while each 1- simplex (u, v) is assigned the Euclidean distance d(u, v) between u <ref type="figure" coords="4,22.50,155.12,19.18,7.64">Fig. 4</ref> . Persistence diagram (left, showing H 0 ) and 3D view of the synthetic data set (right). The object colours on the right indicate the cluster a data point belongs to. Our algorithm recovers the three distinct objects correctly. We created the objects at different scales in order to prove that our persistence visualizations handle this correctly. For the persistence diagram (left), we colour-coded points by their relative persistence values, using a continuous diverging colour map suggested by Moreland <ref type="bibr" coords="4,57.72,221.37,12.41,7.64" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Note that the points in the upper right corner have a very high multiplicity but as their persistence values are roughly equal, they become occluded. and v. We selected this filtration because it represents multi-scale features better—features at smaller scales, for example, may not conform to the surrounding density, which would make them harder to detect. For each expanded complex, we now apply the persistent homology calculation algorithm described by Zomorodian and Carlsson <ref type="bibr" coords="4,245.14,308.17,13.74,8.12" target="#b37">[39]</ref>. In addition to the calculation of the persistence intervals as outlined in Section 3.2, this algorithm has been extended to calculate the generators of the detected features. Each generator corresponds to a simplicial chain that creates a certain topological feature in the data set—we show examples for this in Sec. 6.1. As a result, we obtain a set of topological signatures depicting the topology of each structure that was detected by the persistence clustering algorithm. The use of topological signatures depends on the selected data set. At a coarse level, even without the calculation of homology generators , they help in similarity detection. Similar topological signatures indicate similarities in the detected structures. At a fine level, by using the homology generators, the signatures may uncover hidden or nested structures in the detected clusters. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">PERSISTENCE VISUALIZATIONS</head><p>Persistent homology calculations yield a set of persistence intervals for each dimension. Currently, there are two common methods for visualizing these intervals: Drawing them as intervals in the plane, which is done by persistence barcodes <ref type="bibr" coords="4,138.52,503.00,13.74,8.12" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, or drawing them as points in the plane, which is done by persistence diagrams <ref type="bibr" coords="4,190.25,512.96,9.52,8.12" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In this section, we show both visualizations and describe their drawbacks. In addition, we motivate our persistence rings visualization, which uses a radial visualization of persistence intervals, thereby combining the advantages of persistence diagrams and barcodes. In the following, we assume that we have a set I k of persistence intervals for each dimension k of the data set. Intervals from I k describe generators from the kth persistent homology group, and we will hence say that the corresponding visualization shows H k (while it actually shows the generators of H k ). </p></div>

Intervals with b = ∞ are usually placed slightly outside the diagram or on its (upper or lower) border. Note that, depending on the filtration, values are either situated all above the diagonal (e.g. for the distance-based filtration) or below the diagonal (e.g. for the upper-star filtration used for persistence clustering). Points with a close distance to the diagonal indicate features that have a rather brief existence. Consequently, a dense area of points around the diagonal indicates topological noise. In total, the persistence diagram stresses the lifespan, i.e. the persistence of topological features, highlighting those that do not exist for very long. <ref type="figure" coords="4,300.24,147.01,3.32,7.64">5</ref>. H 1 of the second cluster (a torus) of the synthetic data set, shown as a barcode (which we rotated for layout reasons). Even for an object as topologically simple as a torus, the amount of persistence intervals is substantial. See Sec. 6.1 for a detailed discussion of the data set. </p><p> The drawback of this visualization is that users expect the dense areas around the diagonal to represent significant structures in the data set—instead, the converse is true. We solve this by colouring each point in the diagram based on its (relative) persistence value. Relevant points, i.e. points with a large persistence, are highlighted in red by this colour map. A further problem of the diagram is the occlusion of features with (almost) equal values. Users cannot easily determine how many features are represented by a point in the diagram. For qualitative queries, e.g. for comparing which point represents more features in the diagram, colour-coding could be used. However, this still makes it harder for users to grasp how many features are present. Despite all this, the persistence diagram has its merits because it greatly simplifies highlighting all features whose lifespan is bounded by some upper value. Thus, the persistence diagram is a good choice for displaying the results of the clustering algorithm. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Persistence barcodes</head><p>For each <ref type="bibr" coords="4,318.17,378.96,17.41,8.97">[a, b] </ref> ∈ I k , we obtain a persistence barcode by drawing a horizontal line or bar from a to position b. The resulting bars are then placed on top of each other—see <ref type="figure" coords="4,410.17,399.44,21.80,8.12">Fig. 5</ref> for an example. Again, intervals with b = ∞ are handled by extending their lines beyond the borders of the barcode. Thus, barcodes represent persistence intervals as bars of different lengths, thereby highlighting both the lifespans of attributes as well as their creation times. The disadvantage of barcodes is their increase in height for larger data sets—which is why we will not be using them for the analysis of our data sets in Sec. 6. Since even a very small interval occupies some vertical space, users quickly lose their overview over larger data sets. For example, users cannot simply estimate the number of features present at a given " time " . A further problem of barcodes is that very small intervals may not be represented adequately—they may simply be lost in the clutter of surrounding intervals. On the other hand, since each feature is represented by a single bar, the barcode does not suffer from any occlusion problems. Using zooming and filtering of intervals, interactive barcodes may somewhat remedy the shortcomings . However, barcodes cannot easily provide users with a sufficient overview of the data set. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Persistence rings</head><p> Motivated by requiring a visualization that is compact while still providing a good overview of the data set, we introduce persistence rings. This visualization displays persistence intervals radially. More precisely , we assign <ref type="bibr" coords="4,349.12,635.29,17.41,8.97">[a, b] </ref>∈ I k an annular sector from radius a to radius b. If b = ∞, we use a radius that is larger than the radii used for the finite intervals. Consequently, we still have two degrees of freedom for drawing the annular sectors, namely its opening angle θ (which determines the size of the sector) and its angular offset φ (which determines the radial position of the sector). Depending on the desired view on the data set, different ways of selecting these angles can be established. Ideally, we would like the angles to reflect the relevance of a given feature. Foremost, however, we require that all annular sectors are placed without any overlaps. Satisfying both constraints is not easily possible because the problem is inherently a global optimization problem—local optimization of angles cannot guarantee that there are no overlaps. In addition, the intersections between different intervals are intransitive, making it harder to check whether an interval can be placed correctly. During the implementation of the persistence rings, we experimented with different approaches. Global optimization of both angles (using a simple function that relates the area of a segment to its persistence) proved to be very costly due to missing gradients. Furthermore, the layout was not aesthetically pleasing and contained some overlaps, thereby not alleviating the occlusion problem. Our current implementation thus uses a simple heuristic to ensure that there are no overlaps and that the size of each segment and its persistence are (roughly) correlated—see Alg. 1 for details. However, the heuristic cannot guarantee this correlation: Segments with few neighbours may be assigned a large θ even though their persistence is small.

The colours of the annular sectors can also be used for other purposes: For the calculation of topological signatures, we assign colours based on the length of the simplicial chain of a persistence interval. This colour assignment highlights topological features that occur at different scales, regardless of their actual persistence values—see our analysis in Sec. 6.1 for details. <ref type="figure" coords="5,31.50,576.93,21.56,8.12">Fig. 6</ref> contains different persistence visualizations for a noisy example data set. The data set (<ref type="figure" coords="5,132.64,586.89,24.48,8.12">Fig. 6a</ref>) contains two nested circles with different sizes that have been sampled unevenly with approximately 150 points per circle. Below the data set, the corresponding barcode for H 1 , i.e. the first homology group of the data set, is shown. Here, the barcode contains little noise and indicates that there are two persistent generators, described by the first bar (corresponding to the circle denoted by the number 2) and the third bar (corresponding to the circle denoted by the number 1). Two other generators with a smaller lifetime also appear, but are destroyed later on. These correspond to smaller degenerate circles caused by the additional noise in the data set. The persistence diagram (<ref type="figure" coords="5,141.59,686.52,24.27,8.12">Fig. 6b</ref>) showing the same information contains a lot of topological noise, which results in many points clustered around the diagonal. Note that since we used a distance filtration to calculate the persistence diagram, all points are situated above the diagonal. The persistence ring (<ref type="figure" coords="5,152.04,726.37,24.67,8.12">Fig. 6c</ref>) clearly shows that the first persistent generator (the larger of the two outer " slices " of the rings) 1 2 (c) <ref type="figure" coords="5,294.12,154.95,19.80,7.64">Fig. 6</ref>.

This indicates that the scale of the features described by the generators varies—we can see that there is a size difference between both circles. In essence, the persistence diagram shows (<ref type="figure" coords="5,353.98,260.50,24.14,8.12">Fig. 6b</ref>) the same information. However, the scale of the features is not immediately obvious to users. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">WORKFLOW</head><p> In short, our persistence-based visualization and analysis pipeline consists of the following steps: (i) We cluster input point clouds of arbitrary dimensions using the algorithm described in Sec. 3.4. (ii) The user is presented the clustering results via projections of the original data. (iii) Additional persistence visualizations depict central topological features of the data set. (iv) The different visualizations are interactive and coupled to enable a " brushing and linking " -like data exploration. More precisely, a typical analysis session results in the following steps: 1. Obtain information about the (potential) number of connected components in the data set by using dendrograms created with singlelinkage hierarchical clustering <ref type="bibr" coords="5,409.53,419.57,9.52,8.12" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Use this information to select a distance threshold ε for the persistence clustering algorithm. Note that without the dendrogram information, this parameter would be very volatile: A wrong value for ε will result in oversampling the input data—in the worst case, if ε is set to the maximum distance of two data points, the clustering scheme will always detect a single large cluster. 2. Set parameter k, which represents the number of neighbours used for the density estimator. Usually, our default value of 15 yields satisfactory results. The user may verify the choice for k through a point cloud or a histogram of the density values. Values for k that result in little variation should be avoided. If k is set too high, there will be no spread in densities any more. If k is set too low, too many points of maximum density will be found by the clustering algorithm. However, we did not experience any significant changes in the clustering quality when modifying k. Thus, as long as care is taken that there is some variation of densities, the actual parameter value is not relevant. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Use information</head><p> from the previous steps to apply the persistence clustering algorithm. This yields a (coarse) segmentation of the point cloud, resembling a density-based clustering. We provide a lowdimensional projection of the input point cloud, making it possible for the user to fine-tune parameters of the clustering scheme—although our software contains sensible default values for each parameter, they might not be applicable to any situation. Furthermore, we augment the projection using colours based on density values or cluster associations . If preferred by the user, the data view may also use projection techniques such as multidimensional scaling or parallel coordinates. 4. The user may now choose to either explore the segmented data set (using topological signatures) or refine the segmentation (by changing the parameters of the clustering algorithm). The topological sig-natures as described in Sec. 3.5 uncover similarities of the detected clusters. 5. Having obtained information using the topological signatures, the user may choose to perform further topological analysis on either the whole point cloud or parts of it. Due to the fast runtime of the persistence clustering algorithm for moderately sized data sets, this allows an almost real-time exploration of multivariate data sets. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">RESULTS</head><p>In the following, we present the results of applying our visualization pipeline to two classes of data sets. We first analyse a synthetic data set containing a variety of interesting topological structures. We also use this data set to highlight how topological signatures help users explore a high-dimensional data set. After this, we show the results of our analysis of high-dimensional feature space data from cultural heritage. Our method enables the identification of relevant structures in the feature space. We use these structures to distinguish the writing, i.e. cuneiform characters, from the background of cuneiform tablets. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Synthetic data set</head><p>In order to evaluate our analysis pipeline and highlight its interaction capabilities, we generated a synthetic data set that contains a number of topological features: We sample three distinct topological objects at random—a circle, two nested circles, and a torus. The center of each of these objects is placed at random in the data set. We then embed each object in a high-dimensional space by using the subgroup algorithm of Diaconis and Shashahani <ref type="bibr" coords="6,160.70,317.90,13.74,8.12" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Briefly put, this algorithm can be used to calculate a random element of SO(n), i.e. the special orthogonal group of n × n matrices, which describes rotations in an n-dimensional space. We now pad the coordinates of each object with zeros and apply the rotation matrix. The result is a seemingly highdimensional point cloud containing discrete samples of objects from R 2 and R 3 . As a last step, in order to simulate real-world data sets, we add 25% noisy data points using Gaussian noise with µ = 0 and σ equal to half the average distance of the points around each object. For the analysis, we first apply the clustering algorithm to the point cloud. Since the data set is not very complicated, the clustering algorithm perfectly recovers the three objects, yielding a classification rate of 100%. See <ref type="figure" coords="6,73.04,437.45,24.78,8.12">Fig. 4a</ref>for the resulting persistence diagram and <ref type="figure" coords="6,247.59,437.45,25.28,8.12">Fig. 4b</ref>for the point cloud and its cluster associations. The three objects show up as three points of infinite persistence in the persistence diagram. This is indicated by the three red points on the x-axis of the diagram. Note that the remaining points are of finite persistence because they are coloured differently. The information that three distinct objects have been identified already conveys some insight into the data set. In order to improve this insight, we also calculate a topological signature for each object—see <ref type="figure" coords="6,125.48,517.15,21.36,8.12">Fig. 7</ref>for a combined display and <ref type="figure" coords="6,251.52,517.15,21.36,8.12">Fig. 9</ref>for the corresponding persistence diagrams (which we included for comparison reasons). The signature clearly highlights in what ways these objects differ: For the first cluster (<ref type="figure" coords="6,176.82,547.04,23.78,8.12">Fig. 7a</ref>), we have a single large persistence generator in dimension 1. Thus, this cluster has the topology of a circle and the generator corresponds to the " hole " that is bounded by the circle. For the second cluster (<ref type="figure" coords="6,190.00,576.93,22.89,8.12">Fig. 7c</ref>), we obtain two generators of large persistence in dimension 1 and many generators of lesser persistence. Further interaction with the persistence rings shows that the plethora of less-persistent generators corresponds to circular structures of the torus. These structures are detected at a very early distance level by persistent homology—hence their relatively large persistence—but they are destroyed as soon as the simplicial complex has been expanded. The two prominent generators, on the other hand, correspond to the two circles that create the torus. In dimension 2, the second cluster has a single persistent generator, indicating an enclosed cavity or void. All in all, this suggests the topology of a torus for the second cluster. For the third cluster (<ref type="figure" coords="6,159.46,686.52,23.70,8.12">Fig. 7b</ref>), we again identify two generators of large persistence in dimension 1, as well as some generators of low persistence. Interaction again shows that each of the persistent generators corresponds to the " holes " bounded by each circle while the less-persistent generators correspond to topological noise that occurs during the expansion of the simplicial complex. Note that (c). H 1 and H 2 of the torus <ref type="figure" coords="7,31.50,280.59,19.38,7.64">Fig. 9</ref>. Persistence diagrams for the detected clusters of the synthetic data set.

Also, we do not make any assumptions about the structures that are embedded in the data set. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> 6.2 Analysing the 16-dimensional feature space of Multiscale Integral Invariant (MSII) filters </head><p>Our second application is rooted in the field of cultural heritage: Cuneiform tablets are among mankind's earliest form of written documents . These are clay tablets of varying shapes and sizes that have been inscribed using blunt reeds. The impressions and indentations left by the writing device are shaped like wedges, hence the name cuneiform (from the Latin word cuneus, meaning " wedge " ). At present, there are several hundreds of thousands of different cuneiform tablets. Only few experts in assyriology are capable of their transcription , transliteration, and translation. Since the tablets are often damaged , this process is very time-consuming. Previous approaches for automatic character extraction involved the use of photography of 2D scanners, which proved to be very errorprone . Recently, the rise of precise 3D scanners facilitated the creation of digitized versions of the cuneiform tablets. These meshes preserve geometrical and topological information, making them suitable for further analysis. Our work builds on methods introduced by Mara et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,72.98,552.79,14.19,8.12" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,89.63,552.79,10.65,8.12" target="#b20"> 21]</ref>. Briefly put, this work involves the calculation of a multiscale filter for meshes of cuneiform tablets. This Multiscale Integral Invariant (MSII) filter was introduced by Pottmann et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,88.57,583.84,14.94,8.12" target="#b28">[29] </ref>for feature detection on 2D manifolds embedded in R 3 . The filter requires input data in the form of a polygonal mesh, i.e. a triangulated point cloud. At any point p ∈ R 3 of the input mesh, the volume integral invariant V r (p) is defined as the integral of the indicator function of the mesh domain D, evaluated within a Euclidean ball B of radius r around p, </p><formula>i.e. V r (p) = p+rB 1 D (x)</formula><p>dx. The volume descriptor is then normalized such that V r (p) ∈ <ref type="bibr" coords="7,211.72,644.82,23.55,8.97">[−1, 1]</ref>. Instead of calculating V r (p) for a single radius r, Pottmann et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,234.26,655.34,14.94,8.12" target="#b28">[29] </ref> now define a scale of 16 decreasing radii r 1 , . . . , r 16 . Then, they evaluate V r (p) for each radius, and assign each point p ∈ R 3 its feature vector </p><formula>f p = (V r 1 (p), . . . ,V r 16 (p)) ∈ R 16 . </formula><p>The set of all 16-dimensional feature vectors is called the feature space of the mesh. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,199.19,696.48,82.70,8.12;7,31.50,706.45,40.37,8.12">Pottmann et al. furthermore show </ref>that the feature space yields a very accurate measure of the local convexity or concavity of a point in the mesh. The multiple scales ensure that even small variations in the shape of the mesh can be detected. Mara et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,345.81,53.30,14.94,8.12" target="#b21">[22] </ref> now suggest a preliminary character extraction algorithm operating on this feature space. Their proposed technique uses the convolution of feature vectors, combined with a thresholding procedure . However, there are several problems: (i) The calculation of feature vectors requires a start radius and a number of scales. Incorrect choices will make the character extraction process error-prone. (ii) A threshold cannot be easily chosen. Furthermore, the extraction is very unstable with respect to small changes to the threshold. (iii) The results of the extraction process cannot be validated automatically. Our topological exploration method now operates on the 16- dimensional feature space (i.e. we do not use the connectivity of the input mesh), providing solutions to the problems outlined above: First, using persistence-based clustering, we partition the feature space into several clusters. These clusters describe different regions in the mesh of a cuneiform tablet. Second, using topological signatures, we can quickly decide whether a data set contains meaningful structures. This is a first step towards automatic validation of the extraction process . Third, we highlight instabilities in the feature vector calculation, which warrants further research into integral invariants. At last, by interacting with the persistence rings, we discover a previously unknown complicated nested relationship of several classes of feature vectors. In the following sections, we describe the results of our topological analysis. We deliberately only use homological information from dimension 0 (for the clustering) and dimension 1 (for the signature calculations). Although our method handles arbitrary dimensions, the restriction to H 0 and H 1 reduces the complexity of our analysis, while retaining sufficient information about the high-dimensional space to enable us to derive valuable clues about the spatial structure of different features. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1">" Kaskal " data set</head><p>We first analyse a synthetic mesh depicting the cuneiform character " Kaskal " . In contrast to real-world data, this mesh has fully planar parts. In addition, the indentations are executed perfectly and there are no damaged parts. <ref type="figure" coords="7,383.50,396.33,30.72,8.12">Fig. 12a</ref>depicts an orthographic projection of the mesh with virtual illumination. Using the dendrogram from <ref type="figure" coords="7,294.12,416.25,25.15,8.12">Fig. 10</ref>, we experimented with values for ε in the range of 0.075– 0.125. All these parameters roughly yielded the same persistence diagram , which is shown by <ref type="figure" coords="7,386.45,436.18,24.00,8.12">Fig. 10</ref> . Application of the persistence clustering algorithm resulted in 12 clusters—see <ref type="figure" coords="7,461.23,446.14,29.17,8.12">Fig. 12b</ref>. The clusters provide a very good partition of the cuneiform character into several parts. Firstly, note that the majority of points are assigned to the largest cluster (shown in orange). It comprises the locally planar parts of the mesh. Thus, parts of each V -shaped wedge are also assigned to this cluster. Secondly, the red cluster describes the " bottom " part of each V -shaped wedge. Finally, the remaining clusters contain points that describe various substructures of the mesh—the green cluster, for example , contains points where two or more wedges intersect. <ref type="figure" coords="7,304.08,536.23,25.26,8.12">Fig. 11</ref>shows three representative persistence rings for the data set, describing the orange cluster (<ref type="figure" coords="7,405.23,546.19,27.42,8.12">Fig. 11a</ref>), the green cluster (<ref type="figure" coords="7,509.31,546.19,27.72,8.12">Fig. 11b</ref>), and the red cluster (<ref type="figure" coords="7,369.97,556.15,27.95,8.12">Fig. 11c</ref>). Note that even by visual inspection, the differences in the clusters are apparent. Thus, without relying on information such as the cluster size, which might be misleading for noisy data sets, users can reliable distinguish different clusters from each other. Furthermore, we found that the large number of generators for the orange cluster indicates literal " holes " in the parameter space: There are several sets of points belonging to the orange cluster that bound other clusters in the data set. In contrast, for the remaining clusters, we discovered that the number of generators of large persistence varies only between 2 and 3. Again, we identified points that bound other clusters. Points of the orange cluster permeate the complete feature space, while the smaller clusters only bound some smaller parts of it. So far, these findings indicate a complex nested relationship between the different clusters, making further studies necessary. This relationship was hitherto not explored and we are convinced that it can be exploited to further improve the quality of the segmentations. In summary, with the " Kaskal " data set, we studied several relevant surface structures of a cuneiform tablet while keeping data artefacts as <ref type="figure" coords="8,22.50,177.71,23.09,7.64">Fig. 10</ref>.

The clearly separated areas in the persistence diagram are due to the synthetic origin of the data set: There is only a single off-diagonal point of finite persistence; the remaining points of finite persistence are all situated along the diagonal, indicating that they have a persistence of 0.

Here, we identified a single persistent generator that bounds cluster 8. Finally, cluster 8 contains points at the " ridges " of the cuneiform signs. Again, its topology is similar to that of the other clusters. small as possible. The topological signatures, represented as persistence rings, demonstrate that the multivariate feature space contains complex high-dimensional structures. These structures differ for different parts of the data set (such as the cuneiform signs themselves and the background of the clay tablet). In this analysis, we explored and explained the resulting structures. We found typical characteristics that manifest themselves in the topological signature, i.e. the persistence rings. These characteristics look alike even for different cuneiform signs, as we will demonstrate in the next section. We separated the feature vectors of the " Kaskal " data set into several clusters with unique signatures, which we hope to further exploit in the future—ultimately, we strive to obtain a reconstruction of impressions of individual wedges or cuneiform signs. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2">" HOS G8 " data set</head><p>To test our methods on real-world data, we selected a digitized cuneiform tablet, designated " HOS G8 " by the Heidelberger Objektsammlung . With 344694 vertices and 689384 faces, the local resolution of the cuneiform characters is very high and covers even small details such as fingerprint. However, the high resolution also renders automatic character extraction very difficult. Our initial analysis showed that the feature vectors for real-world data contain much noise. The noise is not only caused by instabilities of the feature vectors, but also by imperfectly imprinted cuneiform characters. For the complete data set, we encountered many spurious persistence intervals that aggravated our analysis. Hence, we manually selected several regions of interest in the mesh and analysed them instead of the larger data set. </p><p>(a). Mesh with virtual lighting (b). Segmented mesh without lighting <ref type="figure" coords="8,285.12,196.48,23.69,7.64">Fig. 12</ref>. For validating our topological approach, we used a synthetic mesh depicting the " Kaskal " cuneiform sign. With 1233 vertices and 2432 faces, the underlying mesh is small enough for the feature vector calculation to work in real-time. The image to the left depicts an orthographic projection of the mesh using virtual illumination to highlight the ridges. The image to the right shows the result of our clustering algorithm . We detect 12 distinct clusters that describe regions of different curvature in the mesh—see Sec. 6.2.1 for a detailed discussion. In addition to less noise, this also effectively reduced the running time of our algorithm from 300s for the complete data set to a mere 5s–10s. Despite the reduced data set, however, dendrograms proved to be impractical for choosing ε. We thus resorted to estimating the average distance of points in the feature space by randomly selecting a fraction of points and querying their k nearest neighbours (with k ∈ <ref type="bibr" coords="8,503.89,474.38,13.93,8.97" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,518.82,474.93,10.01,8.12" target="#b19"> 20]</ref>). For each selected point p, we calculated the mean distance m p to its neighbours. The mean of all m p values then yielded a good estimate of the average point distance for the complete point cloud. We then proceeded heuristically by setting ε to multiples of this estimate. While this procedure proved to be sufficiently easy to follow and provided us with several partitions, we aim to improve the selection process for ε in a future publication. <ref type="figure" coords="8,295.08,555.82,25.81,8.12" target="#fig_7">Fig. 13</ref>shows an example persistence diagram that is obtained for one of the regions of interest of the cuneiform tablet. Note that this diagram also contains a clear separation of topological noise (along the diagonal) and topological features (along the bottom). Upon increasing ε further, these components will quickly be merged into a single large cluster. This is due to the skewed density distribution of the data set: Each mesh contains a large amount of " regular " , i.e. planar or almost planar, data points, which results in a large density. The nonplanar points, however, are very different from each other, and will rather be merged into the cluster of regular points. To counteract this, we selected a value for ε that resulted in a fair distribution of points and merged each cluster into its nearest neighbouring cluster. This resulted in a segmentation of the data set such that the skeleton of a cuneiform sign is extracted. <ref type="figure" coords="8,348.28,685.33,36.12,8.12">Fig. 1 and</ref><ref type="figure" coords="8,386.64,685.33,25.41,8.12">Fig. 14</ref>show our segmentations. The analysis of the topology of each data set agrees with our analysis from Sec. 6.2.1. First of all, we note that those clusters that contain points in the background exhibit the same topology regardless of the number of points: <ref type="figure" coords="8,370.56,726.37,30.53,8.12">Fig. 15a</ref>(for a larger region of interest) and <ref type="figure" coords="8,285.12,736.33,30.09,8.12">Fig. 15c</ref>(for a smaller region of interest) show the persistence rings (a). First region of interest (b). Second region of interest (c). Third region of interest <ref type="figure" coords="9,31.50,296.47,23.33,7.64">Fig. 14</ref>. Several regions of interest for the " HOS G8 " data set. Due to the high mesh density, as depicted in <ref type="figure" coords="9,163.61,305.93,27.07,7.64">Fig. 14a</ref>, we removed parts of the mesh (hence the uneven borders) in order to obtain a smaller data set. corresponding to points in the background of <ref type="figure" coords="9,200.40,356.60,30.15,8.12">Fig. 14a</ref>and <ref type="figure" coords="9,249.49,356.60,28.59,8.12">Fig. 14c</ref>, respectively. The large number of generators describes the previously encountered phenomenon: The feature space contains a plethora of " holes " that bound smaller clusters (again corresponding to parts of the cuneiform characters). In contrast to that, less generators show up in the persistence rings that corresponding to the writing on the tablet—see <ref type="figure" coords="9,75.07,416.37,47.06,8.12">Fig. 15b and</ref><ref type="figure" coords="9,125.35,416.37,29.20,8.12">Fig. 15d</ref>. By merging the smaller clusters into a single large one, we combine their topological features. Just as in the case of the " Kaskal " data set, the persistence rings suggest a nested relationship—which strengthens our previous analysis. Note that the topological structure of these clusters is not as rich as for the " background " cluster. This is caused by too much noise in the feature vectors, which explains the instabilities of the thresholding approach as well as the failure of automated character extraction. Thus, our topological analysis suggest new directions for the calculation of feature vectors. Namely, by varying the feature vector radii based on local densities, we expect better results, indicated by a richer topological structure. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION &amp; FUTURE WORK</head><p>We introduced a novel method for exploring a high-dimensional data set. To this end, we coupled a topologically-based clustering algorithm with the calculation of topological signatures. We used these signatures to distinguish clustered objects by their topology. In addition , we introduced persistence rings, a novel visualization technique for the persistence intervals that are created by persistent homology calculations. We combined our new visualization with persistence diagrams and persistence barcodes, thereby allowing an interactive exploration of a high-dimensional data set. We demonstrated the viability of our method using two classes of data sets: First, we provided an in-depth analysis of a synthetic data set that contains several topological objects. Our persistence rings visualization detects the differences between the individual clusters, thereby showing the advantages of coupling clustering algorithms with topological signatures. Second, we analysed the 16-dimensional feature space of filter responses for cultural heritage data. Our method detects hitherto unknown structures in the feature space, revealing complicated nested relationships. Moreover, by clustering the feature space, we were able to segment virtual cuneiform tablets into parts containing (a). H 1 of the cluster describing the background of <ref type="figure" coords="9,365.98,148.71,28.80,7.64">Fig. 14a</ref>(b).

Persistence rings for H 1 , i.e. the first homology group, of the different regions of interest shown in <ref type="figure" coords="9,424.00,296.51,22.89,7.64">Fig. 14</ref>. writing (i.e. cuneiform characters) and parts containing only the background . While feature space information was previously exploited by different means, our method does not suffer from instabilities in the data and requires no complicated thresholding. Thus, by operating on a 16-dimensional feature space, our segmentation facilitates cuneiform character extraction for 3-dimensional data and allows further postprocessing . Automatic character extraction is an important goal for assyriologists, who have to deal with the transcription of several hundreds of thousands of (often damaged) cuneiform tablets. For future work in this area, topological signatures should include a better localization of features, i.e. assigning each homology generator feature a geometrical meaning. In the synthetic torus data set, for example, one generator should correspond to points around the " tube " of the torus, while the other one should correspond to points around the " hole " . In the video accompanying this publication, we show an implementation of a simple localization procedure. It works, however, only for extremely simple data sets. A potential solution for the localization problem was recently presented by Zomorodian and Carlsson <ref type="bibr" coords="9,327.74,517.49,13.74,8.12" target="#b38">[40]</ref>. Furthermore, the different ways of creating simplicial complexes should be examined—witness complexes <ref type="bibr" coords="9,451.83,537.42,9.52,8.12" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, for example, are an alternative to the Vietoris-Rips expansion. At last, future research should investigate several metrics for R ε . Throughout this paper, only the Euclidean metric was used. However, using approaches such as metric learning, domain knowledge may be added to the creation of R ε , thereby further improving the quality of the results—see Yang <ref type="bibr" coords="9,314.89,597.19,14.94,8.12" target="#b34">[36] </ref>for a comprehensive survey. </p></div>

			<note place="foot">(a). H 1 of the circle (b). H 1 of the nested circles (c). H 1 and H 2 of the torus Fig. 7. Persistence visualizations for the detected clusters of the synthetic data set. In comparison to a barcode, the persistence rings show the data in a more compact and aesthetically pleasing way, allowing faster comparisons between different signatures. As described in Fig. 4a, each sector is colourized according to its relative persistence value. See Sec. 6.1 for a detailed discussion of the data set and its persistent homology. the third cluster is shown to behave differently than the second cluster. Our signature does not show any topological features in dimension 2, which is justified because the nested circles do not enclose a cavity. Hence, even without any further inspection of the data set, persistence rings serve to distinguish the torus from the nested circles, both quantitatively (more persistence intervals) and qualitatively (non-empty persistent homology in dimension 2). In order to obtain information about the scale of the detected features , we added the option of colouring persistence rings according to the lengths of their associated boundary chains. More precisely, the persistent homology calculation [39] yields a boundary chain for each persistence interval. By counting the number of simplices the boundary chain consists of, we obtain an approximation of the size of the corresponding feature. Fig. 8 depicts the size of several features of the synthetic data set. In summary, we obtain an understanding of intrinsic properties of structures in a data set without overly relying on their actual coordi(a ). Persistence ring of H 1 for the torus (b). Persistence ring of H 1 for the nested circles Fig. 8. For these persistence ring visualizations, we colourized the annular sectors by the lengths of their boundary chains (using the colour map from Fig. 4a), thereby obtaining a visualization of the scales of the detected topological features. For the torus cluster on the left, we see that its first persistent generator does not contain many points because it corresponds to the circle that goes around the &quot; hole &quot; bounded by the torus. The second generator, on the other hand, contains more points as it goes around the &quot; tube &quot; of the torus. For the cluster of nested circles (right), we see that both circular features have roughly the same number of data points.</note>
