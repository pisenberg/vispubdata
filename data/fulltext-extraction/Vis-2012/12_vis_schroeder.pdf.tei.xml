Abstract—A fundamental characteristic of fluid flow is that it causes mixing: introduce a dye into a flow, and it will disperse. Mixing can be used as a method to visualize and characterize flow. Because mixing is a process that occurs over time, it is a 4D problem that presents a challenge for computation, visualization, and analysis. Motivated by a mixing problem in geophysics, we introduce a combination of methods to analyze, transform, and finally visualize mixing in simulations of convection in a self-gravitating 3D spherical shell representing convection in the Earth&apos;s mantle. Geophysicists use tools such as the finite element model CitcomS to simulate convection, and introduce massless, passive tracers to model mixing. The output of geophysical flow simulation is hard to analyze for domain experts because of overall data size and complexity. In addition, information overload and occlusion are problems when visualizing a whole-earth model. To address the large size of the data, we rearrange the simulation data using intelligent indexing for fast file access and efficient caching. To address information overload and interpret mixing, we compute tracer concentration statistics, which are used to characterize mixing in mantle convection models. Our visualization uses a specially tailored version of Direct Volume Rendering. The most important adjustment is the use of constant opacity. Because of this special area of application, i. e. the rendering of a spherical shell, many computations for volume rendering can be optimized. These optimizations are essential to a smooth animation of the time-dependent simulation data. Our results show how our system can be used to quickly assess the simulation output and test hypotheses regarding Earth&apos;s mantle convection. The integrated processing pipeline helps geoscientists to focus on their main task of analyzing mantle homogenization.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The development of efficient and flexible flow simulation techniques over the last years has allowed physical flow modeling to reach a wide range of increasingly complex application areas. An important application field with a more limited visualization history than classic areas, such as aerodynamics, is the field of geophysical flow analysis, where convection in the Earth's mantle is studied extensively. Flow behavior in the Earth's mantle is inherently different from  classical FlowVis application areas: we are concerned with flow behavior of slowly moving materials in large physical volumes and over huge time-scales, i. e. billions of years. This results in very low resolutions in space and time compared to the physical extend of the model. Because of the low temporal resolution of the input data (only every 500th timestep is stored) the expressiveness of classical flow visualization , e. g. pathlines, is limited. Increasing the temporal resolution also linearly increases the storage requirements which is already unfeasible for a factor of 10. In this paper we are concerned with the visualization and analysis of thermodynamic convection in the Earth's mantle. This geodynamic process results in viscous flow-like movement of parts of the mantle at a scale of thousands of years, caused by a heated core and cold surface. As it is common in Computational Fluid Dynamics corresponding simulations are done in a dimension-less domain. A lack of dedicated geophysical visualization systems makes analysis of the mixing process and mantle homogenization behavior a difficult task. In this work we develop a novel and efficient visualization framework to support an in-depth analysis of mantle convection and provide further insights into quantitative and qualitative properties of this transport process. Our system is able to efficiently process large geophysical data, including full-earth convection simulations, and converts them into a representation suitable for efficient numerical processing and visualization . For the analysis of flow behavior, the system is able to perform parallel tracking of positions of hundreds of thousands of mantle flow particles over hundreds of time steps. The presented efficient tracking technique supports the concurrent computation and visualization of meaningful flow statistics such as particle densities, conveying key information about flow behavior to geophysicists. Although the statistics yields a scalar field, isosurfacing cannot be used for visualization in a meaningful way due to the lack of surface-like structures. Instead, we make use of enhanced volume rendering techniques. As a consequence, this work contributes a visualization framework that overcomes classic challenges in geophysical mantle flow analysis by introducing a novel, geophysically motivated parallel processing and visualization pipeline. It provides the necessary tools for us and other geophysicists to easily handle large 3D mantle convection data sets, eases visual perception of flow behavior by the use of 3D volume rendering techniques, and allows efficient depiction of flow behavior in a time-varying full-earth model. This enables us to test hypotheses about quantitative and qualitative properties of mantle convection. This paper is the result of a close collaboration of computer scientists and geophysicists. Thus, the software and solutions are direct responses to the requirements from geophysics and have been developed iteratively. Both parties equally contributed to the paper, providing an insight not only into the design and implementation decisions made by computer scientists, but also into the requirements and perspectives of geoscientists. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related work, both from the field of scientific visualization and geophysics. Next, in Section 3 we provide the geophysical background and motivate the development of our system. This is followed by a system description in Section 4: we explain the output given by the simulation tool CitcomS and how this data is transformed for fast access by our software. Section 5 derives the computation of tracer concentrations which are the statistics used for our visualization. Subsequently, we detail different visualization techniques used in our software in Section 6. Especially, we comment on the details of our tailored version of Direct Volume Rendering. Finally, in Section 7 we evaluate our software by showing different examples and explicate the geophysical insights that were gained from putting the visualization tool to use. The last section, Section 8, concludes our work and gives an overview of possible future directions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>The techniques and methodologies we develop for visualization of flow in mantle convection are related to research in the field of flow visualization and simulation as well as geophysical data analysis. In the following we introduce the relevant related work from both fields. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Flow Visualization </head><p> In the field of flow visualization, the computation of particle trajectories along with particle tracking is a wellknown visualization technique. Dense sets of traced particles have been observed to be carriers of important flow information which can be extracted by boolean predicates or attributes <ref type="bibr" coords="2,196.64,556.37,14.19,8.12" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,213.48,556.37,11.21,8.12" target="#b16"> 17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,227.33,556.37,11.96,8.12" target="#b20"> 21] </ref> or divergence or convergence statistics as in Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent visualization<ref type="bibr" coords="2,67.26,576.29,10.33,8.12" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Such trajectory data are available from simulation tools that compute particle trajectories along with the flow field. We make use of this data to be able to process statistics of millions of trajectories efficiently, while avoiding expensive computation of large sets of trajectories, as common in particle systems visualization <ref type="bibr" coords="2,255.72,616.14,13.74,8.12" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.

Our approach utilizes tracers given by a flow simulation software , whose trajectories correspond directly to pathlines as used in integration-based flow visualization. For an overview of different flow visualization techniques we refer to the survey paper by MacLoughlin et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,42.60,686.52,13.74,8.12" target="#b12">[13]</ref> . We decided to refrain from using pathline visualization itself . In engineering, domain scientists are often interested in the flow around or behind an object, or are able to reduce it to a 2D problem. In our case we work with a symmetric flow field domain without any obstructing objects. Another difference to classic application areas of flow visualization is that in most cases it is sufficient to start pathlines from only one side of the flow volume based on inflow/outflow boundary conditions to probe the complete flow field. The flow volume of the spherical shell of the Earth, however, is self-contained without any inflow or outflow or preferred direction. Hence, tracers are uniformly distributed throughout the entire flow volume. Geophysics Mixing in two dimensions has been visualized using passive tracers <ref type="bibr" coords="2,338.70,117.17,9.71,8.12" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,350.24,117.17,6.72,8.12" target="#b7"> 8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,358.79,117.17,6.72,8.12" target="#b2"> 3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,367.35,117.17,11.95,8.12" target="#b14"> 15] </ref>or lines <ref type="bibr" coords="2,409.18,117.17,14.19,8.12" target="#b22">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,425.20,117.17,10.65,8.12" target="#b23"> 25]</ref> .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">GEOPHYSICAL BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION</head><p>The Earth's mantle is a dynamic system that undergoes convection under the elevated pressures and temperatures in the deep interior of the planet; this flow takes place over billions of years and is the driving mechanism of plate tectonics <ref type="bibr" coords="2,391.72,258.05,13.74,8.12" target="#b24">[26]</ref>. Because geoscientists can neither travel back in time nor travel into the interior of the planet, proxies are used to study mantle convection , including isotopic variability of naturally occurring trace elements (which provide information about the integrated history of the planet) and seismic imaging (which provides a snapshot of the present structure <ref type="bibr" coords="2,319.71,317.84,13.44,8.12" target="#b15">[16]</ref>). These and other observations are complemented by computational simulation of mantle convection <ref type="bibr" coords="2,456.25,327.80,13.75,8.12" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Geologic processes introduce naturally occurring tracers into the mantle; mantle convection mixes these (for example <ref type="bibr" coords="2,479.48,347.74,10.08,8.12" target="#b8">[9]</ref> ) and the resulting heterogeneity is observable in mantle-derived volcanic rocks <ref type="bibr" coords="2,285.12,367.66,9.71,8.12" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,298.31,367.66,10.64,8.12" target="#b29"> 31]</ref>. Understanding the timescales and spatial extent of mixing in the Earth's mantle is required to interpret these observations. This problem has long been a topic of study, but it has not been resolved in part because it is challenging to fully characterize mixing in 3D <ref type="bibr" coords="2,285.12,407.52,9.71,8.12" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,297.07,407.52,6.72,8.12" target="#b4"> 5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,306.04,407.52,10.65,8.12" target="#b25"> 27]</ref>. The goal of the research presented in this paper is the processing of mantle convection simulation data in a way that allows efficient and interactive analysis of mantle homogenization. Insights gained from such a visual analysis help geoscientists understand local flow behaviors , find areas of special interest, and interpret details not possible using bulk statistics. The data used here are the result of simulations of mantle convection in a spherical shell representing the Earth's mantle. These simulations were carried out using a well-established finite element code, CitcomS, which computes the solution to the governing equations for conservation of mass, momentum, and energy <ref type="bibr" coords="2,455.98,517.13,14.19,8.12" target="#b28">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,473.02,517.13,10.64,8.12" target="#b13"> 14]</ref> . For the purposes of this work, we solved the equations for an incompressible fluid (the Boussinesq approximation). The boundary conditions for this simulation were uniform hot and cool temperatures at the lower and upper surfaces, and no-stress boundary conditions at both surfaces. The calculations start from an initial condition and are run through a transient state. Passive, massless tracers are introduced to allow the domain scientists to assess the rate and extent of mixing. Classical approaches for visualization either make it hard to understand the structure of the entire 4D flow (visualization of velocity vectors is too cluttered and plotting single pathlines does not convey context ) or does not show the flow itself (plotting isosurfaces of the temperature field only allows the uppermost surface to be seen). Despite these limitations, they have been used by geophysicists for most visualization activities. We will return to these visualization techniques (which have been implemented in this program to allow researchers to identify regions of interest) in Section 6. The implementation of isosurfaces allow these new methods to seemlessly integrate into the experiences of geoscientists by helping to identify the plume regions. Plumes are thermal upwellings and downwellings in a convection system that carry mass and heat. In the context of mantle convection, the term is generally used more restrictively , to refer to narrow, pipe-like upwellings. Because plumes transport mass, they are agents of mixing and they also sample regions of the Earth's interior which they carry to the surface (the only part of the earth we can sample directly). As a solution to the visualization problem the authors, a group of computer scientists and geophysicists, cooperated to identify derived properties from the simulation that provide an intuitive view of the flow structure and to develop visualization tools for the model outputs. The results of these efforts are detailed in this paper. The resulting visualization system modifies simulation output to produce dense sets of trackable particle tracers in a large time-varying whole earth simulation . Tracer positions are efficiently sorted into regions of the data set to allow for the computation of meaningful mixing and particle density computations. The animation of these statistics facilitates visual tracking of tracer sets, analysis of the evolution of the dispersal of particles (see <ref type="figure" coords="3,48.18,193.09,28.89,8.12">Figure 1</ref>), and the examination of general mixing properties. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">SYSTEM DESCRIPTION</head><p>In this section we discuss the data source, a geophysical simulation tool named CitcomS, and give an overview about the processing steps used prior to visualization. The overall workflow is shown in <ref type="figure" coords="3,251.80,246.43,23.41,8.12">Figure</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data Output from CitcomS</head><p> We use the finite element method (FEM) code CitcomS to model incompressible convection in a spherical shell. CitcomS divides the spherical shell representing the Earth's mantle into twelve caps, which are then gridded with the FEM mesh (see <ref type="figure" coords="3,186.33,364.36,29.44,8.12">Figure 3</ref> ). The 12 cap geometry avoids typical degeneracies of spherical meshes at the poles in the model domain. CitcomS has the capacity to track active or passive tracers (technically passive tracers correspond to massless particles in flow computations and their trajectories are equivalent to pathlines). We make use of passive tracers to study homogenization; the simulation code was modified to enable the tracking of individual tracers throughout the simulation and the addition of tracers at arbitrary times. Each simulation run was initialized with a perturbed equilibrium and advanced the system without tracers to a statistical steady state. After allowing the simulation to run beyond the initial transient state, we introduced tracers to each of the caps, and continued the simulation. Our initial models were isoviscous with low to medium time-dependent Rayleigh numbers. The nature of this subdivision scheme of 12 gridded caps poses several challenges to the processing and visualization of the simulated flow data that need to be addressed by our implementation. Since positions in the data set are represented in spherical coordinates they are periodic in longitudial direction. Furthermore, because of an equal subdivision along the radial axis cell sizes decrease toward the inside of the shell. This periodicity in combination with the overall curvilinear grid introduces challenges for spatial subdivision schemes, like octrees or cell trees, and cell location and inclusion tests for tracer positions. We provide solutions to these challenges in Section 4.2. All output from CitcomS, velocities and grid or tracer positions, are given in spherical coordinates. Our visualization software uses coordinate and tracer output generated by CitcomS. Coordinate files describe the local mesh of each cap separately. The mesh is regular, implicitly storing neighbor information, and does not change over time. Tracer data on the other hand is stored for each cap and timestep separately in the form of particle positions and IDs. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Handling Coordinate Files</head><p>CitcomS is written as a highly parallel simulation tool for use on a cluster system. In order to reduce necessary communication between the cluster nodes each node is assigned only one part of the spherical shell, corresponding to parallelization over data. In the simplest case there are twelve computing nodes each processing a single cap. The only way to distribute the load to more processes is by a regular subdivision in 3D: each cap is subdivided into eight regions which results inat the same time we have to ensure that it is also consistent with the inclusion test in CitcomS to avoid incorrect tracer classification. The easiest compatible way for the test is the following (see <ref type="figure" coords="4,257.94,443.78,14.95,8.12;4,22.50,453.74,17.23,8.12">Fig- ure 5</ref>): in a first step we clip with the minimum and maximum radius <ref type="figure" coords="4,22.50,557.16,19.12,7.64">Fig. 5</ref>. Geometry of a single cell. For the inclusion test of the point we first clip along the radial axis. In a second step we clip by the surfaces of the pyramid with its apex at the center of the sphere. of the cell in spherical coordinates. All points at the top and bottom share the same radius, respectively. The second step has to be done in Cartesian coordinates because the points at the top or bottom do not lie on the same plane in Cartesian coordinates. Rather the sides of the cell can be defined by four planes in Cartesian coordinates which form a pyramid with its apex in the center of the spherical shell. The final inclusion test is performed by clipping with these four planes. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Converting Tracer Files</head><p>Due to the reasons mentioned in the previous section each process in CitcomS stores all data separately for its own cap. This also applies to tracer files. With our own modification of the CitcomS source code a tracer file, which is stored for each timestep, contains tracers with unique IDs and their positions. </p><p>Our only requirement for tracer data access is that we want to be able to efficiently track a tracer by its ID. This means that for a single timestep we want to be able to access a tracer's data by just its ID. In CitcomS tracers may move between caps during the simulation. As a consequence, it is not clear beforehand which file contains a tracer's data as the simulation advances. Additionally, tracers are not sorted by their ID within a single tracer file. This makes it hard to efficiently look up a tracer just by its ID. The solution to this is quite simple and straight forward: for every timestep we combine the tracer files of all caps and sort the tracers by their ID. This makes tracking tracers easy: for each timestep we can find the tracer data by a simple, but efficient search in the corresponding new tracer file. With this conversion we loose the information in which cap a tracer lies in. But, this information can easily be regained by the use of our cell tree data structure. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Preparing Statistics Computation – Index Maps</head><p> The ability to track and locate tracers throughout the flow field facilitates the computation of tracer concentrations and related statistics. Our collaboration with geoscientists revealed the necessity to provide interactive means to specify regions of interests in the data set, in the following called a box, where tracer concentrations can be evaluated. These boxes do not necessarily have to be aligned with data set caps, but should also allow for more general density and mixing visualization , for example at the bottom of temperature plumes. Our software provides these capabilities by letting the user specify arbitrary boxes in spherical coordinates. Different boxes can help answer different questions as we will see in Section 7. Hence, we have to compute statistics for different collections of boxes repeatedly after each user interaction. Thus, it makes sense to precompute as much of the needed information as possible. This information can then be reused for different queries. Point inclusion tests for different regions constitute a main fraction of the overall computation time spent during density computation. In the simplest implementation we would just test for every combination of tracers and boxes if the tracer is contained in a box. The smallest reasonable simulation has 12 · 48 × 48 × 48 cells with a single tracer in each cell, i. e. a total of 1, 327, 104 tracers. Because of almost equal distribution of the tracers for a test case, where the statistics boxes correspond to the 12 caps of CitcomS, only 1 12 of the inclusion tests will be positive. Thus, for more efficiency we introduce a fast indexing scheme that helps just accessing the parts of the tracer files that are actually needed during statistics computation. In essence, we compute an index map storing directly which tracers are in a cell. Later, we will derive an index map for each box from this data (see Section 5.1). Index maps have to be generated for each timestep separately since the tracers are moving over time. For every timestep we take all tracers and let each descend the cell tree. Once we hit a leaf we store the tracer ID in a list of the corresponding cell. When storing these lists to the file we rather store a direct index to the data in the tracer file instead of the tracer's ID (tracer IDs are not necessarily contiguous and thus there is no direct correlation between the index and the ID). Later, these lists are helpful as we know for every cell which tracers they contain, and as a consequence we can directly access all necessary tracer data in the tracer files for any given cell. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Computation Times</head><p>To give an impression of the computation times for each step we benchmarked an example data set. The used computer is a single cluster node with two Intel Xeon X5660 (2.8 GHz, 6 cores, Hyperthreading ) and 94 GB of main memory. Parallelization has been implemented using OpenMP and used 12 threads during runtime. For these preprocessing steps no graphics card is required. Thus, these computations can be performed on a different – maybe more powerful – computer than the one used for interactive visualization. The input data set contains moderately many timesteps and the lowest reasonable resolution: we stored 179 timesteps at 12 caps with 48 × 48 × 48 cells each and 1 tracer per cell. The raw ASCII output produced by CitcomS is approximately 35.8 GB of data. Storing all information in binary and in our converted formats this is reduced to approximately 16.6 GB. We measured two different times: the CPU time is the accumulated time spent on the CPU as returned by Boost's progress timer class 1 on a SuSE Linux 11 computer and the runtime is the real time measured on the command line (see <ref type="figure" coords="5,162.64,328.21,25.20,8.12" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> ). All times have been averaged over at least five runs. We also looked at the maximum memory usage for every step. From our experience we can tell that 8 GB of RAM are already sufficient. Compared to the whole simulation time in CitcomS the additional time spent for preparation is only a minor overhead. In the table we also included the conversion of the velocity files, which are needed for additional visualizations. The temperature field, for example, is also included in these files. Conversion is mostly straight forward from ASCII to binary data files. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">MANTLE FLOW STATISTICS</head><p> Traditionally, the flow generated by Earth mantle convection simulations is mostly analyzed by applying isosurfacing to the temperature field. This gives some basic insight into the flow field, but does not reveal the true structure of the flow. Several additional methods exist in two dimensions, but they do not scale well to three dimensions. Recently, more research in the area of mantle convection uses passive tracers which are advected with the flow to investigate the structure of flow fields. Commonly, from the tracers a density description is derived. In most cases, tracers are only seeded locally and the whole simulation has to be restarted for new seeding locations. In our approach, however, CitcomS generates a dense set of tracers at once, efficiently sampling the complete flow field. The particle density – throughout this paper called tracer concentration – can then be recomputed for arbitrary boxes by our software. Based on the tracer concentration we compute several statistics that directly answer questions , e. g. about homogenization in the spherical shell. As we have no prior knowledge about useful box positions and sizes, and these might be different for multiple simulations, we provide the user with the capabilities to specify arbitrary boxes in spherical coordinates. We discuss the implication of this in the following. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Statistics Computation</head><p>In the simplest case statistics could be computed for every single cell in the original mesh and later be combined for the visualization. There are two problems with this: first, interaction of the user with more than a million cells would be very complicated, and second a lot of computations would have to be carried out during visualization which would slow down the rendering. Instead, we reduce the resolution of the statistics; letting the user define regions of interest, which we call boxes in this paper. Boxes are defined by the user by specifying a minimum and maximum radius and four vertices in the colatitude/longitude-coordinate space. This makes our approach flexible and adaptive and provides exactly the level of detail that we need to answer a specific research question. We developed our software, the algorithms, the visualization, and the statistics with two basic questions in mind. The first one is: How high is the percentage of tracers remaining in a box after a certain time has passed? </p><p> The idea behind this question is to investigate the overall mixing behavior in the spherical shell. We have " well-mixedness " of a single box if it contains an equal amount of tracers from every box provided that all boxes have the same volume and cover the whole sphere. As an example we can take the twelve caps from the simulation as our boxes. The materials mix well if after some time for every box there is only 1/12 of the tracers originating from the box itself left. Note that this criterion alone is not sufficient to investigate mixing. To answer this first question we need to derive the following properties . First, we have to know the number of tracers which have been initially seeded in a box i. We store this information in a variable initial count i . Second, for every timestep we want to know the percentage of tracers which is still left in a box. Hence, for every timestep and box we count the number of tracers n tracers i (t) which originated from box i itself. For the first timestep this percentage is computed as </p><formula>box percentage i (t) := n tracers i (t) initial count i . </formula><formula>(1) </formula><p> Similarly, we need a quantity that describes the percentage of particles present in a box, if particles were released in multiple boxes or the complete shell. In the first timestep this is simply the ratio of the number of tracers n tracers i within box i to the total number of tracers total count(t) of the entire spherical shell: </p><formula>total percentage i (t) := n tracers i (t) total count(t) . </formula><formula>(2) </formula><p>We then have a good indicator for " well-mixedness " if box percentage i (t) equals total percentage i (t). Gathering information for this computation works as follows. As we suggested before the simplest way of doing this would be to just test for every tracer if it is within this box. But for efficiency reasons we introduced the index map in Section 4.4. Before any statistics computations are performed we find all cells that are at least partially included in the user-defined box. For this we use the same inclusion test described in Section 4.2 testing for every vertex of the cell if it is within the defined box. This information can be reused for every timestep since the geometry is fixed and does not change over time. Using the set of cells contained in the box and the index maps we can directly access the tracers which are within the current box. As cells might only be partially included in the box we always have to check if the tracer is actually contained in the box. The second question, which is important in geophysics, is: </p><p>How do tracers originating from a single box spread? </p><p>This is particularly interesting for the investigation of flow behavior within a plume: tracers from the bottom of a plume are suspected to rise to the top. In our software more advanced queries are possible: the user can select any number of boxes to be defined as combined origin of tracers. This way, the statistics computation can be done with a higher resolution than the visualization itself. This is helpful if the user of our software wants to answer different questions with just one statistics computation. Key to this kind of query is that the software is able to track the origin of tracers. For this, we start by enumerating the boxes. The number 0 is reserved for tracers that are not located in any box, e. g. due to numerical errors or because the union of all boxes does not cover the entire spherical shell. For fast lookup the index of the box a tracer starts from is stored in a hashmap for every tracer ID. Accordingly, the computation of the total percentage i (t) and the box percentage i (t) is different from the computation for the first timestep. Instead of the total number of tracers n tracers i (t) in a box we count the number n i j (t) of tracers originating from box j for every box i. Note that n tracers i (t) = ∑ j n i j (t). Thus the total percentage is derived as </p><formula>total percentage i (t) := ∑ j n i j (t) total count(t) </formula><formula>(3) </formula><p>and the box percentage differentiated by the tracers' origins is box percentage i j (t) := n i j (t) initial count i . </p><formula>(4) </formula><p>Scaling these percentages to a reasonable range yields good transfer functions for the visualization. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Computation Times</head><p>Benchmarking of the computation times for the statistics computation has been done the same way as in Section 4.5. Finding the cells of each box parallelizes well. Unfortunately, looking up the tracers in the files mostly consists of I/O operations. Therefore, this part of the software is only single-threaded. In <ref type="figure" coords="6,153.62,422.95,31.71,8.12" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>" find cells " describes the CPU time spent for finding the cells contained in each box. The row " CPU time " contains the overall time including finding the cells. The complete runtime of a run including all conversions and computations is approximately 1 h : 45 min. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES</head><p>The input to our visualization provided by the simulation software is the same as produced during general pathline visualization. Nevertheless , because of the scientific problem we are trying to solve common approaches to pathline visualization are not suitable. General flow visualization in other application areas is mostly motivated by the flow around an object, especially in material engineering. Applications of this are well-known in the visualization community, e. g. in data sets modeling a Kármán vortex street. These produce interesting flow structures behind the object. But in these cases most of the flow volume is of interest to the domain expert. Hence, seeding strategies highlighting these regions of interest work well. In our case, we are only provided with a symmetric flow domain: there are no additional objects within or preferred directions known. Furthermore, most flow simulations are based on a model with an inflow and outflow region. The Earth itself is a self-contained system without any inflow or outflow. As a consequence, pathlines cannot be seeded on a distinct side of the domain with an inflow boundary condition. Instead, our geophysical problem requires the tracers to be uniformly seeded throughout the entire sphere. Meaningful pathline visualization requires a dense sampling over time. Otherwise the resulting visualization of the pathlines are not smooth or miss details. In order to reduce the amount of data to be visualized, we choose to store only few timesteps of the simulation for visualization, skipping most of them. The simulation itself still runs with full temporal resolution providing accurate results for our snapshots. But, from a geochemical standpoint there is no need for data from all timesteps to investigate mixing: we are only interested in the aggregated long-term behavior of the flow. Individual tracers are not of interest and thus visualizing the exact path is not required. Finally, the animation of the flow simulation over time is the most important and useful contribution of our system. Experiments with general visualization tools like ParaView and VisIt showed that it is not possible to easily get the desired results with general-purpose visualization software. The required user interaction is also very time consuming. Instead, our software is optimized for this single task and only because of this it is possible to achieve a smooth animation. Animation by itself forbids most uses of pathlines: tracers are only seeded in the very first timestep and thus pathline visualization would result in a stationary image. As we can see in Section 7 the timevarying temperature field is very useful in the assessment of the flow. Simple plotting of pathlines would give up the temporal context to this moving temperature field. Most importantly, we reduce the visual clutter and the size of visualization data by the introduction of the particle density in Section 5. In order to solve problems of traditional pathline rendering we use volume rendering for displaying particle densities. This has two advantages: first, in comparison to pathlines we do not need intelligent seeding strategies to reduce visual clutter. By the usually low number of user-defined statistics boxes we do not introduce information overload in the first place. Second, volume rendering has the advantage that because of its transparency it conveys the entire context over the complete spherical shell. This stands in contrast to other methods for visualization of the scalar field of particle densities, e. g. clipping or slicing of an opaque rendering.  For comparison and because it is helpful in geoscience we also implemented the most commonly used methods for visualization of flow behavior. The first visualization uses arrows to show evenly spread velocity vectors (see <ref type="figure" coords="6,363.44,654.53,29.81,8.12" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref>(a)). The problem evident here is that a dense visualization results in too much visual clutter. Further, it is hard to find out where tracers would move over time. A second visualization method is plotting isosurfaces of the temperature field (see <ref type="figure" coords="6,342.07,696.48,29.65,8.12" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref>(b)). This actually proposes the existence of so-called plumes. The isosurfaces in combination with the new visualization help us finding interesting flow regions and asking the right questions with the software. This results in a better understanding what the new visualization means by providing more context. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Modified Direct Volume Rendering</head><p>Volume rendering is implemented using Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) (3D texture slicing <ref type="bibr" coords="7,129.14,76.86,14.34,8.12" target="#b27">[29]</ref> ) in our software. Because of the special application we can simplify the rendering process. The sphere is drawn with radius 1 which means that we can draw the proxy geometry in the form of slices within just the unit cube. Because the slices always have to be parallel to the viewing plane we handle OpenGL's ModelView matrix differently: only the translational part is applied to the slice geometry. Rotations, on the other hand, are applied to the 3D texture, but rotated to the opposite direction. Direct Volume Rendering for a sphere poses new challenges for rendering: towards the center there are more slices than on the outside. This results in more opaqueness in the center (see <ref type="figure" coords="7,212.69,358.65,29.33,8.12" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref>(a) with an additional hole in the center since we are rendering a spherical shell instead of a sphere). Having different transparencies results in different colors. This is a problem because we want to use transfer functions to color-code the tracer concentrations for each box. The solution to this is to compute a constant opacity independent of the number of slices. For this we have to adjust the alpha values according to the number of slices at a given position in the image plane. </p><formula>(a) (b) (c) </formula><formula>z pro j = 1 − r 2 (5) </formula><formula>index = 1 2 (z pro j + 1) · (n slices + 1) − 1 (6) acc slices = 2 · index − 1 2 (n slices − 1) + (n slices mod 2). (7) </formula><p>z pro j projects a point with distance r from the center in the image plane to the furthest DVR slicing plane that is still inside the spherical shell. The second line yields the corresponding index of the slicing plane. Based on this index and the total number n slices of slices we can finally compute the accumulated count acc slices for any arbitrary point (x, y) </p><formula>with x 2 + y 2 = r 2 </formula><p>in the image plane. Since we are just displaying a spherical shell with the radius in the range <ref type="bibr" coords="7,67.25,595.28,28.90,8.97">[0.55, 1] </ref>we need to subtract the slices within the inner core which is just a hole inside the sphere. The computation of the number of slices within the core is done almost identically, but z pro j is computed the following way: </p><formula>z pro j = 0.55 2 − r 2 . </formula><formula>(8) </formula><p>Finally, the corrected alpha value is given by: </p><formula>al pha = 1 acc slices . </formula><formula>(9) </formula><p>The previous computation will result in a smooth rendering with constant opacity (see <ref type="figure" coords="7,111.58,726.37,29.89,8.12" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref> (b)). We slightly adjusted this behavior . First, the outside of the sphere is rendered slightly more opaque than the inside which gives a better 3D impression. Second, we implemented a slight increase in opaqueness from back to front to accentuate features in the front. The result of this can be seen in <ref type="figure" coords="7,488.77,73.22,29.49,8.12" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref>(c) and the images in Section 7. We refrained from using lighting to support the 3D impression since we are using a color map to encode values and additional lighting would distort these colors. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Additional Visualization Techniques</head><p> Since geophysicists are familiar with slicing tools we also implemented basic clipping for volume rendering. The user can specify front and back clipping and shift the clipping box. Another tool that in practice has proven to be useful is spherical clipping. The user can specify a minimum and maximum radius to be rendered. This is useful to geophysicists as they often focus on specific layers of the spherical shell. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Implementation Details</head><p> One of the goals of our software is the rendering of a smooth animation over all timesteps. In order to achieve this goal we used several advanced features of OpenGL. For the Direct Volume Rendering we use a combination of textures computed in software and shader programs on the GPU. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Constant Opacity </head><p> For the modified DVR described in Section 6.1 we create a one-dimensional texture storing the alpha value used to correct for constant opacity. From Equation 5 we see that rendering is only dependent on the radius r in the image plane. This radius is directly used as index to this texture. We obtain the modified DVR from the constant opacity DVR by few additional computations in the fragment shader. 3D Texture Another texture is needed to color map the rendering . The trivial implementation is to use a 3D texture which stores the colors for every pixel. During animation this 3D texture has to be constantly updated, which is too slow for interactive framerates. Instead , we precompute a 3D texture only once containing indices to the boxes. Then, we need another transfer function in the form of a 1D texture storing the current color for each box. The 3D texture then directly indexes into the 1D texture. While now the 1D texture has to be updated in every frame, because of the low number of boxes – low compared to the number of pixels in the 3D texture – and simpler generation of the 1D texture this approach is fast enough. Parallelism The generation of the texture for the next timestep is done in a parallel thread. Similarly, the data needed to render the velocity vectors or the isosurfaces of the temperature field is too large to be entirely loaded into main memory. Hence, during animation we also pre-load the next timesteps of the velocity and temperature field in parallel threads. With this parallel loading and the parallel computations we always have the data at hand when we need it. This is key to a smooth animation of the flow. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">GEOPHYSICAL EVALUATION OF VISUALIZATION RESULTS</head><p> In this section, we discuss the use of the software to investigate geophysical processes. The geophysical motivation for this is that the lavas which erupt at the surface of the planet carry chemical signatures that reflect the integrated history of the system in which they formed. In rocks derived from the Earth's interior, this signature results from a complex set of processes that includes mixing. We cannot observe these processes directly, so must rely on simulations. Because mixing is a complex, even chaotic process, we run ensembles of simulations to test hypotheses. The size and age of " pockets " of heterogeneity (represented by our statistics boxes) are key to understanding the rate of mixing that allows us to interpret the chemical signatures we observe. For the purpose of this paper we restrict ourselves to only few example simulation which show the features of the software. In our examples we have used moderate Rayleigh numbers. These models show weakly time-dependent flows. Animations, combined with traditional visualization techniques and volume rendering provide additional tools for geophysicists investigating mixing in the mantle. The results discussed in this section are only possible because of our new visualization approach and are mostly new to this community. Isosurfaces Our software makes a single isosurface rendering in temperature, isosurfaces being an important and commonly used way to represent this scalar field for analysis. Isosurfaces are computed with the Marching Cubes algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="8,153.90,106.66,13.74,8.12" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, either with a low resolution mesh for fast visualization and easier manipulation during data analysis , or with a full resolution mesh for higher precision observations (e. g. compare Figures 10 and 9). Slicing Many geophysics visualizations use slicing to view data. The implementation of slicing in this program is limited to tracer density data; however, it does allow spherical slicing. This allows us to more clearly see values at specified radii (see <ref type="figure" coords="8,186.63,440.30,28.90,8.12" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref>). Animations The creation of animations in our software allows the migration of features to be followed easily in a time-varying model. Observe several snapshots in <ref type="figure" coords="8,126.56,473.75,28.63,8.12">Figure 9</ref>, where four upwelling, pipe-like plume are shown by the gray isosurface. In the snapshots, this plume facing the reader drifts southward (downward on the page). This shift in the flow pattern is hard to notice without the animation. Also, because the animation is still interactive, it is possible to move the model and still retain a sense of motion in order to look at different aspects of the flow. This is powerful because we retain an idea of the model's internal motion while being able to observe other areas in the simula- tion. Particle Density Visualization The driving motivation of this tool was to see the bulk motion of particles without watching every particle move. That users can select the size of their boxes allows comparisons between different scales. This allows mixing to be studied at a global scale, or at regional convection cells. In our models, we ran a mantle convection simulation until a transient state was reached and then placed a uniform tracer field in the simulation. We tried different user-defined boxes for different visualization purposes. For this paper all boxes are aligned with the grid (they are either just the caps or regular subdivisions of the caps). In the future the software will provide better means for the placement of boxes. Thus, geophysists will try out and find better placement options to answer new research questions. A first observation made possible by this visualization is the time needed for the concentration of particles that originate in a box to be proportional to the volume of the box in the simulation as it should be in a well-mixed system. To investigate the mixing behavior at different scales we chose different sized boxes covering the entire spherical </p><formula>(a) t = 0 (b) t = 20000 (c) t = 36500 (d) t = 53000 </formula><p>(e) t = 73500 <ref type="figure" coords="8,285.12,441.92,19.18,7.64">Fig. 9</ref>. Animations help to see migrations of features in the simulation. The plume in the front is tilting downwards towards the viewer over time. This movement is more apparent when viewing the images in sequence, e. g. as animation with our software. At the same time we observe the movement of tracers (as a bulk unit) seeded at the bottom of the plume (red indicates boxes with a certain amount of tracers originating from the seeding region). </p><p>shell. With the animation we can intuitively observe how dispersion is quicker in some regions, usually covering several neighboring boxes, and how this is dependent on the size of the boxes. This is shown by a change in colors from red to shades of blue. We compare the time needed to achieve this color shift at different scales, see <ref type="figure" coords="8,496.43,574.60,39.08,8.12">Figures 10</ref>(large), 1 (medium), 11 (small boxes). Note how looking at the smaller boxes, shows a faster approach to particle dispersion. This illustrates the need to look at multiple scales when thinking about intermediate mixing states. By looking at the smaller regions, we also are able to see a more complex pattern of movement. In the coarsest resolution, we have colors switch from reds to blues when the concentration in each box represents 80% of the initial value. For the medium resolution, we have that color change happen at 10% (or one eighth the coarsest resolution because there are eight times more boxes). For the finest resolution, we have that change happen at 1% (roughly one eighth the medium resolution because there are again eight times more boxes). These examples also show why using the mesh as a visualization tool is difficult: the finest resolution at this stage obscures important information and the medium resolution display is best at showing complex motion (which is easier to see in animation than in snapshots). The velocity vectors (see <ref type="figure" coords="8,381.58,736.33,30.53,8.12" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref> ) add information about </p><formula>(a) t = 0 </formula><p>(b) t = 222 (c) t = 370 (d) t = 740 (e) t = 18648 <ref type="figure" coords="9,31.50,166.50,23.01,7.64">Fig. 10</ref>. Low resolution statistics with just one statistics box per cap. We can see that initially there is almost no dispersion for the caps on the left and the right (red caps in (d)). Interestingly, caps at least partially containing a plume have better dispersion. <ref type="figure" coords="9,31.50,305.85,22.59,7.64">Fig. 11</ref> . High resolution statistics using 192 boxes: at this scale our necessary condition for good dispersion is easily met within a few timesteps. </p><formula>(a) t = 0 (b) t = 222 (c) t = 740 </formula><p>(a) From an initial state of no dispersion (only red boxes), (b) over some dispersion (purple boxes) we quickly reach a state (c) where the tracers have mostly spread to other boxes (blue boxes with only few own tracers left). neous velocity fields and also can be included in animations. The software also provides means to visualize the movement of particles from one box into the rest of the model. In addition, by selecting seeding boxes near a plume and watching their distribution across the sphere over time, we can watch the mixing process. First, these particles (as a bulk unit) are carried upward by the plume; they spread outward near the surface, then are carried back into the interior by cold downwelling, finally returning towards the plume over time. Because the data is projected translucently, it is easy to look at deeper layers of the data (and far side of the sphere) to allow a better understanding of the data. This kind of visualization helps test our hypothesis about motion of particles rising within the upwelling hot plume. <ref type="figure" coords="9,41.46,504.64,34.90,8.12">Figure 12</ref>gives an example of the dispersion visualization starting from a single seeding box. In contrast to previous visualizations full blue indicates that a box does not contain any particles from the seeding box. In this figure, we use a plume identified as Alpha in order to show the movement associated with this feature. The other plumes behave similarly. Further refinement of particle boxes provide a clearer picture. In this example, the near-steady-state flow suppresses lateral particle transport and mixing. In the future we will investigate better seeding boxes based on the flow pattern. These kinds of visualization provide a fast approach to study the impact of the viscosity to homogeneity of the flow in a new efficient way. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p> In this paper we developed a set of algorithms and visualization techniques , closely collaborating as computer scientists and geophysicists, which help geophysicists analyze Earth's mantle convection. Our approach is converting the fluid movement to a tracer concentration that evolves over time. We provide interactive means to specify boxes that are used to compute statistics. The statistics are based on tracer concentrations and origins. With our visualization we can analyze homogenization processes in the Earth's mantle based on tracer movement. The results show that our full set of tools provides new ways to investigate mixing in the Earth mantle. Our geophysical analysis demonstrates the usefulness of the software. The ability to create sources for <ref type="figure" coords="9,294.12,305.92,23.87,7.64">Fig. 12</ref>. Looking at the configuration from different angles; in (c) the plume is at the back of the spherical shell. We can clearly see that because of the near-steady-state flow materials do not mix well (red boxes contain several particles from the neighborhood of the marked plume, blue boxes only have few or no tracers from this region). tracer statistics close to plume positions or at other relevant flow regions enables us to test different hypotheses about tracer behavior in the mantle flow field easily. For the future, we will integrate our own tracers paths. This will allow for a finer resolution of the statistics by interactively seeding tracers. The advantage of this approach will be that we do not need to rerun the simulation in CitcomS to generate new tracer paths and can specify new interaction techniques for statistics boxes. </p><formula>(a) (b) (c) </formula></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,277.42,246.43,4.48,8.12;3,31.50,256.39,159.17,8.12;3,39.72,277.58,125.52,8.12;3,39.72,288.55,131.24,8.12;3,39.72,299.51,180.82,8.12"><head></head><figDesc>2 and consists of the following essential steps: 1.

			<note place="foot" n="96"> processes in total. Thus, each cluster node operates on its own spatial region. The node will only perform computations on this specific region and output the resulting information to its own files. Consequently , there is no communication or synchronization needed during file I/O. The downside of this approach is that our input data is always split across at least twelve files – one for each cap. This problem has to be resolved for efficiency reasons as detailed in the following. Fig. 3. Illustration of the subdivision scheme used in CitcomS, showing seven of the twelve caps. The highlighted cap is further subdivided. Coordinate files contain the geometric information of the caps, or their subdivisions (see Figure 3). Only the positions of grid points are stored, but as we have a regular mesh the ordering of these vertices implicitly describes the mesh connectivity. Despite the meshes&apos; regularity – each mesh is curvilinear and the space of spherical coordinates is periodic – it is not possible to directly locate a point. However, for some computations we need an efficient way to find out in which cell a given tracer is located in. Spatial subdivision schemes are an obvious solution to this problem . Due to its memory efficiency and the structural layout of the cells we decided to use the cell tree introduced by Garth and Joy [6]. In comparison to an octree the cell tree does not introduce hard cuts for subdivision of the 3D space. Instead, it is an interval tree which allows the domains of children nodes to overlap. This approach usually results in fewer and more equal subdivisions, especially for irregular grids and allows for straight-forward and memory efficient parallelization of cell location. Choosing the right coordinate space for the subdivision scheme is important to keep the memory footprint low, i. e. to have as few subdivisions as possible. For our computations all points are already available in spherical and Cartesian coordinates. Both coordinate spaces have their own problems concerning subdivision. For subdivision in spherical coordinates we have to handle periodicity, which introduces special treatment for cells on the boundaries of the coordinate space. On the other hand, in Cartesian coordinates the cells&apos; bounding boxes, which are needed for the subdivision scheme, are much larger than the cells due to the cells&apos; curved boundaries. This results in a lot of overlap for bounding boxes leading to a very complex cell tree. Testing revealed that the cell tree in spherical coordinates is a more efficient cell locator. Part of the creation of the cell tree involves the construction of bounding boxes for mesh cells. Unfortunately, a closer look at the colatitude/longitude-space of the spherical coordinates reveals that caps do not have straight boundaries in this coordinate space (see Figure 4). In our simulations we mostly used 48 × 48 × 48 cells per cap. This is considered a low – but sufficient – resolution for the simulation, but the cells&apos; edges can already be viewed as straight lines. Hence, the bounding box of a cell can solely be determined by its vertices. Testing for Cell Inclusion Testing for cell inclusion is mainly used to find the cell that a given tracer lies in and is used frequently in our application. Thus, this test should be as efficient as possible and</note>
