				<p>Fig. 1. Classifying objects based on their shape using our cumulative heat diffusion on (a) MRI head, (b) abdominal stent and (c) foot volumetric datasets. The shape-based volume exploration reveals various organs such as kidneys, liver, pancreas and spinal cord (for the abdominal stent), brain, eye sockets and cranium (for the MRI head) and different shaped bones (for the foot). (d) The corresponding heat histogram of the foot data where each vertical line represents a bone of the foot. Abstract—We introduce a simple, yet powerful method called the Cumulative Heat Diffusion for shape-based volume analysis, while drastically reducing the computational cost compared to conventional heat diffusion. Unlike the conventional heat diffusion process, where the diffusion is carried out by considering each node separately as the source, we simultaneously consider all the voxels as sources and carry out the diffusion, hence the term cumulative heat diffusion. In addition, we introduce a new operator that is used in the evaluation of cumulative heat diffusion called the Volume Gradient Operator (VGO). VGO is a combination of the LBO and a data-driven operator which is a function of the half gradient. The half gradient is the absolute value of the difference between the voxel intensities. The VGO by its definition captures the local shape information and is used to assign the initial heat values. Furthermore, VGO is also used as the weighting parameter for the heat diffusion process. We demonstrate that our approach can robustly extract shape-based features and thus forms the basis for an improved classification and exploration of features based on shape.</p>

However, incorporating shape information for volume analysis still remains a challenge.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>nario </head><p>in the case of manifolds, where heat diffusion theory and related techniques have recently become popular for manifold shape analy- sis <ref type="bibr" coords="1,306.00,610.24,13.74,8.02" target="#b27">[29]</ref>. The heat diffusion process, governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) on the shape, captures the geometric information. The heat diffusion process has many useful properties; namely, it is stable , informative, isometric invariant, robust to noise and independent of the initial conditions <ref type="bibr" coords="1,381.91,650.09,13.74,8.02" target="#b27">[29]</ref>. However, the heat diffusion theory has been solely applied to manifolds and no previous attempts have been made to exploit this lucrative heat diffusion process directly for volumes . According to the heat kernel theory, the heat diffusion is successfully able to describe both local and global 3D shape information which forms the motivation of our work. Owing to these merits, this paper focuses on analyzing the volume data using heat diffusion. Directly extending the manifold heat diffusion idea to volumes is not trivial, mainly due to the extremely high computational cost. The computational complexity of the heat diffusion process for discrete surface meshes is of the order t · n 2 , where n is the number of vertices and t is the number of time steps. Due to the huge size of volume data, extending heat diffusion directly would require an impractical amount of time for computation. In order to address this challenge, we introduce the idea of Cumulative Heat Diffusion, through which we are able to perform a shape-based volume analysis, while drastically reducing the computational cost compared to conventional heat diffusion. Unlike the conventional heat diffusion process, where the diffusion is carried out by considering each node separately as the source, we consider all the voxels as sources simultaneously and carry out the diffusion. Accordingly, the initial heat is assigned to all the voxels at once. As a result, the cumulative heat diffusion process can run in parallel for all the voxels in the volume data and hence the final heat on the voxels can be estimated simultaneously. Additionally, we use the GPU for implementation, further reducing the running time. The heat diffusion process which achieved noteworthy results in the case of manifolds is being applied to volume data directly for the first time to capture the relevant and useful shape information. The cumulative heat diffusion method is conceptually sound and simple to implement, which makes it an attractive approach for shape-based volume analysis. The manifold heat diffusion process is governed by the heat kernel evaluation which is expressed using the Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LBO). However, just using the LBO would not suffice for a volumetric data where the intensity of the voxels are encoded to the Reimannian metric. Hence, we propose to use the voxel intensity as a metric by introducing a new operator to evaluate the cumulative heat diffusion process for volumes, called the Volume Gradient Operator (VGO) and the heat diffusion is carried out under this metric. VGO is defined as a combination of LBO and a data driven operator, F v , which is a function of the half gradient. Half gradient is the absolute value of the difference between the voxel intensities. The VGO is used to determine the initial heat values of the voxels and also find the edge weights that monitor the heat diffusion process. To summarise, our paper makes two contributions: First, it provides a simple, yet powerful shape-based volume analysis method using heat diffusion on volume data, which we call cumulative heat diffusion. Second, we introduce a new operator called the Volume Gradient Operator (VGO) that is used to determine the edge weights for the heat diffusion process.The simplicity of our method is in itself a significant contribution. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives background information and reviews the related literature . Section 3 describes the algorithm with a detailed description of the VGO and the cumulative heat diffusion process for volume analysis . We discuss how our heat diffusion process can robustly extract the shape based features in volume data. Various properties of our method are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 discusses applications and Section 6 presents results of our method. Finally, we draw some conclusive remarks along with the future work in Section 7. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Shape has been previously used for volume classification. Sato et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,34.15,576.59,14.94,8.02" target="#b25">[27] </ref>proposed a volume classification based on shape where they detect pre-defined shapes such as edge lines and blobs by measuring the multi-scale responses to 3D filters. Skeleton based approaches were extensively used to study shapes and for shape based volume visualization. Hilaga et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,120.59,616.44,10.45,8.02" target="#b8">[9] </ref>used skeletons for shape matching and volume visualization. Pizer et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,142.57,626.40,14.94,8.02" target="#b18">[19] </ref>proposed a framework of stable medial representation for segmentation of objects, registration and statistical 3D shape analysis. Several other attempts using skeletons for shape-based volume classification was done by Correa et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,246.50,656.29,10.45,8.02" target="#b4">[5] </ref>and Reniers et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,74.07,666.25,13.74,8.02" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Motivated by these ideas, Praßni et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,240.51,666.25,14.94,8.02" target="#b19">[20] </ref>presented a shape-based transfer function using the curve-skeleton of the volumetric structure. However, in all these works, the shape has been pre-defined such as blobs, surfaces and tubes. In contrast, we enforce no shape restrictions. All similar shapes, irrespective of orientation and scaling are recognised and at the same time distinguished from other shapes by our method. Bruckner and Moller <ref type="bibr" coords="2,114.59,736.42,10.45,8.02" target="#b3">[4] </ref>introduced similarity maps for volume analysis in which they represent the similarity of isosurfaces for different isovalues. Later, Haidacher and Bruckner <ref type="bibr" coords="2,450.08,63.35,10.45,8.02" target="#b7">[8] </ref>extended the idea of the similarity maps to multimodal data and used it for analysis, fusion and classification of multimodal data. However, in both cases isosurfaces were used for volume analysis and their approach was based on similarity information and not on the shape information. On the contrary , our method is based on the shape information obtained by the heat diffusion process and the entire process is carried out directly on the voxelized volume data. There are various diffusion based algorithms with different applications such as the watershed-based algorithms (water flow) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,497.50,154.61,9.71,8.02" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,509.77,154.61,11.21,8.02" target="#b13"> 14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,523.55,154.61,11.95,8.02" target="#b22"> 23] </ref> and heat diffusion methods (heat flow). These are governed by different physics laws. Watershed methods depend on both the geometry and the embedding of the shape because of the gravity while heat diffusion only depends on the intrinsic geometry of the shape and the embedding is irrelevant. This paper is motivated by and only focuses on heat diffusion. Heat diffusion theory has been used for over a decade in the case of manifolds, specifically in shape analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="2,489.64,224.35,14.19,8.02" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,506.97,224.35,11.21,8.02"> 25,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,521.30,224.35,10.65,8.02" target="#b24"> 26]</ref>. In order to evaluate the heat diffusion on the entire mesh surface, the heat flow on all the paths of the mesh surface has to be considered and that is why heat diffusion incurs a high computational cost. A multi-resolution approach to evaluate the heat diffusion process was proposed to reduce the running time <ref type="bibr" coords="2,421.88,274.17,13.74,8.02" target="#b28">[30]</ref>. However, no attempt has been made to use the heat diffusion for shape-based volume analysis . For the first time, we apply the heat diffusion theory directly to volumetric data by introducing a Cumulative Heat Diffusion process. The heat diffusion process is governed by the heat kernel. This heat kernel is a recent topic in computer graphics. Heat kernel has been used to define a shape signature called the heat kernel signatures and used for applications such as shape comparisons and feature extractions in a most effective manner <ref type="bibr" coords="2,419.46,355.47,13.74,8.02" target="#b27">[29]</ref>. In addition, heat kernel is applied for various applications like non-rigid shape recognition <ref type="bibr" coords="2,522.80,365.43,9.52,8.02" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, shape matching <ref type="bibr" coords="2,345.52,375.40,13.74,8.02" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, mapping isometries <ref type="bibr" coords="2,441.13,375.40,14.94,8.02" target="#b16">[17] </ref>and to create feature spaces for shape analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="2,376.78,385.36,9.71,8.02" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,388.62,385.36,10.65,8.02" target="#b29"> 31]</ref>. Raviv et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,448.14,385.36,14.94,8.02" target="#b20">[21] </ref> generalized the surface heat kernel signature to present a volumetric heat kernel signature for shape retrieval. The LBO is used to express the heat kernel <ref type="bibr" coords="2,518.32,405.28,13.74,8.02" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Discrete LBO has been defined and its convergence with the continuous case has been discussed in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,398.65,425.21,9.71,8.02" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,410.94,425.21,10.65,8.02" target="#b23"> 24]</ref>. For triangular meshes, one of the most common discretizations of the LBO is by using the cotangent weight scheme <ref type="bibr" coords="2,341.09,445.13,14.94,8.02" target="#b26">[28] </ref>which was originally introduced in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,486.00,445.13,9.71,8.02" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,498.05,445.13,10.65,8.02" target="#b17"> 18]</ref> . However , just using the LBO does not suffice for the volumetric dataset which has the intensity values stored on a regular Cartesian 3D grid (the intensity of the voxels is encoded to the Reimannian metric) . In this paper, we introduce a new operator that is used as the weighting scheme in discrete volumetric data, termed VGO. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">ALGORITHM</head><p>The cumulative heat diffusion is a modified heat diffusion on volumes used for shape-based volume analysis. The diffusion process is carried out by considering all the voxels as sources simultaneously. A new operator, VGO is used to assign the initial heat values and determine the edge weights that monitor the heat diffusion process. At the end of the cumulative heat diffusion, for a certain value of time t, all the voxels will have final heat values. By virtue of the heat diffusion theory, all the voxels belonging to a single object will have the same heat values (for large t). When t is small, all the voxels belonging to the same feature will have the same heat values. In addition, all the objects with similar shape will have the same heat values, independent of their position, scale and orientation (as will be discussed in the Section 4). These heat values of all the voxels at each time step are stored and displayed in a histogram for visualization purposes. This histogram created by using the heat values is used in volume analysis, such as for exploration and classification. The evaluation of the histogram, the interpretation of the information depicted in the histogram and some of the properties of our cumulative heat diffusion are discussed in the Section 4. This cumulative heat diffusion process is simple to implement on volume data, whereas the conventional heat diffusion is not feasible in practice. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Cumulative Heat Diffusion</head><p>We will now introduce the cumulative heat diffusion on volume data where voxels are the data elements. The difference between the normal heat diffusion process and the cumulative heat diffusion is the way the diffusion process is carried out and the way the initial conditions are defined. In the conventional heat diffusion process, the initial heat is assigned by considering one voxel as the source at a time. The initial heat assigned to the source voxel is a fixed constant value not exceeding 1 (it can be any random value less than 1) while the initial heat of all the other voxels is assigned to zero. The heat is diffused from this source voxel for a given number of time steps (t) and at the end, the heat remaining on the source is recorded as the final heat value of that voxel after a time t. This entire process of assigning the initial heat value and carrying out the diffusion is repeated by considering each of the voxels separately as a source. In each step, all the voxels are taken into account to determine the diffusion process. This explains the large time complexity of t · n 2 in the conventional heat diffusion process. To reduce the computational cost, in our cumulative heat diffusion approach , instead of considering each voxel as a source separately, we consider all the voxels as sources simultaneously. The way we do the heat initialization makes it possible for our cumulative heat diffusion to produce results identical to those of the conventional process. Let V be a volume, then the cumulative heat diffusion process over V is governed by the following heat equation: </p><formula>Γ V k(x,t) = − ∂ k(x,t) ∂t (1) </formula><p>where Γ V is the edge weight which is determined by using the VGO of V and k(x,t) is the temperature (heat) at location (voxel) x at time t. Γ V is used to determine the amount of heat flow between voxels in the cumulative heat diffusion process. It is evaluated using Equations 4 and 5 explained in the Section 3.2. Finally on the discrete volume data, the cumulative heat diffusion is estimated using the discrete version of Γ V which is evaluated as follows: </p><formula>Γ V f i = − ∑ j∈N(i) V GO(i, j)( f i − f j ) (2) </formula><p>where N(i) is the set of all the 1-ring neighboring voxels j of voxel i, f is the corresponding heat of the voxels and V GO(i, j) is the weighting factor of the edge between the voxels i and j. We virtually extend the boundary of the volume data so that the heat will go over the boundary and after a large time step the heat of the background voxels will be zero. This virtual extension of the boundary also gets rid of the problem of dealing with the complicated boundary conditions. The solution k(x,t) of Equation 1 with the initial conditions k(x, 0) = InitH(x) determines the amount of heat at voxel x at time t. InitH(x) is the initial heat on voxel x defined by Equation 3 and is pre-computed using the VGO. The respective initial heat values are assigned to all the voxels simultaneously. Thus, the initial heat value assigned to the voxels is not a random fixed constant number (as it was in the case of the conventional heat diffusion), rather each voxel has a different initial heat value decided by using the VGO. The initial heat value InitH(v 0 ) assigned to the source voxel v 0 is determined by using the sum of the weights of the six edges around the voxel so that the initial heat describes the local shapes and is defined as follows: </p><formula>InitH(v 0 ) = 1 − ∑ v∈N(v 0 ) (V GO(v 0 , v)) max ∀i∈N 0 (∑ v ∈N(i) (V GO(i, v ))) </formula><formula>(3) </formula><p>where N 0 is the set of all voxels. Equation 3 is defined such that all the initial heat values lie between 0 and 1 to start with. Finally, for a given time step t, the cumulative heat diffusion process is carried out by allowing the heat assigned using Equation 3 to flow based on Equation 2. As all the voxels are considered as sources simultaneously, the total computational time for the cumulative heat diffusion for a given large time t is of the order t · n where n is the number of voxels in the volume data. Thus, we have reduced the computational time by a factor of n when compared to the conventional heat diffusion. As n is a large number, we have achieved an order of magnitude speed up through the use of our cumulative heat diffusion process in obtaining the shape information of the volume data. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Volume Gradient Operator</head><p>Much information about the structure of the volume can be obtained from the intensity of the voxels and comparing the intensity of the neighboring voxels. A lot of research has gone into using the intensity and the gradient (difference of the intensities with the neighboring voxels) of the voxels for volume analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="3,461.06,143.11,14.19,8.02" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,477.98,143.11,10.65,8.02" target="#b10"> 11]</ref>. Motivated by this idea, we propose to use the intensity of the voxels as a metric to monitor the heat diffusion process in obtaining the shape information. Intensity is a data-driven metric and this will be the first time a datadriven metric is being used in the theory of heat diffusion. In addition, the intensity of the voxels would provide a better initial framework to start the diffusion process rather than starting with a random initial condition. Hence, we propose an operator called VGO that helps in the estimation of the cumulative heat diffusion process. We tried different possibilities such as the method by Levin et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,494.79,232.77,14.94,8.02" target="#b11">[12] </ref>but from our experience our approach gave the best results. The VGO is a modification of the LBO. It considers the intensities on the volume grid points as a metric. The VGO is defined as a combination of LBO and the intensity information, as shown in Equation 4. The LBO term, denoted by ∆, in Equation 4 captures the geometric information of the grid and the F v term considers the intensity information , which is defined by Equation 5 as a function of the half gradient. In the case of regular grids (which is the most common representation of a volumetric dataset), ∆ can be ignored, which leaves only the F v term and hence results in V GO = F v . In the entirety of the paper, we have used regular volume grids (voxelized volumes) and hence just consider the F v evaluation. Though we have just used the regular volume grids in this paper, in general, the VGO definition can be applied to irregular volume grids too (in this case ∆ cannot be ignored). This shows the benefit of our method over discrete Laplacian, which does not work for irregular grids. </p><formula>V GO(v 0 , v) = ∆(v 0 , v) + F v (v 0 , v) (4) </formula><p>where ∆ is the LBO and F v is the data-driven operator. We use <ref type="figure" coords="3,333.99,598.97,31.01,8.02" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>to explain F v and the half gradient. Suppose v 0 is the voxel under consideration (source) and v 1 , v 2 , v 3 , v 4 , v 5 and v 6 are the 1-ring neighboring voxels in positive x, positive y, positive z, negative x, negative y and negative z directions, respectively. Then, F v is defined by the following equation: </p><formula>F v (v 0 , v) = 1 − p * h g (v 0 , v) where v ∈ {v 1 , v 2 , v 3 , v 4 , v 5 , v 6 } (5) </formula><p>where h g is the half gradient and p is a user defined value. The effect of p on the result is explained in detail in Section 5.1. The half gradient is defined as the absolute value of the difference of the voxel intensities. As each voxel has six 1-ring neighboring voxels, six half gradients are obtained per voxel. The half gradients h g of the voxel v 0 are given by: </p><formula>h g (v 0 , v) = | I(v) − I(v 0 ) res | where v ∈ {v 1 , v 2 , v 3 , v 4 , v 5 , v 6 } (6) </formula><p>where I gives the intensity of the corresponding voxel, res is the size of the voxel which will account for the distance between the two voxels under consideration. By taking the absolute value in the half gradient computation, we are ensuring that the edge weight between two neighboring voxels (for example say V GO(v 0 , v 1 ) and V GO(v 1 , v 0 )) will be the same value. In other words, we are avoiding any conflicts while assigning the weights to the edges between the voxels. We add an additional constraint where the value of VGO is equated to 0 if it is less than 0 and equated to 1 if it exceeds 1. Thus, the VGO is defined in such a way that all the edge weights lie in the range of <ref type="bibr" coords="4,228.60,143.05,9.71,8.02">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,240.55,143.05,6.47,8.02" target="#b0"> 1]</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Equalized Histogram</head><p>When there is a low number of distinct shapes in the given volume data, a histogram of the normalized heat values would help to clearly distinguish between the different shapes and features. However, volume data is often complicated, having many objects and features with subtle differences in terms of shape, especially in medical datasets. It is impossible to capture the difference between these features using normalized histograms as the variation of the heat values is not uniform. Hence, we use an equalized histogram instead of the normalized histogram for visualization. Histogram equalization increases the global contrast inside the histogram by effectively spreading out the most frequent intensity values. The intensities are better distributed in the histogram through equalization. </p><p>(a) (b)  (b) show the difference between using the equalized histogram and the normalized histogram, respectively. <ref type="figure" coords="4,242.13,524.34,30.75,8.02" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>(a) shows many lines, each line indicating an object of specific shape and all the lines are well-distributed. However, <ref type="figure" coords="4,194.50,544.27,30.36,8.02" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>(b), which is the normalized histogram of the same heat values, shows fewer lines than <ref type="figure" coords="4,40.51,564.19,30.47,8.02" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>(a). This is because the normalized histogram does not distribute the heat values well and hence most of the features cannot be discerned using the histogram. Thus, we use the equalized histogram instead of the normalized histogram. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Histogram Analysis</head><p>The equalized heat histogram is useful to analyze the volume data at different scales. The horizontal axis of the histogram denotes the equalized heat values and the vertical axis denotes the time steps as shown in <ref type="figure" coords="4,57.59,656.72,30.35,8.02" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>(a) and these labels hold good for all the figures in the paper. The shape information obtained at different time steps is synonymous to the shape information obtained at different scales. The heat values at a particular time step incorporate the shape information of the data at that time step, or in other words, at that scale. Thus, by choosing a desired time step from the histogram the shape information at different scales is analyzed. At small number of time steps, local shape features are detected and for large number of time steps, global shape information is captured. <ref type="figure" coords="4,295.08,326.48,30.72,8.02" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>shows the result of cumulative heat diffusion at different time steps on a synthetic cube volume data. The figure shows the result for 6 different time steps, namely 20, 100, 750, 900, 1000 and 1100. For a small time step, say 20, local features such as corners and edges of the cube are detected. With increasing time steps, the heat flows gradually and captures larger features. The heat initially resides on the edges and starts moving towards the corners of the cube. This is correct as the initial heat values are determined by using the VGO which in turn involves the half gradients. As the gradient captures the local shape information, very local features are obtained initially. The heat keeps accumulating at the corners of the cube and eventually covers the entire volume. Thus, when t = 1100 the entire volume of the cube is obtained. From the results in <ref type="figure" coords="4,435.94,446.03,29.48,8.02" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>, it is interesting to observe that the rate of diffusion is slower at sharp corners or edges and is faster at flatter areas. It is clear that the rate of cumulative heat diffusion from t = 100 to t = 750 is less than the rate of cumulative heat diffusion from t = 900 to t = 1100. It has only taken around 200 time steps to capture all the faces of the cube while it has almost taken 800 time steps to capture the corners, thus emphasizing the point that the heat flow is slower at sharper areas compared to the flatter areas. This observation is very useful in determining the number of time steps required for the diffusion process in order to obtain specific features. Hence, based on the complexity, shape structure and scale of the desired features of the given data the number of time steps required to obtain the entire feature would vary. For example, pointed features would require more time steps compared to flat shaped features. <ref type="figure" coords="4,295.08,586.98,30.45,8.02" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>also shows the corresponding heat histogram obtained by carrying out the cumulative heat diffusion process for 4000 time steps on the cube data set. The respective locations of the time steps corresponding to the results shown are marked in pink lines. The area shown by the green box at the bottom of the histogram shows the initial heat values of all the voxels. Initially, all the voxels that are close to the boundary of an object (both inside and outside) have the same heat values and so all the curves merge as marked by the red box. With the increasing time, the heat flows and the heat values of all the background voxels move to the value of zero while the voxels belonging to an object have different heat values. This phenomenon can be seen on the histogram when some of the curves diverge. The background voxels eventually join the white line shown on the left border of the histogram while the voxels inside the objects converge to different lines based on their shape information. With the increasing time, we can observe from the histogram that the heat diffuses inside the volume, eventually stabilising and converging to different lines which represent different shapes identified in the dataset. For example, in <ref type="figure" coords="5,31.50,368.24,29.28,8.02" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>, we obtain a single red line shown on the right border of the histogram at t = 1100 when the entire volume of the cube is obtained. In this case, as there is only a single shaped structure, which is the cube, only one single line is obtained in the histogram. If there are several different shaped structures present in the volume, several different lines can be seen in the histogram where each line represents individual shapes as shown in <ref type="figure" coords="5,141.46,428.01,29.23,8.02" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>. The time step where the heat values for all the voxels are stabilized is chosen as an optimum time step where all the shape information can be obtained. Though the background is assigned the color white, it is rendered as transparent in the images shown in the <ref type="figure" coords="5,120.19,467.86,29.02,8.02" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>. We have used a simple synthetic cube data set of size 32x32x32 to compare the results obtained by using the conventional heat diffusion and our cumulative heat diffusion. Theoretically, the results obtained by considering all the voxels as sources simultaneously and using a single voxel as a source separately will produce the same results at steady state (i.e., for large number of time steps). The steady state result is not affected by the initialization or the evolution of the heat diffusion . The steady state result will smooth out the differences between the initialization conditions. On top of that the initial heat condition in our cumulative heat diffusion is similar to the result obtained after the first time step of the conventional heat diffusion. <ref type="figure" coords="5,488.98,428.01,30.61,8.02" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>shows the visual comparison of the identical results obtained by using the cumulative heat diffusion (bottom) and conventional heat diffusion (top) for different time steps. A noteworthy observation here is that our cumulative heat diffusion method requires fewer number of time steps than the conventional heat diffusion method to obtain identical results. <ref type="figure" coords="5,294.12,487.79,29.75,8.02" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref> shows that in order to obtain a similar result to our method using 30 time steps requires 100 time steps of the conventional method. This shows that the cumulative heat diffusion converges faster than the conventional method. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Object Classification</head><p>The cumulative heat diffusion, with the help of the heat histogram, is able to detect different objects present in the given dataset based on their shape. After a certain time, all the voxels from a single object will have similar heat values and hence will converge to a single line in the histogram. Hence, by using the histogram, the cumulative heat diffusion is used in shape-based object classification in volume data. We use the foot dataset to show the object classification using the cumulative heat diffusion. <ref type="figure" coords="5,389.89,625.82,29.99,8.02" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>shows the result of our cumulative heat diffusion on the foot data for 10 6 time steps. The rendering in <ref type="figure" coords="5,294.12,645.74,30.14,8.02" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> is based on the heat values after the last time step. The diffusion process and the heat values of the voxels for all the time steps can be visualized in the histogram. Each line in the histogram represents a shape in the foot data. Objects with similar shape have their corresponding histogram lines also close to each other. The color range is varied such that all similar shaped objects are assigned similar colors. The color of the line in the histogram is synonymous with the color of the object in the data. The distance between the lines in the heat histogram is an indication as to how similar or dissimilar each object is compared to others in terms of shape, as the difference between the heat values of similar shaped objects is very small. The lines of objects with similar shape are closer when compared to the lines of the objects that do not have similar shape. For example, in <ref type="figure" coords="6,154.69,83.27,30.40,8.02" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>we can see that the first three lines in the histogram represent three toe bones (in the middle) at the top of the foot. All three bones are more similar in shape to each other than the other bones and hence the corresponding lines in the histogram are closer. In this way, the similar objects in a volume dataset can be classified from other shapes with the aid of the heat histogram. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Shape Analysis</head><p> Cumulative heat diffusion displays lucrative properties such as invariance to scaling and orientation. We generated two synthetic data sets to establish the scale and orientation invariance of our method. The first synthetic data consists of a cube and two spheres of different sizes. The second synthetic data consists of two cubes and two cuboids with different sizes and orientation. Figures 7 (a) and (b) show the result of our cumulative heat diffusion on the first and second synthetic data respectively for 40000 time steps. In both Figures 7 (a) and (b) the rendering is based on the heat values of the voxels after the last time step. The diffusion process and the heat values of the voxels for all the time steps can be visualized in the histogram. <ref type="figure" coords="6,22.50,407.38,19.42,7.37">Fig. 7</ref> .

The corresponding lines in the histogram are close to each other identifying them as similar shape, showing invariance to scale and orientation. </p><p>The histogram in <ref type="figure" coords="6,98.69,496.73,31.04,8.02">Figure 7</ref>(a) shows that the final heat of all the voxels in the volume converges to one of the three lines indicating that there are three different objects in the given data. Of the three lines, two lines which pertain to the two green spheres are very close to each other. The line pertaining to the cube is far away from the two lines showing that the two spheres, though of different sizes, are classified as similar shape and the cube as a different shape. This shows the scale invariance of our approach. Similarly, the histogram in <ref type="figure" coords="6,31.64,576.44,30.06,8.02">Figure 7</ref>(b) shows that the final heat of all the voxels in the volume converges to one of the four lines indicating that there are four different objects in the given data. All the four lines are close to each other showing that the objects in the data are almost of similar shape. In addition, for the four lines, the distance between the left two lines (pertaining to the two blue cubes) and the distance between the right two lines (pertaining to the two purple cuboids) is smaller than the distance between the two lines in the middle. This in turn indicates that there are two distinct pairs of objects, namely a cube and a cuboid with similar shape, which is true for the given data. Despite the different dimensions and orientation, the final result correctly recognises all the shapes, thus showing that the cumulative heat diffusion is invariant to both orientation and scale. As discussed earlier, we use the normalized VGO to assign the initial heat value to all the voxels. In addition, the edge weights are also determined by the VGO. The calculation of VGO itself involves the use of the absolute value of the half gradient. This use of the absolute values in all the calculations makes sure that the cumulative heat diffusion is not affected by change in the orientation and scaling of the objects in the data. This property of our method is very useful to detect all objects with similar shape at different scales and orientations in the given volume simultaneously. All the objects with similar shape irrespective of their scale and orientation would converge to very close lines in the heat histogram. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">User Interest</head><p>The shape information we obtain does not entirely depend on the time step we consider. It also depends on how clearly the boundary is defined between different objects so that they can be clearly identified as different shapes. If the boundary between two objects or shapes is not clear then our approach will see both the objects as a single object of certain shape and the heat flow will work its way accordingly. In addition, we have also seen that sharper features take more time steps to be recognised when compared to flat surfaces as the rate of diffusion is slower at sharper areas than on the flatter areas. Choosing the boundary will also decide the amount of sharpness and smoothness in the volume data desirable by the user. Choosing clear boundaries between objects and the time step is dependent on the application and is entirely in the hands of the user. Using the histogram the user can select the time step of his choice to understand the different shape-based features present in the volume at different time steps or scales. We discussed the different results obtained by choosing different time steps in the previous sections. We will now discuss an application of our approach where the user can decide the boundary between the objects based on his requirement. <ref type="figure" coords="6,285.12,576.97,19.45,7.37">Fig. 8</ref>.

Though the features obtained in (c) </p><p>and (d) are almost similar, the features are sharper in (c) than in (d). </p><p>In our VGO definition, we used a user defined parameter, namely p. This parameter is used to decide the boundaries of the objects by the user in the given data. The VGO is a function of the half gradient and gradients work well in identifying the object boundaries and edges <ref type="bibr" coords="6,308.06,686.61,13.74,8.02" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Using the parameter p along with the half gradient in the VGO definition will give the user the extra flexibility to make a choice of the object boundaries. Hence, by changing the value of p, the user can draw a clear boundary between different objects and also decide on the level of smoothness or sharpness in the data. We leave it as a user dependent parameter so the user can choose the value based on his/her requirement. This choice of p made by the user will also affect the amount of heat flow during the cumulative heat diffusion process. Thus the results of cumulative heat diffusion might vary locally or globally for different values of p based on how well the objects are distinguished and how sharp the features are. <ref type="figure" coords="7,41.46,103.20,30.70,8.02">Figure 8</ref>shows the result of choosing different values of p on the engine dataset. Figures 8 (a), (b), (c) and (d) show the result when p = 2, 5, 10 and 15 respectively for 100 time steps. In Figures 8 (a) and </p><p>(b), there is a lot of difference in the features obtained such as those marked in blue and green. In Figures 8 (c) and (d), though the features present are almost the same, the features in <ref type="figure" coords="7,195.94,153.01,31.08,8.02">Figure 8</ref>(c) are clearer and sharper than those in <ref type="figure" coords="7,126.32,162.97,30.73,8.02">Figure 8</ref>(d).

Thus, based on what features the user wishes to focus on and what features the user wants to analyze the user can choose different values of p. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Transfer Function Design</head><p>The heat values obtained at the end of a time step will incorporate the shape information at that time step. This information can be used to design a shape-based transfer function. By choosing different time steps, the shape information obtained from the volume data at different scales can be visualized at once in the histogram, thereby aiding a volume exploration based on shape. By choosing small number of time steps, local shape can be obtained, and by choosing large number of time steps, global shape information is obtained. Thus, the heat histogram is used to design the transfer function to visualize both the local and global shape of the data. We provide a tool for the user to design a transfer function using the heat histogram. After the cumulative heat diffusion process is carried out for a large number of time steps, the corresponding heat histogram is generated using the equalized heat values obtained. The user can then choose a desired time step (vertical axis), which provides all the shape information (heat values) obtained until that time step. The user can then assign different colors and opacities to these heat values (horizontal axis), which forms a 1-D transfer function for exploring the data based on the shape information. <ref type="figure" coords="7,41.46,706.53,30.89,8.02" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref>shows the result of our shape-based transfer function on MRI head data for t = 4 × 10 5 . We were able to segment different parts of the data such as cranium (outer part), brain and eye sockets based on the shape information. <ref type="figure" coords="7,149.48,736.42,30.27,8.02" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref>(a) shows all the segmented parts of the MRI head data by using our transfer function. <ref type="figure" coords="7,513.61,53.38,30.89,8.02" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref>(b) shows just the outer cranium that covers the brain while <ref type="figure" coords="7,513.92,63.35,30.58,8.02" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref>(c) shows the brain. The cerebral fluid around the brain is captured in <ref type="figure" coords="7,294.12,83.27,30.14,8.02" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref>(d). The results of the transfer function can also be varied by varying the value of p. As the cumulative heat diffusion process is not real time, if the value of p is changed, the cumulative heat diffusion is repeated on the entire data for the required number of time steps and a new heat histogram is obtained which can then be used for transfer function design. <ref type="figure" coords="7,294.12,173.79,35.58,8.02" target="#fig_8">Figure 10</ref>shows the result of our approach on aneurysm data. The aneurysm is correctly classified into an isolated blob (yellow), the thin vessel regions (green) and a large vessel (red). All the thin vessels are tube like structures and have similar shape. Hence, the cumulative heat diffusion method classifies all the thin vessels as the same shape (tube like structures) and hence have similar color. The aneurysm (blob) in the data has a completely different shape and hence it was clearly recognised as shown in <ref type="figure" coords="7,381.29,243.53,33.56,8.02" target="#fig_8">Figure 10</ref> . It is important to note that the intention of our method is to provide a shape-based volume visualization and not to provide a reliable segmentation technique. Generally in visualization , segmentation errors do not pose a big problem and can be tolerated. Though <ref type="figure" coords="7,360.43,283.38,34.45,8.02" target="#fig_8">Figure 10</ref> provides a " weak " segmentation (the yellow color seen in the red area and the green area) all the shapes can still be clearly discerned, providing very good shape-based volume visualization. We do not propose to use our method as a reliable segmentation method or use it as a sole segmentation method. Instead, we demonstrate that our cumulative heat diffusion based volume analysis provides information about shapes, which can be exploited to build improved tools for shape-based volume visualization. The data was run for a sufficiently long time in order to capture all the shape information in the dataset. We ran the cumulative heat diffusion on the data for 10 5 time steps. <ref type="figure" coords="7,313.59,606.91,32.91,8.02" target="#fig_9">Figure 11</ref> , we show the result of our diffusion process on the visible female right hand dataset. <ref type="figure" coords="7,407.62,616.87,34.96,8.02" target="#fig_9">Figure 11</ref> (a) shows the result of considering a small number of time steps of t = 1000. Hence, we can see local shape information, which in this case provides simple yet useful information. We can observe from <ref type="figure" coords="7,420.76,646.76,34.75,8.02" target="#fig_9">Figure 11</ref> (a) that all the joints between the finger bones and the joint at the wrist have the same shape and thus the same color (red). Similarly, all the finger bones have similar stem-like shape and thus have the same color (blue). This can also be confirmed visually from the figure. The joint present at the wrist is also identified to be of similar shape as that of other joints though it is of larger size, which shows that our method successfully detects similar shaped features irrespective of size and orientation. However, we can see mixed colors of red and blue in the green box. The region inside the green box consists of two finger joints in a very small space and thus the entire region has been classified as a shape that is in between the shape of the stem-like bones and the shape of the joints. As the difference between the different shapes is very subtle in this region, the colors have been mixed. <ref type="figure" coords="8,154.54,446.28,34.87,8.02" target="#fig_9">Figure 11</ref>(b) shows the result of considering a large (steady) number of time steps of t = 10 6 . At this steady state time, all the global shape information is obtained. In this case, we can observe that it has been classified into three parts, namely the bone (white), the skin (blue) and the area on which the hand rests (red). These results show the power of our method in utilising both the local and the global shape information for visualizing similar features and objects in otherwise complex volumes. A comparison in terms of the running times by using our approach and directly using the conventional heat diffusion on different volume datasets is given in <ref type="figure" coords="8,94.13,545.91,25.74,8.02">Table 1</ref>. The third column of the table shows the number of iterations (time steps) for which the cumulative diffusion process was carried out. The fourth column shows the value of p used for the datasets. The fifth column gives the time taken per iteration by the conventional heat diffusion (HD in <ref type="figure" coords="8,182.01,585.76,26.83,8.02">Table 1</ref> ) process on volumes (we run the HD for only 1 iteration to get the time) while the last column gives the time taken per iteration by our approach of using cumulative heat diffusion (CHD in <ref type="figure" coords="8,165.42,615.64,26.10,8.02">Table 1</ref>) on volumes. We can clearly see that in all the cases, for the same number of iterations, the time taken for the cumulative heat diffusion process is smaller than the conventional heat diffusion by a very large factor, thus showing that our method reduces the computational time drastically. All tests were conducted on a system equipped with an Intel Xeon E5620 CPU and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 480 graphics board. </p><formula>(a) (b) (c) (d) </formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p> The main contribution of this paper is the shape-based volume analysis method using a simplistic approach of Cumulative Heat Diffusion. We have introduced a method that captures the shape information in volumetric data directly and at the same time is an order of magnitude faster than the conventional heat diffusion. Unlike conventional heat diffusion, where the diffusion process is repeated by considering each of the voxels as sources separately, in our approach all the voxels are considered as sources simultaneously and the diffusion is carried out. We have also introduced a new operator called the VGO, which determines the heat flow in the cumulative heat diffusion. VGO is used to determine the edge weights between the voxels and these edge weights monitor the amount of heat flow between two voxels. In addition, VGO is also used to assign the initial heat values to all the voxels. The final heat values of the voxels capture the shape information and are visualized using an equalized histogram. We also discuss the properties and applications of our method by presenting results using simple as well as complicated datasets. Our future work focuses on finding a way to automatically decide the optimum p and optimum time step t to obtain the best results instead of the user choosing it. As of now, we use the heat histogram as an aid to select the optimum value of the time step at which the best results are obtained. We are also planning to explore better ways to visualize the heat values. For now, we are using an equalized histogram to visualize the heat values of the voxels. The equalized histogram better distributes the intensities on the histogram and due to this even the heat values which are very close can also be distinguished. However, when the level of complexity of the volume data increases, the number of objects with different shape also increases. In that case, the subtle variations of heat between the different objects is not captured well by the equalized histogram as shown in <ref type="figure" coords="8,417.38,434.40,34.62,8.02" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref>of the bonsai dataset. <ref type="figure" coords="8,304.63,626.04,32.96,8.02" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref>, we can see that the histogram is cluttered (enclosed in white ellipse) with many lines. Each of the lines corresponds to one or many of the leaves of the bonsai tree. Due to this clutter, the leaves of the bonsai cannot be classified perfectly. We wish to widen the scope of application of our method to fields where the shape is ill-defined, such as flow simulation and also to focus on other diffusion methods such as the watershed methods. </p></div>
