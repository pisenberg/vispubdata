				<p>In this paper we show how SAVS, a tool for visualization and data analysis in space and atmospheric science, can be used to quickly and easily address problems that would previously have been far more laborious to solve. Based on the popular AVS package, SAVS presents the user with an environment tailored specifically for the physical scientist. Thus there is minimal &quot;startup&quot; time, and the scientist can immediately concentrate on his science problem. The SAVS concept readily generalizes to many otherfields of science and engineering.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p>Space and atmospheric scientists have long been faced with huge, continually growing repositories of data from decades of spacecraft missions. The quantities of information involved are so enormous that traditional methods for data analysis and assimilation would quickly be overwhelmed. This situation is made all the more critical by unprecedented volumes of new data from modem, high-bandwidth experiments and by the widespread use of empirical and large-scale computational methods for the synthesis of understanding across datasets and discipline boundaries. A new approach is clearly necessary.</p><p>We are attempting to address this problem with SAVS (a Space and Atmospheric Visualization Science system). SAVS is a unique "pushbutton" environment that mimics the logical scientific process in data acquisi-tion, reduction, and analysis without requiring a detailed understandmg of the underlying software components; in effect, SAVS gives the physical scientist access to highlevel functionality, tadored to his particular needs, without requiring him to become a computer scientist as well <ref type="bibr">[ 11. SAVS provides</ref> (1) a customizable framework for accessing a powerful set of visualization tools, based on the popular AVS package, with hooks to PV-Wave and Khoros; (2) a set of mathematical and statistical analysis tools; (3) an extensible library of disciplinespecific functions and models (providing, for example, satellite tracks and ionospheric parameters); and (4) capabilities for local and remote database access, including search, browse, and acquire functions.</p><p>We begin this paper with a brief description of the SAVS architecture, its components, and its implementation; the focus is on the integration of visualization with mathematical and statistical models, advanced database techniques, and user interfaces for enabling enhanced acquisition, analysis, comparison, and understanding of both observational and computational data. Through the use of examples taken from current research in space science, we then demonstrate the applicability of the SAVS concept, with emphasis on the benefits of using an integrated visualization/data analysis tool. Finally, we touch upon future directions for SAVS, paying particular attention to the extension of the SAVS paradigm beyond space and atmospheric science to other fields of science and engineering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visualization and methods</head><p>The SAVS architecture recognizes that scientists and mission design engineers work routinely with data, theoretical models, and orbits (including orbital parameters, payload configuration, instrument fields-of-view, coordinated ground stations, etc.). At any given time they may work exclusively with one item, or with combinations of all three. The most likely scenario involves an interactive, iterative combination of the three, filtered through a mathematical interpreter and displayed through a broad set of visualization tools. SAVS is a "pushbutton" environment that mimics the thought processes of the scientist in data acquisition, reduction, and analysis. As such, SAVS has three entry concourses for daily activities: dura, models, and eqerimenr envelope. By selecting one of these entry points in the SAVS front end, the scientist begins a procedure utilizing SAVS-guided functionality to exercise an unlimited number of loops in any given concourse or across concourses. The scientist can treat and overlay multiple model runs or datasets, and visualize the results in any number of formats.</p><p>SAVS is based on the AVS visualization system, and also makes use of numerous other modules and packages, both custom-written and public domain, to enable its distributed database access, physical modeling, mathematical, and statistical functionality. It supports a wide variety of standard data formats (HDF, CDF, netCDF, etc.), and provides a well-documented set of "hooks" so that users can easily include readers for other formats. The key point, for purposes of this paper, is that the familiar AVS user interface (most notably the network editor and its associated module libraries) is usually hidden from the average SAVS user. Instead, the SAVS interface gives the user "pushbutton" entries into the three concourses described above, providing instant access to the wide variety of database, modeling, analysis, and visualization functions supported by the system. No knowledge of the methods, modules, and networks that actually execute these functions is required. Thus SAVS is immediately accessible and useful to the scientist.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Examples and discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mission planning</head><p>We demonstrate the interactivity and extensibility of the SAVS concept with an application scenario that can be considered generic to any mission planning exercise, or indeed to any activity involving data reduction and analysis that requires (1) a number of models; (2) ground-based and spaceborne data; (3) in situ and remote sensing techniques; (4) perspectives on fluxtube-coupled domains; and (5) co-registration of satellite-bome and ground-based diagnostics.</p><p>A typical mission scenario is presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. This scenario has counterparts in several current NASA missions (e.g., CRRES, TIMED, ISTP) requiring the coordination of satellite passes with ground-based optical, ionosonde, and radar diagnostics. The SAVS models concourse was used to generate the object in <ref type="figure">Figure  l</ref> a by overlaying (1) thermospheric winds (blue vectors) and oxygen densities (global color-coded surface) at 350 km using the WIND and MSIS library models; (2) auroral oval boundanes from the Feldstein library model;</p><p>(3) altitude cut-planes of ionospheric densities from the IRI library model, in the latitudinal and longitudinal planes intersecting the coordinates of the Arecibo Observatory; and (4) geomagnetic field lines (in white) from the IGRF library model. The satellite trajectory was generated in the experiment envelope concourse using the CADRE-3 library model.</p><p>With button and dial controls, the user can (1) adjust the auroral oval for any magnetic activity index or Universal Time; (2) change the heights of the thermospheric wind and density calculations; (3) vary the activity index Ap, the solar F10.7 flux, and the day-of-year input drivers for WIND and MSIS; (4) alter the year for the IGRF; (5) tune the month and sunspot number for the IRI; and (6) change the coordinates for the intersecting cut-planes (with interest, for example, in high latitude passes in conjunction with Sondrestrom radar operations in Greenland). The cut-planes could also be in the magnetic E-W and N-S directions instead of being aligned with the geographic contours of latitude and longitude at the Arecibo Observatory.</p><p>From the CADRE-3 orbit specifications the user can develop stack plots of any number of relevant parameters as a function of UT, latitude, longitude, MET, or LT. These parameters include SZA, MLAT, MLONG, MLT, L-shell value, point of conjugacy, spacecraft velocity vector relative to the ambient magnetic field, height of the terminator relative to the satellite track, magnetic field values or values of its E-W or N-S components, and so on.</p><p>The user can also call up a 3D-to-1D module to interpolate model results along any segment of the satellite track. Through the dura concourse, he can then compare the results with local or remote databases of along-track measurements.</p><p>For co-registration with ground-based diagnostics, <ref type="figure">Figure l</ref> b presents a zoomed-in perspective on the Arecibo site, including the projection of the groundbased HF radar beam up to an altitude of 400 km. That projection is developed and displayed with the SAVS "field-of-view'' module, controllable by the user to <ref type="figure">(See color plates, page CP-37.)</ref> represent any ground-based remote sensing diagnostics. The user need only input the coordinates of the ground site, the azimuth and elevation of the instrument's lineof-sight, and its beam width (or acceptance) half angles in the N-S and E-W directions.</p><p>Inspection of <ref type="figure">Figure l b</ref> shows that the satellite (the black sphere) at the given UT in its trajectory in not on a field line that connects to the region diagnosed by the ground-based radar. With animation and pause controls, the user can determine the exact time of the field line coupling and begin a number of SAVS-controlled operations. For example, the 3D-to-1D module can be used to interpolate ionospheric and thermospheric model densities, temperatures, and composition onto the connecting field line, and the model data used as input to calculate fluxtube-integrated conductivities from the satellite to the region covered by the ground-based diagnostics. The module could also be used to calculate integrated densities or emissions along the field-of-view of the ground-based sensor. The field-of-view module can in turn be "attached to the spacecraft to project and visuahze the field-of-view of an on-board remote sensing device. In this case the animation and-visualization products could focus on the determination of the time of intersection of the fields-of-view of the satellite and ground-based sensors.</p><p>The scenarios are unlimited. Models can be tuned and retuned, and results visualized in simple stack plots of along-track correlations for comparisons with data. Visualizations can include constant altitude surfaces of any geophysical parameters; alternately, the user can choose altitude cut-planes, isosurfaces, or isocontours. The "proper" visualization product is only determined by the perceptive and inquisitive scientific mind, with the freedom of the "pushbutton" operation of the SAVS system malung the choices immediately available. One can only imagine how difficult this process would be without visualization tools (for example, requiring a mathematical analysis to determine the intersection of a particular flux tube with the field-of-view of a ground-based sensor), or if the scientist was required to become an AVS expert before he could analyze his mission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental analysis</head><p>As another example of the importance to the scientist of easily-accessible visualization and analysis tools, we consider a situation where the visualization products are not representations of data and model runs. Rather, they provide tests of model or algorithmic integrity and time saving views of an experimental scenario that facilitate determination of the shortest path in the process of data reduction and analysis. This is illustrated in a SAVS application to a rocket-borne chemical release experiment in the NASA CRRES program that involved in situ and ground-based systems and aspects of coupled phenomena along geomagnetic field lines. <ref type="figure">Figure 2a</ref> shows a rocket trajectory along with an array of magnetic field vectors determined by the IGRF library model. The obvious discontinuity in the magnetic field representation immediately revealed a subtle problem in an interpolation module that might have gone undetected without this simple visual aid. <ref type="figure">Figure 2b</ref> illustrates the application of SAVS visualization tools to help understand the actual configuration of the experiment. In the simplest description of the experiment scenario, a BaLi mixture in a sealed canister was separated from the rocket's diagnostics payload, and the vaporized gases were released on the upleg portion of the trajectory at an altitude near 180 km. The colored disk in the panel is a color-coded model depiction of the clouds ion density in the plane perpendicular to the clouds bulk velocity at a very early phase of the expansion process. The red line is the suborbital trajectory, and the long and short vectors are the magnetic field and payload velocities at the point of the release. The cone-shaped object is the projection of a ground-based HF heater beam intended to intercept the chemical cloud at its ionospheric altitude, excite the electrons, and induce enhanced optical emissions and plasma instability processes.</p><p>The initial process of understanding the actual configuration of the experiment involved the following questions: (1) What were the magnitude and directions of the cloud's bulk velocity relative to the geomagnetic field? (2) How well was the chemical release coupled along the magnetic field to the diagnostic payload? (3) How effectively did the heater beam intercept the cloud? (4) Was it possible to observe expanding cloud ions on the downleg portion of the trajectory?</p><p>The first three questions were answered using the rotation and zooming tools in SAVS, with some of the image products presented in <ref type="figure">Figures 2c and 2d</ref>. The last question was answered with yet another rotation that projected an image perpendicular to the plane of the trajectory, with the downleg portion of the trajectory in the foreground. That image, presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 2c</ref>, shows that the magnetic field at the release site did indeed intersect the downleg trajectory. A simple hand scaling of altitude and range showed that the flux tube passing through the release missed the downleg trajectory by 13 km, however, a sufficiently great distance to minimize interest in searching the data for possible late-time ion signatures of the expansion process on the downleg trajectory.</p><p>The entire exercise of answering the questions listed above required less than five minutes with SAVS. Without the visualization tools, the answers would have <ref type="figure">(See color plates, page CP-37.1</ref> required the development of a number of mathematical algorithms and a sequence of stack plots. That exercise could have taken several days. Once again, we see that visualization is a time saving and insightful element in the process of data reduction and analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The future</head><p>The SAVS concept is designed for broad appeal and functionality, since its architecture accommodates a general scientific approach to data access, manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Every scientific discipline deals with data, either in scalar, vector, or image fonnat.</p><p>Every discipline needs to develop, test, and apply empirical and first principle model descriptions of cause-effect relationships. Every science needs to deal with the spatial and temporal coordinates of datasets (generally represented by a satellite's orbital elements, payload configuration, and instrument fields-of-view in a space science application). And finally, every scientific discipline requires a suite of mathematical and statistical tools to handle data and prepare it for visualization. This is the generic system capability of SAVS, making it applicable to virtually any scientific discipline.</p><p>For a system such as SAVS to reach its full potential there is the intrinsic need for scientists to open their minds to the broad spectrum of capabilities embedded in the visualization tools available today. Unfortunately, many scientists have been conditioned to regard data and model outputs as entities with inviolate properties that dictate the use of traditional analysis techniques. This attitude must be abandoned for the full potential of visualization to be realized. Visualization is a rapidly developing field that holds great promise. But like any resource, it must be effectively mined and made accessible to its potential constituency.</p></div>		</body>
