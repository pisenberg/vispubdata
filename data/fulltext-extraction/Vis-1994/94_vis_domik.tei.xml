				<p>Meaningful scient@ visualizations benefit the interpretation of scientijic data, concepts and processes. To ensure nleaningful visualizations, the visualization system needs to adapt to desires, disabilities and abilities of the user, interpretation aim, resources (hardware, sofrware) available, and the form and content of the data to be visualized. We suggest to describe these characteristics by four models: user model, problem donlaidtask model, resource model and data model. This paper makes suggestions for the generation of a user model as a basis for an adaptive visualization system. We propose to extract informtion about the user by involving the user in interactive computer tests and gantes. Relevant abilities tested are color perception, color rnemory, color ranking, mental rotation, and fine nwtor coordination.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The transformation of physical phenomena (denoted as "Reality" in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>) into computer readable numbers is a prerequisite to computer visualization <ref type="bibr">([ 13)</ref>. Visualization denotes the actual process of mapping numbers to pictures. The viewer's interpretation of a picture is the final stage of visualization. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> distinguishes between two goals of visualization: gaining new insight into the numbers represented in the picture (e.g. interpreting the quality of a computer model representing a physical phenomena) or gaining a better understanding of the real phenomena itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Gutkauf</head><p>University of Colorado Boulder, CO. 80309-0430, USA gutkauf @ cs.colorado.edu</p><p>Meaningful computer visualizations benefit the interpretation of (scientific) data, concepts and processes. Qualitative measurements for the meaningfulness of pictures have been defined as "expressive" and "effective" by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Such systems are also called "graphically articulate" <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Often a trial-and-error approach leads to finding the most expressive and effective (graphically articulate) visualizations. Ineffective, inexpressive (graphically inarticulate) computer visualization is at best useless and at worst misleading. However, the value of a picture for the purpose of a particular interpretation is often not obvious to the viewer before its use for interpretation. The same picture might bring about new insights to one user, but not to another; the same picture might be effective for one scientific problem, but not for another; the same animation might be adequate to understand a problem on one type of hardware, but not on another. In order to generate the most meaningful picture for a specific instance, a careful mapping process from "numbers to pictures" is necessary. The next section discusses the factors influencing the quality of a visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Factors influencing the quality of visualizations: data, user, task, problem domain and resources</head><p>Past scientific visualization literature, e.g. 141, [51, <ref type="bibr">[61, 171, 181, [9]</ref>, indicate the need for a careful mapping process from numerical data to visual attributes of a picture. A meaningful visualization must fit syn- tax and semantics of the numerical data values to be represented, support the interpretation aim (task), conform to the problem domain, adapt to the user as well as be adequately supported by available computer resources. Large scientific institutions, e.g. the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), have in the past provided visualization experts to aid scientists with the mapping process on an individual basis. Visualization experts collect all background information necessary to generate meaningful pictures before starting the actual visualization process, therefore minimizing trial-and-error time. In lieu of help from a visualization expert, the visualization system itself should be "knowledgeable" about background information. We suggest to formally describe the knowledge of the system by four models: user model, data model, resource model, and problem domain/task model. The more knowledge the visualization system possesses about user, data, resources and problem domain/task, the better it can adapt to one specific visualization instance. Lack of knowledge in any of the above named areas will lead to a trial-and-error approach in finding meaningful visualizations, or in the worst case, will result in misleading visualizations. We call visualization systems that are able to conform to a specific visualization instance "adaptive visualization systems". Adaptive visualization systems belong to a new class of "intelligent visualization systems".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Data model</head><p>The "data model" serves to organize information in the numbers to be visually represented. The potential of visual indicators in a picture to express information as well as artifacts is dependent on syntactic and semantic characteristics of these numbers, such as dynamic range, data type, dimensions, structures and dependencies.</p><p>The need for data models to organize complex data sets for visualization has recently been recognized, e.g.</p><p>[lo], <ref type="bibr">[ll]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. However, the use of data models for adaptive or intelligent visualization systems is still rare. Mickus-Miceli <ref type="bibr">([ 151)</ref> suggests the use of an object-oriented data model to model both the structural and behavioral components of the data as a basis for an intelligent visualization system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Resource model</head><p>The "Resource model" identifies the hardware and software environment a user works in. It should contain information on the display hardware, input and output devices, processors, special graphics extensions, as well as software modules available, and any other factors influencing capabilities and limitations of the computer. If relevant, this also includes lightening of the room the user works in, or other factors influencing the performance of the system without actually being part of the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Problem domaidtask model</head><p>Certain problem domains prefer specific pictorial representations. Often this preference is rooted in uadition, and emphasized through education. Sometimes the use of particular visual cues seems "common sense", such as the use of blue for lower elevations (in particular for water), or for cold temperatures. However, if the objects to be represented are abstract, artificial color mapping is established. In electrical engineering, positive charges are encoded in red and negative charges in blue or black. While such color mapping is not "common sense", it is taught in schools universally throughout the world, and becomes "common sense" for electrical engineers.</p><p>In a similar way, different interpretation aims (such as "locating", "visually correlate", or "identify") demand different visual expressions for quick and accurate interpretation. While problem domain and interpretation aim are very different factors influencing the quality of visualizations, we here suggest the use of one model to represent information on both. This has no deeper purpose than to minimize the number of models in an adaptive visualization system.</p><p>The fourth model, the user model, is described in more detail in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">User model</head><p>The "user model" describes the collective information the system has of a particular user (viewer). A picture is subjectively interpreted by the viewer in dependency of past experiences, education, gender, culture, and individual limitations, abilities and requirements. E.g., color deficient viewers are limited in interpreting color pictures; a person with deficient fine motor skills will have problems accurately pointing at small objects on the screen. In order to create a user model, the system needs to learn facts about the user. Most of these facts can be extracted from observing the user performing special tasks. In the following sections we will describe the generation of a user model in more detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">User modeling</head><p>the five abilities (color ranking and color memory) the test results are described in a qualitative manner. User modeling denotes the generation of the user model by extracting information from the user <ref type="bibr">([16]</ref>). Information can be extracted from the user in one of three ways: a) Through explicit modeling: the user typically fills out a form and answers to direct questions. b) Through implicit modeling: the user is being observed in hidher use of the system. c) The user is asked to solve special tasks and is being observed in doing so.</p><p>A complete user model evolves in several stages, whereby each style of user modeling is being used.</p><p>Typically, the extraction of information starts with explicit modeling to inquire about gender, age, or education. Subsequently, the user has to complete special tasks that reveal limitations of hidher vision and/or hand-eye coordination. By continuously observing the user in hisher use of the visualization system, the user model can be improved over time. Significant information for the user model is expected from the completion of special tasks. We have therefore focused on implementing special tests that reveal abilities and disabilities of the user. Most of the tests are currently implemented at the motivational level of educational games: users enjoy performing the tests and may call them up repeatedly. Motivation in performing these tests is important both for Ihe purpose of user modeling as well as for training certain abilities through repetitive performance of the tests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Parameters of the user model</head><p>The following five abilities describing the performance of a user as relevant for visualization have been investigated in more detail: color perception, color memory, color ranking, mental rotation, and fine motor coordination. Additionally we have found several abilities that might be of influence, but have not been investigated in any detail so far: reasoning, size recognition, perceptual speed, visual versus verbal recognition, and embedded figure recognition.</p><p>Following is a description of each of the five user abilities investigated, explaining its relationship to visualization and the special tasks which extract information about this ability from the user. Between fifteen and twenty users were tested for each of the abilities. In three of the five abilities (perception, mental rotation, fine motor coordination) we were able to derive quantitative evaluations of the results. In two of Color perception: Color perception is defined as the process of distinguishing points or homogeneous patches of light by a subject. It is a cognitive ability and varies among people. Color perception depends on a person's color deficiency, gender, ethnological information, quality of monitor used and the lightening situation in the room. No general assumption of color perception for one visualization instance can therefore be made a priori.</p><p>Since color graphics workstations have become a standard equipment at scientific institutions, color coding is one of the most commonly used visualization techniques to represent data. Colors used must be set to values that are easily distinguished by the viewer. Therefore the goal for the "color perception test" is to find a set of discriminatory colors. A standardized test optometrists use to determine color deficiencies, the "Farnsworth Hue loo" test ([17]), has been used as a basis. In a very similar manner, the essence of our test is to sort forty pastel (low saturation) color chips so that every chip has a minimal color difference to its neighbor. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> (upper row) shows the arrangement of color chips at the start of the test, <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> (lower row) shows the correct result after rearranging the chips. In order to use perceptually similar leaps between the forty color chips, the CIELUV color space ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>) is used. Colors that can not be distinguished would appear out of order in the test results. We use only forty colors instead of one hundred or more to keep the user motivated to perform the test. Our first results indicate that these forty colors give us enough information to eliminate colors that would cause problems for color coding.</p><p>For twenty users two parameters each were measured: a) the time it took the user to perform the color perception test, and b) an error factor describing the errors in the final arrangement of the color chips. In order to compare measured time between slow and quick users, we used the time difference between the actual timing measurement of the color perception test and similar tasks (e.g. sorting numbers, sorting angles). A value of zero on the time difference axis in Color ranking: Color ranking is the association of color with ordinal or quantitative data items. If a temperature scale is to be displayed, standard color mapping (low temperature mapped to blue, high temperatures mapped to red, yellow and white) may be used. If no "standard mapping" is known for specific data characteristics, an artificial ranking of colors from "low" to "high" is necessary. Because human perception has no inherent ranking of colors, the association of color with ordinal or quantitative data items is individual, depending on the problem domain as well as the viewer's education, color deficiencies and preference.</p><p>Interpreting the meaning of a color picture often involves instant recognition of low values versus high values. The presence of a color scale showing the used  color range and its associations is extremely important. Still, misinterpretation can only be avoided, if the viewer is in agreement with the association. The goal of the "color ranking test" is therefore to have the viewer reveal their own intuition on color sequences. This is done by having the user match colors of an available color gamut (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4)</ref> to a number scale from one to ten. Typical color scales expected from this test were: <ref type="figure">(See color plates, page CP-24.)</ref> black (0)purplebluecyandark-greenlightgreenyelloworangeredwhite (10) or black(0)purplebluecyandark-greenlightgreenredorangeyellowwhite <ref type="formula">10</ref>Results from the color ranking test proved very individual. Even though spectral scales and increasing perceptual brightness were among the fifteen test results, most users lacked a specific strategy. We are currently devising the test to receive more meaningful results. The user chosen color scale should be used preferably for visualization of ordinal data items.</p><p>Color memory: Color memory is the ability of a person to recall a color from memory. Even though we are able to distinguish between numerous colors [19]), we can only do so when comparing one color to another. If color samples are not directly compared to each other we can only process a small fraction of colors (around ten). Interpreting the meaning of a color picture series often involves recognizing (and therefore remembering) the Same color in several pictures. Specifically for the distinction of nominal data items, we prefer to use colors the user can easily distinguish.</p><p>The idea for the corresponding "color memory" test has been borrowed from the well known game "Memory". Nine color cards ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>) are shown to the user for ten seconds. When they are turned facedown, the user needs to pick the correct color corresponding to one color card that will be shown to hidher. The user may guess as many times as needed, but the amount of guesses is entered in a log file. The game can vary in difficulty by changing the timing allowed to view the nine cards. As in all other tests and games introduced in this paper, the results (what colors are memorized best) are not only dependent on user's abilities but also on the quality of hardware and lightning environment. For our purposes we see this as an advantage of modeling the current environment as perfectly as possible rather than a lack of separation between the content of different visualization models (e.g. user model and resource model).</p><p>Mental rotation: Mental rotation is the ability to rotate mental representations of two and three dimensional objects. The response time required by degree of rotation is called "mental rotation rate". Determination of the mental rotation rate is used to study the speed of spatial information processing and as such part of intelligence/ability tests.</p><p>One of the most interesting and pioneering re-search areas in visualization today is the use of glyphs to represent multi-variate data (e.g. <ref type="bibr">[203, [211, [221, [23]</ref>). In some cases, rotation of glyphs (in two or three dimensions) denote changes of variables. In order to interpret rotated glyphs, mental rotation needs to be applied.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref> are divided into four quadrants: quadrant I shows users that are both fast and accurate in their mental rotation ability; quadrant IV shows users that are both slow and error prone. The divisions between the quadrants are established by the mean values over all users. For users inside quadrant IV, interpretation of glyphs that encode rotation should be avoided.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fine motor coordination:</head><p>Fine motor coordination is the user's ability to perform precision manual tasks, demanding good eye-hand coordination and motor speed. This ability is influenced by age, gender, experience, motor (dis)abilities of the user as well as the input device used. With increasing age the ability to coordinate the interaction between eye and hand de- creases <ref type="bibr">([251)</ref>. While in general men are faster in tapping a single key, women are faster in moving small objects to a specific destination. Players of computer games are an excellent example to show the increase of fine motor coordination with experience. Naturally, motor disabilities impair fine motor coordination. Additionally to these individual characteristics of a user, type and quality of the input device used plays a large role in the accuracy of fine motor coordination.</p><p>Interactive visualization requires fine motor coordination, e.g. to point at small objects or to trace structures on the screen. The "fine motor coordination test" as currently implemented determines the user's speed and error rate to trace a predefined path (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>).</p><p>Error rate, as an indicator for accuracy, is measured by counting the number of times the user leaves the predefined path (green path in <ref type="figure">Figure 7)</ref>. Ability tests and their implementation are explained in full detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. We are planning the following improvements for the future:</p><p>Several additional user abilities, such as reasoning, size recognition, perceptual speed, visual versus verbal recognition, and embedded figure recognition, seem to be of importance but their ability tests have not been designed yet. Additionally, the user's knowledge about visualization should influence the use of visual representations. Some of the implemented ability tests need to be extended: The mental rotation test is specifically developed for three dimensional objects, however, a 2- The result of fifteen test users in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> compares time and error rate: as in the previous user test, the quadrants are separated by the mean error rate and mean user's speed, respectively. Quadrant I describes the best candidates for a quick and accurate access via mouse. Quadrant IV describes users with a certain handicap for these tasks. Initial tests showed, that the type of pointing device used was a major influence to the results. In order to observe differences in the user's ability alone, the same mouse was used for all tests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Outlook</head><p>Meaningful visualizations have often been created through trial-and-error in the past. The generation of a priori meaningful visualizations will effectively increase scientific productivity. Such visualizations can be supported by adapting visual representations to the dimensional rotation test would also seem of importance. The fine motor coordination test is specifically developed to test the user's abilities with a mouse; alternative tests to determine strengths/weaknesses of other input devices should be developed. While the results of our ability tests are well understood, they have not been implemented yet into a visualization system, which will be an important step for the future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The essence of visualization is a mapping process from numbers to pictures.</figDesc></figure>
