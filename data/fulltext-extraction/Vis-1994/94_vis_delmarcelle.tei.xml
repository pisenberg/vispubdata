				<p>We study the topology of symmetric, second-order tensor fields. The goal is to represent their complex structure by a simple set of carefully chosen points and lines analogous to vector field topology. We extract topological skeletons of the eigenvector fields, and we track their evolution over time. We study tensor topological transitions and correlate tensor and vector data. The basic constituents of tensor topology are the degenerate points, or points where eigenvalues are equal to each other. Degenerate points play a similar role as critical points in vector fields. We identify two kinds of elementary degenerate points, which we call wedges and trisectors. They can combine to form more familiar singularities-such as saddles, nodes, centers, or foci. However, these are generally unstable structures in tensor fields. Finally, we show a topological rule that puts a constraint on the topology of tensor fields defined across surfaces, extending to tensor fields the PoincarC-Hopf theorem for vector fields.</p>

In fluid flows, for example, velocity, vorticity, and temperature gradients are vector fields. Stresses, viscous stresses, rateof-strain, and momentum flux density are symmetric tensor fields.</p><p>Both vector and tensor fields are multivariate; they involve more than one piece of information at every point of space. In fact, vector and symmetric tensor fields in N dimensional space embody as much information as N and i N ( N + 1) independent scalar fields, respectively! Visualizing such data is a difficult challenge, mainly because of the necessity of rendering the underlying continuity while avoiding problems of visual clutter. (See for example Reference [l] for a unified expos6 of vector and tensor visualization techniques.)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The topology of a tensor field T ( T ) is the topology of its eigenvector fields Ti(?).</head><p>As with regular vector fields, we seek topological skeletons that provide simple depictions of the structure of the eigenvector fields. We obtain these skeletons by locating degenerate points (Section 2) and integrating the set of their connecting hyperstreamline trajectories (Section 3). Due to their sign indeterminacy, eigenvectors have a different structure from regular, signed vector fields. For example, we show a tensor topological rule constraining the structure of tensor fields defined across surfaces (Section 4). Finally, we discuss succinct extensions of our theory to 3-D and to unsymmetric tensor data (Section 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Degenerate Points</head><p>We build a topological analysis of tensor fields from the concept of degenerate points, which play the role of critical points in vector fields.</p><p>Streamlines in vector fields never cross each other except at critical points and, as we show below, hyperstreamlines in tensor fields meet each other only a t degenerate points. Similar to critical points, degenerate points are the basic singularities underlying the topology of tensor fields. We define them mathematically as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 1 (Degenerate point)</head><p>A point TO is a degenerate point of the tensor field T(T) if7 the two eigenvalues ofT(F) are equal to each other at Eo-i.e., Let us denote by X the common eigenvalue at the degenerate point fo. At TO, the tensor field is proportional to the identity matrix: 2 8 Xl(T0) = X2(To).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T(: o) = ( ; )</head><p>which implies that T(To)F = XE for every vector F. At most points, there is only one eigenvector associated with each eigenvalue but, at degenerate points, there are an infinity of such eigenvectors. So hyperstreamlines cross each other a t degenerate points.</p><p>Degenerate points satisfy the following conditions:'</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">T I I (~, ) -Tzz(T0) = 0<label>(3)</label></formula><p>{ TlZ(C0) = 0 which we use to locate them. When the data are defined on a discrete grid, we use bilinear interpolation of the tensor components between vertices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Index, sectors, and separatrices</head><p>In vector fields there are various types of critical points-such as nodes, foci, centers, and saddle points-that correspond to different local patterns of the neighboring streamlines. These patterns are characterized by the vector gradients at the positions of the critical points <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Likewise in tensor fields, different types of degenerate points occur that correspond to different local patterns of the neighboring hyperstreamlines. These patterns are determined by the tensor gradients at the positions of the degenerate points.</p><p>Consider the partial derivatives evaluated at the degenerate point CO. In the vicinity of fo, we can expand tensor components to first-order a s While indices at critical points of continuous vector fields must be integer quantities (1 for a node, -1 for a saddle, etc.), indices at degenerate points of continuous tensor fields are half-integers. This arises from the sign ambiguity of the eigenvectors. In fact, we show in</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Reference [7] that, i f 6 # 0, the index I at ; i ' o is given 6 = a d -b c (6) 1 1 2 2 I = -sign(6) = f-<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Valid in any coordinate system. For example, the singularity in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> has three hyperbolic and three parabolic sectors. By analogy with vector fields, we call "separatrices" the dividing hyperstreamlines that separate one sector from the next, such as s1 to S6 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Let e k be the angle between the separatrix s k and the x-axis. We show in Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> that xk = t a n &amp; must be a root of the cubic equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">dx3 + (c + 2b)x' + (2a -d)x -c = o<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Thus, there are a t maximum three separatrices (real roots xk) and degenerate points have no more than three sectors.</p><p>Consider a hypothetical singularity with np parabolic and nh hyperbolic sectors (nP +nh 5 3).

See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 3</ref> for a schematic depiction.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Merging degenerate points</head><p>Wedges and trisectors are stable structures in continuous tensor fields; they can not be broken into more elementary singularities with smaller index. In timedependent flows, however, they move and can merge with each other, creating combined singularities of higher index.</p><p>A combination of degenerate points looks in the far field as a singularity whose index is the sum of the indices of its constituent parts. The following pattern, for example, The merging of wedges and trisectors corresponds to 6 = 0. A more quantitative study of the patterns in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> is difficult since it requires developing tensor components a t least to second order in Equations 5.</p><p>As opposed to critical points in vector fields, degenerate points with integral indices are usually unstable. They split into elementary wedges or trisectors soon after their creation by merging. They are nevertheless important for the study of instantaneous topologies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Tensor Field Topology</head><p>We build on the theory of degenerate points to extract the topology of tensor fields and to study topological transitions.</p><p>The technique is similar to vector field topology with degenerate points playing the role of critical points. We represent each eigenvector field by a topological skeleton obtained by locating degenerate points and integrating the set of their connecting separatrices. We illustrate these concepts by visualizing the topology of the stress tensor in a 2-D periodic flow past a cylinder.</p><p>Fluid elements undergo compressive stresses while moving with the flow. Stresses are described mathematically by the stress tensor, which combines isotropic pressure and anisotropic viscous stresses. Both eigenvalues of the stress tensor are negative, and the two orthogonal eigenvectors, 5 1 and ij2 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Equation 2)</ref>, are along the least and the most compressive directions, respectively. At a degenerate point, the viscous stresses vanish and both eigenvalues are equal to the pressure; degenerate points are points of pure pressure.</p><p>The texture in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 7</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Tracking degenerate points</head><p>The instantaneous representation in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 7</ref> contains valuable information but we can learn more about the spatiotemporal structure of the tensor field by tracking the motion of degenerate points over time. In some instances, pair creations affect only the local flow; the two newly created points move together and eventually disappear by merging. Two C-events, however, are different; the newly created points move far away from each other, inducing a topological transition in the tensor field. These new wedge-trisector pairs are created periodically in a location alternatively above then below the cylinder symmetry axis. New wedge points are quickly dragged into the wake about the cylinder axis while new trisectors move downstream away from the axis. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Correlating vector and tensor data</head><p>Tensor data are highly multivariate and rich in information content but they are complex and poorly understood. Vector data are simpler and more familiar to scientists. It is useful to correlate visually tensor and vector fields, not only for our basic understanding of tensor data but also for gleaning new physical insights into vector fields.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Topological skeletons</head><p>We obtain topological skeletons by detecting degenerate points and integrating the set of their connecting separatrices.</p><p>Trisector points in tensor fields play the topological role of saddle points in vector fields. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figures 3 and 6</ref> , they deflect adjacent trajectories in any one of their three hyperbolic sectors toward topologically distinct regions of the domain. Wedge points possess both a hyperbolic and a parabolic sector. They deflect trajectories adjacent in their hyperbolic sector and terminate trajectories impinging on their parabolic sector.</p><p>Here follows an algorithm to extract the topology of a tensor field. This simplified version assumes that there are no merged degenerate points with integral index: 4 use Equation 8 to find the three separatrices {SI, sz, ss} at each trisector point and the two separatrices (~1 , s~) at each wedge point ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 3)</ref>; integrate hyperstreamlines along the separatrices; terminate the trajectories wherever they leave the domain or impinge on the parabolic sector of a wedge point. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">Figure 9</ref> shows an example. The texture represents the most compressive eigenvector of the stress tensor <ref type="bibr">( 5 2 )</ref> . Color encodes as before the magnitude of the compressive force (A,), from most compressive (red) to least compressive (blue). We emphasize the structure of the tensor field by superimposing the topological skeleton of v2. The structure of these time-dependent data is very complex and we simplify the topology (in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">Figure 9</ref> as in the remaining of this article) by computing only those separatrices that originate from trisector points, leaving on the side separatrices that emanate from wedge points.</p><p>We can mentally infer the orientation of the eigenvector at any point in the plane from the topological skeleton. Hyperstreamline trajectories curve so as to follow the shape of the separatrices, bending around wedge points.</p><p>With time, the repeated creation of new wedgetrisector pairs induces periodic topological transitions, -"\ sphere torus 2-holed torus n-holed torus  which we illustrate in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 5</ref>. The newly created pair (T3, We} changes the topologicalstructure of the tensor field.</p><p>As with vector field topology, the power of the representation comes from its simplicity; a few points and lines suffice to reveal the directional information otherwise buried within abundant multivariate data. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Trivariate data visualization</head><p>By using textures or topological skeletons, we render tensor information only partially. Indeed, we see from Equation 1 that 2D tensor data are truly trivariate. If the goal is to correlate full tensor information within a single display, one must visualize simultaneously two eigenvalues and the orientation of the eigenvectors.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>, we use texture, color, and elevation as channels to encode eigenvector direction, longitudinal eigenvalue, and transverse eigenvalue, re~pectively.~ In addition to topological information the display reveals a strong correlation between the two eigenvalues-a fact that was previously overlooked in representations such as Figures 5 and 9.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Tensor Topological Rule</head><p>When a tensor field is defined across a surface M, the topology of M puts a constraint on the number and nature of degenerate points, limiting considerably the variety of possible tensor patterns. We investigate this constraint in this section. defined across M-i.e., N + C + 3 -S.</p><p>In order to extend the PoincarBHopf theorem from vector fields to tensor fields, we make the assumption that the sum of the indices at the degenerate points of a tensor field T(F) defined across the surface M depends only on the topology of M and not on the particular tensor field T(F). The following topological rule results: </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Tensor</formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">1, W -7) + N + C + 3 -S = x(M) (9) 2</formula><p>We refer the reader to Reference [7] for a proof. As with vector fields, this rule establishes a connection between the topology of the surface M-i.e., X(M)-and the structure of any tensor field defined across M-i.e., the sum of indices.</p><p>Equation 9 restricts considerably the number of possible surface tensor patterns. For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows two complex tensor fields-one defined across a torus and another one across a sphere. A topological analysis reveals N = C = 3 = S = 0, W = 7 = 18 for the torus, and N = C = 1, 3 = 0, W = I = 3 for the sphere. Both sets of values satisfy Equation 9 with X(torus) = 0 and x(sphere) = 2, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Extensions and Conclusions</head><p>We can extend the theory of degenerate points to 3-D symmetric tensor fields, which have three real eigenvalues and three orthogonal eigenvectors. At a degenerate point where two eigenvalues are identical, locally two-dimensional patterns such as wedges and trisectors <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Figure 3)</ref> occur in the plane orthogonal to the third eigenvector. However, it remains to characterize the fully three-dimensional patterns that exist in the vicinity of degenerate points where three eigenvalues are identical.</p><p>The results presented above are also useful for unsymmetric tensor fields. We show in Reference [6] that it is always possible to extract a symmetric tensor component from unsymmetric data. We can then apply the topological analysis t o the symmetric component for unveiling, at least partially, the structure of the tensor field.</p><p>In conclusion, visualization allowed us to elucidate the structure of symmetric tensor fields, demonstrating the tremendous potential of the field for building new knowledge beyond the usual goal of inspecting results from experiments and computations.
