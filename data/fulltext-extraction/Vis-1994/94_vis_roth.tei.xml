<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Alaska is situated on the northern boundary of the Pacific Rim. Home to the highest mountains in North America. the mountain ranges of Alaska contain over 40 active volcanoes. shown in red in Plate 1. In the past 200 years most of Alaska's volcanoes have erupted at least once. Alaska is a polar crossroads where aircraft traverse the great circle airways between Asia, Europe and North America. as shown in white in Plate 1. Volcanic eruptions in Alaska and the resulting airborne ash clouds pose a significant hazard to more than 40,000 transpolar flights each year.</p><p>The ash clouds created by volcanic eruptions are invisible to radar and are often concealed by weather clouds. This paper describes a system developed by the Alaska Volcano Observatory and the Arctic Region Supercomputing Center for predicting the movement of ash clouds. Vsing meteorological and geophysical data from volcanic eruptions, a supercomputer model Rick Guritz Alaska Synthetic Aperture Radar Facility University of Alaska Fairbanks, AK 99775</p><p>provides predictions of ash cloud movements for up to 72 hours. The AVS visualization system is used to control the execution of the ash cloud model and to display the model output in three dimensional form showing the location of the ash cloud over a digital terrain model. Eruptions of Mount Redoubt on the morning of <ref type="bibr">December 15, 1989</ref>, sent ash particles more than 40,000 feet into the atmosphere. On the same day, a Boeing 747 passenger jet experienced complete engine failure when it penetrated the ash cloud. The ash cloud prediction system was used to simulate this eruption and to produce an animated flyby of Mount Redoubt during a 12 hour period of the December 15 eruptions including the encounter of the jetliner with the ash cloud. The animation combines the motion of the viewer with the time evolution of the ash cloud above a digital terrain model. The visualization of the aircraft encounter with the ash cloud can be used to test the accuracy of the ash plume model. The aircraft position was known accurately in three dimensions at the time of the encounter and can be compared with the position of the ash cloud produced by the model. Satellite imagery is also used to assess the accuracy of the model by comparing the observed horizontal extent of the ash cloud with the visualization produced from the model data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Ash Plume Model</head><p>The ash cloud visualization is based on the output of a model developed by Hiroshi Tanaka of the Geophysical Instihte of the University of Alaska and Tsukuba University, Japan. Using meteorological data and eruption parameters for input, the model predicts the density of volcanic ash particles in the atmosphere as a function of time. The three dimensional Lagrangian form of the diffusion equation is employed to model particle diffusion, taking into account the size distribution of the ash particles and gravitational settling described by Stokes' law. Details of the model are given in <ref type="bibr">[2, 31.</ref> (See color plates, page  upper atmosphere. These are obtained from CCAR 1-nidata in NetCDF format. Vnidata winds are interpolated to observed conditions on 12 hour intervals. Global circulation models are used to provide up to i 2 hour predictions at 6 hour intervals.</p><p>The eruption parameters for the model include the geographical location of the volcano. the time and duration of the event. altitude of the plume, particle density. and particle density distribution.</p><p>The raw output from the model for each time step consists of a list of particles with an (x.y.2) coordinate for each particle. An AVS module reads the particle data and increments the particle counts for the cells formed by an array indexed over (x,y,z). We chose a resolution of 15Ox15Ox.50 for the particle density array. which equals 1.1 million data points at each solution point in time. For the video animation. we ran the model with a time step of 5 minutes. For 13 hours of simulated time. the model produced 162 plumes.</p><p>amounting to approximately 730 MB of integer valued volume data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Ash Cloud Visualization</head><p>The ash cloud is rendered as an isosurface with a brown color approximating volcanic ash. The rendering obtained through this technique gives the viewer a visual effect showing the boundaries of the ash cloud. Details of the cloud shape are highlighted through lighting effects and. when viewed on a computer workstation. the resulting geometry can be manipulated interactively to view the ash cloud from any desired direct ion. At any point in time, the particle densities in the ash cloud are represented by the values in a 150sl.5Os50 element integer array. The limits of the cloud may be observed using the isosurface module in the network shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> with the isosurface level set equal to 1.</p><p>in the array decrease and holes and isolated cells begin to appear in the isosurface around the edges of the plume where the density is between zero and one particle. These effects are especially noticeable in a time animation of the plume evolution. To create a more uniform cloud for the video animation, without increasing the overall particle counts, the density array was low pass filtered by an inverse square kernel before creating the isosurface. An example of a filtered plume created by this technique is shown in Plate 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Plume Animation</head><p>The plume model must use time steps of 5 minutes or greater due to limitations of the model. Plumes that are generated at 5 minute intervals may be displayed to create a flip chart animation of the time evolution of the cloud. However, the changes in the plume over a 5 minute interval can be fairly dramatic and shorter time intervals are required to create the effect of a smoothly evolving cloud. To accomplish this without generating additional plume volumes we interpolate between successive plume volumes. Using the field math module, we implemented linear interpolation between plume volumes in the network shown in  The linear interpolation formula is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P ( t ) = Pj + (Pj+l -Pj)t, 0 5 t 5 1, (1)</formula><p>where Pi is the plume volume at model time step i and t is time. The difference term in (1) is formed in the upper field math module. The lower field math module sums its inputs. Normally, a separate module would be required to perform the multiplication by t .</p><p>However, it is possible to multiply the output port of a field math module by a constant value when the network is executed from a CLI script and this is the approach we used to create the video animation of the (See color plates, page CP-46.) rameter interactively. it is necessary to insert a third field math module to perform the multiplication on the output of the upper module. This can be an extremely effective device for producing smooth time animation of discrete data sets in conjunction with the AVS Animator module.</p><p>One additional animation effect was introduced to improve the appearance of the plume at the beginning of the eruption. The plume model assumes that the plume reaches the specified eruption height instantaneously. Thus. the plume model for the first time step produces a cylindrical isosurface of uniform particle densities above the site of the eruption. To create the appearance of a cloud initially rising from the ground, we defined an artificial plume for time 0. The time 0 plume isosurface consists of an inverted cone of negative plume densities centered over the eruption coordinates. The top of the plume volume contains the most negative density values. When this plume volume is interpolated with the model plume from time step 1, the resulting plume rises from the ground and reaches the full eruption height at t = 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Terrain Visualization</head><p>The geographical region for this visualization study is an area in southcentral Alaska which lies between 141O -160° west longitude and 60° -6'7' north latitude. The corners of the region define a Cartesian coordinate system and the extents of the volcano plume data must be adjusted to obtain the correct registration of the plume data in relation to the terrain.</p><p>The terrain features are based on topographic data obtained from the US Geological Survey with a grid spacing of approximately 90 meters. This grid was much too large to process at the original resolution and was downsized to a 1426x1051 element array of terrain elevations. which corresponds to a grid size of approximately 1/2 mile. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, the terrain data were read in AVS field data format and u-ere converted to a geometry using the field to mesh module. We also included a downsize module ahead of field to mesh because even the 1426x1051 terrain exceeded available memory on all but our largest machines. For prototyping and animation design. we typically downsized by factors of 2 to 4 in order to speed up the terrain rendering.</p><p>The colors of the terrain are set in the generate colormap module according to elevation of the terrain and were chosen to approximate ground cover during the fall season in Alaska. The vertical scale of the terrain was exaggerated by a factor of 60 to To create the global zoom sequence in the introduction to the video animation, this image was used as a texture map that was overlaid onto a lower resolution terrain model for the entire state of Alaska. This technique also allowed the study area to be highlighted in such a way as to create a smooth transition into the animation sequence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Flight Path Visualization</head><p>The flight path of the jetliner in the animation was produced by applying the tube module to a polyline geometry produced by the read geom module. The animation of the tube was performed by a simple program which takes as its input a time dependent cubic spline. The program evaluates the spline at specified points to create a polyline geometry for read geom. Each new point added to the polyline causes a new segment of the flight path to be generated. Four separate tube modules were employed to allow the flight path segmenfs to be colored green, red, yellow, and green during the engine failure and restart sequence.</p><p>The path of the jetliner is based on flight recorder data obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration. The flight path was modeled using three dimensional time dependent cubic splines. The technique for deriving and manipulating the spline functions is so powerful that we created a new module called the this module are described in <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>. A similar technique is used to control the camera motion required for the flyby in the video animation.</p><p>By combining the jetliner flight path with the animation of the ash plume described earlier. a simulated encounter of the jet with the ash cloud can be studied in an animated sequence. The resulting simulation provides valuable information about the accuracy of the plume model. Because ash plumes are invisible to radar and may be hidden from satellites by weather clouds. it is often very difficult to determine the exact position and extent of an ash cloud from direct observations. However. when a jetliner penetrates an ash cloud. the effects are immediate and unmistakable and the aircraft position is usually known rather accurately. This was the case during the December 15 encounter.</p><p>By comparing the intersection point of the jetliner flight path with the plume model to the point of intersection with the actual plume. one can determine if the leading edge of the plume model is in the correct position. Both the plume model and the flight path must be correctly cc-registered to the terrain data in order to perform such a test. Vsing standard transformations between latitude-longitude and x-y coordinates for the terrain. we calculated the appropriate coordinate transformations for the plume model and jet flight path. The first time the animation was run we were quite amazed to observe the flight path turn red. denoting engine failure. at precisely the point where the flight path encountered the leading edge of the modeled plume. Apparently this was one of those rare times when we got everything right. The fact that the aircraft position is well known at all times. and that it encounters the ash cloud at the correct time and place lends strong support for the correctness of the model. Plate 4 shows a frame from the video animation at the time when the jetliner landed in Anchorage. The ash cloud in this image is drifting from left to right and away from the viewer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Satellite Image Comparison</head><p>Ash clouds can often be detected in AVHRR satellite images. For the December 15 events. only one image recorded at 1:27pm AST was available. At the time of this image most of the study area was blanketed by clouds. Tevertheless. certain atmospheric features become visible when the image is subjected to enhancement. as shown in Plate 5 . A north-south frontal system is moving northeasterly from the left side of the image. The satellite image was enhanced in a manner which causes ash clouds to appear black. There is clearly a dark plume extending from Mount Redoubt near the lower edge of the image to the northeast and ending in the vicinity of Anchorage. The size of this plume indicates that it is less than an hour old. Thus. it could not be the source of the plume which the jet encountered approximately 2 hours before this image was taken.</p><p>There are additional black areas in the upper right quadrant of the image Rhich are believed to have originated with the 10:lSameruption. These are the clouds which the jet is believed to have penetrated approximately 2 hours before this image was taken. The image has been annotated with the jetliner flight path entering in the top center of the image and proceeding from top to bottom in the center of the image. The ash cloud encounter occurred at the point where the flight path reverses course to the north and east. However. the satellite image does not show any ash clouds remaining in the vicinity of the flight path by the time of this image.</p><p>iYhen the satellite image is compared with the plume model for the same time period. shown at approximately the same scale in Plate 6. a difference in the size of the ash cloud is readily apparent. While the leading edge of the simulated plume stretching to the northeast is located in approximately the same position as the dark clouds in the satellite image. the cloud from the simulated plume is much longer. The length of the simulated plume is controlled by the duration of the eruption. Rhich was 40 minutes.</p><p>Two explanat ions for the differences have been proposed. The first is that the length of the eruption was determined from seismic data. Seismicity does not necessarily imply the emission of ash and therefore the actual ash emission time may have been less than 40 minutes. The second possibility is that the trailing end of the ash cloud may be invisible in the satellite image due to cloud cover. It is worth noting that the ash cloud signatures in this satellite image are extremely weak compared to cloudless images. In studies of the few other eruptions where clear images were available. the ash clouds are unmistakable in the satellite image and the model showed excellent agreement with the (See color plates, page CP-46.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusions</head><p>An ash plume modeling and prediction system has been developed using AVS for visualization and a Cray supercomputer for model computations. A simulation of the December 15 encounter with ash clouds from Mount Redoubt by a jetliner provides strong support for the accuracy of the model. Although the satellite data for this event are relatively limited. agreement of the model with satellite data for other events is very good. The animated visualization of the eruption which was produced using AVS demonstrates that AVS is an extremely effective tool for developing visualizations and animations. The Spline Animator module was developed to perform flybys and may be used to construct animated curves or flight paths in 3D.</p></div>
