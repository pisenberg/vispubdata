			<abstract>
				<p>The recent advent of computer graphics techniques has helped to bridge the gap between architectural concepts and actual buildings. Closing this gap is especially critical an healthcare facilities. In this paper, we present new techniques to support the design decision process and apply them to the design of a neonatal intensive care unit. Two issues are addressed: ergonometric accessibility and visual supervision of spaces. These two issues can be investigated utilizing new technologies that demonstrate that computers are more than a medium of communication in the field of architecture; the computer can make a significant contribution as a proactive design tool. 1 Overview This paper describes an interdisciplinary project between faculty of the Visualization Laboratory and the Department of Architecture at Texas A&amp;M University. The need t o design appropriate environments is most keenly felt in the area of healthcare facility architecture. The built environment can influence health outcomes by mitigating the impact of stressful environments [16] and supporting the processes required to provide a high level of patient care. In some cases, good facility design and appropriate space adjacencies may enhance the ability of medical staff to save lives.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The key t o good design of healthcare facilities is accurate and thorough communication with the client during the design process. The traditional techniques utilized by design professionals to enhance interaction have included interviews and questionnaires, postoccupancy evaluations, behavioral observation, gaming (tools that enable design team members participate directly in the design process by manipulating game pieces that represent the elements of the environment) and full-scale mockups. Of these techniques, full-scale mockups provide the most veridical information about the nature of an environment, although Mardelle Shepley Department of Architecture Texas A&amp;M University College Station, TX 77843-3137 they are expensive and time-consuming to build, and inappropriate for large components of the design.</p><p>Unfortunately, none of these techniques, including mockups, provide sufficient information to enable architects to account for all significant implications of a proposed design. With the advent of virtual reality technology and computer graphics, however, a less cumbersome and more accurate alternative to these techniques is available. Using such technology, the healthcare client is empowered to participate directly in the design process and the architect is provided the opportunity t o fully understand the implications of his/her design. A designer can test concepts about a space, a component of a building's interior/exterior, or the use of a space by representing, analyzing, and refining the design before it is adopted. Visualization makes it possible for designers to preview the results of their theories via pictures or animations.</p><p>In this paper, which utilized drawings of a proposed intensive care nursery by The Design Partnership, Architects, the visualization construct demonstrates that the project team can experience the medical setting before it is built; nurses and physicians can watch a staff member in action, working within the environment. Such opportunities allow administrators, staff and designers to communicate more efficiently during the design process. Additionally, by allowing the design team to pre-experience the space, controversial innovations can be tested without fear of failure.</p><p>While the application in this project focused on interior space, the technology is also intended to illustrate the implications of entire buildings and sites. Support during the design process can be given at a variety of environmental scales ranging from master planning to furniture and equipment design. Other aspects of a potential project that can be studied include the adequacy of barrier-free design, the implications of spatial volumes and the efficiency of way-finding (the ability to understand the layout of a building and arrive at a destination). With regard to way-finding, hospitals are notoriously confusing to negotiate, and a whole specialty area in the design profession has been developed to enhance the cognitive clarity of a building "journey".</p><p>Additionally, the technology can be used to evaluate code compliance. This is often neglected in the early stages of the design process, but increasingly complex laws and professional liabilities reinforce the importance of considering these factors throughout the development of a project. Our innovative techniques will enable architects to think about these factors at the appropriate time.</p><p>The architect can focus on particular aspects of a design by using separate programs that perform calculations on specific properties <ref type="bibr">[14, 151.</ref> In this paper, we used human figure models within the 3D CAD models in order to experience the spaces and the ergonometric accessibility of different objects in the environment. The problem of accessibility cannot be easily understood by using traditional representations.It is also difficult t o imagine what a person can see in a space by using traditional drawings and CAD system abstractions. For the neonatal intensive care unit design, we were able to address ergonometric accessibility and visual supervision issues by integrating human figure models into our geometric CAD models prior to construction. Our goal is to provide the design team with an understanding of the completed architecture design before it is built.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Issues and Results</head><p>In this section, two problems associated with the design of physical environment and the results of our study are discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The Ergonometric Accessibility Issue</head><p>In recent years, the architectural community has placed an emphasis on ergonometric compatibility in workspace design. In response to this approach, we developed techniques utilizing redundant articulated chain physiology modeling [2, 3, 4, 11. An articulated chain is a series of links connected with either revolute or prismatic joints such as a robotic manipulator or a human limb.</p><p>The reachable workspace of an articulated chain is the volume or space encompassing all points that a reference point P on the hand (or the end effector) traces as all the joints move through their respective ranges of motion <ref type="bibr">[ll]</ref>. Realistic human figure models are based on anthropometric characteristics such as link (segment) dimensions and joint limits. Different sized (percentile) human figures are modeled as parameterized anthropometric articulated chains. An ef-ficient system for 3D workspace visualization of redundant articulated chains is utilized in simulating taskoriented activities of different size-percentile agents.</p><p>Three-dimensional workspace visualization has applications in a variety of fields such as computeraided design, human figure modeling, ergonomic studies, computer graphics and artificial intelligence, and robotics. In computer-aided design, the three dimensional workspace of a human limb or robotic manipulator can be used in the interior design of buildings. Computer graphics human figure modeling has been used in cockpit and car occupant studies, space station design, product safety studies, and maintenance assessment <ref type="bibr">[7, 5, 9,</ref> 101. American Disabilities Act ( A D A ) experiments by creating human models limited by specific physical disabilities. Finally, this system can be used in visualizing sequences of human movements in order to attain the optimal working environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The Visual Supervision Issue</head><p>Traditionally, the design process has emphasized the two-dimensional relationship between spaces. Even with the support of models and perspective drawings, it is difficult to precreate the visual experience of moving through a building. Utilizing the technology developed in this paper, however, the architect and the client can visualize and experience what a human can see inside the building during the early stages of the design process by attaching a camera to the eyes of the simulated human figure. A selected field of view is displayed as a translucent pair of view cones, one for each eye <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. Viewable objects are shadowed by the translucent cones which move with the eyes, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Result Summary</head><p>The information contained in this spatial visualization enables architects and clients to validate design decisions. In this application, access t o outlets and equipment as well as quality of visual supervision of the intensive care nursery and monitors was examined. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> illustrates an overview of a nursery bay looking toward an exterior window. This scene enables staff t o visualize the impact of windows on the (See color plates, page CP-43.) nursery environment. A view of baby station showing cabinet and isolette location is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The greater detail provided here allows medical staff to understand the scale of the workspace. Finally, <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> illustrates the view from the infant's vantage point inside an isolette. Addressing the needs of both patients and staff is essential for good health facility design.</p><p>A video tape has been developed t o describe these new visualization techniques as applied to healthcare facilities design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>The recent advent of computer graphics techniques has helped to bridge the gap between the conceptual and the actual building. In this paper, we found that the following steps are necessary to refine the technology:</p><p>New fast-rendering algorithms are needed to produce more realistic pictures in a shorter amount of time.</p><p>A simulation of the acoustical environment should be integrated into the visualized environment to enhance the veridicality of the experience.</p><p>New visualization tools such as stereo glasses wll further enhance the 3D experience.</p><p>Multi-level systems need to be designed that will allow a trade-off between time and quality.</p><p>While work remains to be done to complete the development of a virtual reality technology that can be readily utilized by the average design professional, the basic technology is already available. Ultimately, these computer techniques are likely to revolutionize the design process.</p></div>		</body>
