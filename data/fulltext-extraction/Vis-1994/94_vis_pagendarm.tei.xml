				<p>The flow problem In computational fluid dynamics visualization is a frequently used tool for data evaluation, understanding offlow characteristics, and qualitative comparison to flow visualizations originating from experiments. Building on an existing visualization sofhvare system, that allows for a careful selection of state-of-the-art visualization techniques and some extensions, it became possible to present various features of the data in a single image. The visualizations show vortexposition and rotation as well as skin-friction lines, experimental oil-flow traces, and shock-wave positions. By adding experimental flow visualization, a comparison between numerical simulation and wind-tunnel flow becomes possible up to a high level of detail. Since some of the underlying algorithms are not yet described in detail in the visualization literature, some experiences gained from the implementation are illustrated.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Numerical flow simulation creates demanding data of high complexity, which requires a well selected combination of visualization techniques to visualize the dominant properties of the data and the significant structures needed to gain insight into the flow. By carefully reducing the number of visual elements required for the representation of a given feature in the data, one may free space in the image for the visualization of other features present at the same time. Eventually, even data from different sources, such as an image from an experiment and visual elements from numerically simulated flows, may be visualized in a single image. It turns out that interesting discoveries become possible only due to this combined visualization. Complex visualization that provides a collective presentation of different features offers better insight into the interaction of physical phenomena. The major benefit for aerodynamicists, however, was only achieved due to the successful combination of vortex visualization, shock visualization, skin-friction lines, and oil-flow patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 1</head><p>Geometry of the flat plate, wedge, and fin configuration placed in a hypersonic flow field (schematic view)</p><p>The visualization of phenomena in flows will be demonstrated using data kindly supplied by T. <ref type="bibr">Gerhold [1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The flow simulation results from a Navier-Stokes solution for a blunt-fin I wedge configuration (see: <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>) in a hypersonic flow at a Mach number of 5. The flow shows a horseshoe type of vortex. The simulation also resolves a smaller secondary vortex that rotates in the opposite direction. These vortices produce characteristic traces on the wall, which have been visualized in the numerical data as well as in a wind-tunnel flow for direct comparison. A second significant phenomenon in this flow field is a pattern of shock waves, This flow is studied to learn more about the interaction of shock waves and complex three-dimensional boundary layers or viscous flows in general. Even though the geometry appears to be simple an extremely complex threedimensional flow field is generated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Visualization of wall friction</head><p>As in this case experimental fluid mechanics of hypersonic flows is frequently done in blow-down wind tunnels. These facilities allow only a short-duration of constant-flow condition. Therefore the data collected within a single experiment are extremely limited. Scalar quantities such as pressure are often measured at a small number of locations on the wall. Usually there are no measurements in the three-dimensional flow field. The use of oil-flow visualization allows global acquisition of near-wall-velocity directional information. Thus oil-flow patterns are a powerful representation of flow behaviour.</p><p>The technique employs a dye dispersed in a special oil. This oil is sprayed on the solid walls of the model in the wind tunnel. Due to viscous action of the flow velocity close to the wall, the oil moves slowly in the local flow direction. When the oil evaporates it leaves behind a trace of dye, which marks the local flow direction.</p><p>In order to compare numerical flow simulations with such experiments, one has to visualize the near-wall flow field. The direction of a flow velocity field is frequently visualized using streamlines. In simulations of viscous flows the velocity of the flow at a solid wall is zero by definition. This prevents the calculation of streamlines directly on the walls. One would like to find the limiting streamline at locations where the velocity goes to zero while the direction of the velocity vector is determined by the direction of the velocity near the wall. Limiting streamlines on a simpler fin/ flat-plate configuration were presented already by Hung and Buning <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Helman and Hesselink <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> point out some of the difficulties of such an approach using an example from <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. At that time those limiting streamlines were probably generated by performing a particle tracing in the flow regime close to the wall (in the case of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> by using additional constraints on the velocity component normal to the wall.. Today skinfriction lines are commonly used instead of near-wall particle traces. Visualization of skin-friction lines has been used for a long time for comparison with oil-flow patterns. (e.g. see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> ). Therefore, the main interest here is concerned with the particular implementation within a visualization system.</p><p>All images in this paper where created using the visualization system HIGHEND <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. This system is easily extendible and the data processing needed for visualization of skinfriction lines was quickly performed using existing tools after adding small pieces of code.</p><p>The expression "wall-friction lines" results from using the wall shear vector for visualization purposes. The wall shear vector z , is the derivative normal to the wall of the + velocity vector v . In general it is nonzero and points in the direction of the near-wall velocity vectors when projected normal to the wall. The wall shear z , may be calcu-3 lated from the gradient of the velocity vector v after introducing a wall coordinate system where is the coordinate vector normal to the wall. The gradient VV may be calculated using a Gaussian integral formulation vt, = lim (tjs d~)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A v + o</formula><p>This allows for an easy implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> that is insensitive to a pathological or degenerated grid cell in the numerical data set. To calculate the vorticity, a staggered grid is generated by creating new vertices in the centre of each grid cell (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>). This is done by calculating the coordinates of the centre vertex as the arithmetical mean of the coordinates of the surrounding vertices.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">i-l,j+l,k+l i+l,i+l,k+l i-1 j -l,k+l i-1 j -1 a - i+l j -1 ,k- ,k-1 i+l j + l ,k-1 .1 Fig. 2</formula><p>A staggered grid around the grid point ij,k is used. The integration is performed on the surface of the inner volume. For simplicity, this figure shows a Cartesian grid where cells are cubes. However the approach may be generalized towards curvilinear or even unstructured grids.</p><p>After the wall shear T, has been calculated on all solid boundaries represented in the data, a standard streamline integration algorithm using a second-order Runge-Kutta scheme is used to integrate the friction lines from the shear vector field. The skin-friction lines provide global information about the near-wall flow field ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>) Experienced aerodynamicists will be able to imagine even qualitatively the After careful interactive matching of the viewing conditions which was required in this case, the skin-friction lines could be projected into the image showing the oil-flow pattern in the wind tunnel experiment. The resulting combined image ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4</ref>) increases confidence in the overall correct numerical simulation. Some local discrepancies could be explained by a local lack of resolution in the numerical simulation. However, the experiment clearly shows a second weak separation line in the lower side wall of the fin, which does not show in the numerically generated skin-friction lines <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5)</ref>. The experiment suggests that there is a vortex at some distance overall three-dimensional flow pattern in the flow field from these wall patterns. In particular, skin-friction lines show the location of separation and reattachment of the flow at the wall. As mentioned, earlier experiments were performed in a wind tunnel to provide measurements and visualization to match the numerical flow simulation. Oil-flow patterns were captured as a photograph. Due to the limited access to the wind tunnel during the experiments, the photograph shows a perspective view of the fin taken from a side of the wind tunnel.</p><p>-from the wall, which is the reason for this pattern. and wedge.</p><p>Unfortunately, some of the details of the positions and the equipment used when recording the experiments were not available anymore. Therefore, for direct comparison of significant lines and oil-flow pattern, the perspective had to be reconstructed from the edges of the model visible in the image. separation trace s2, which is not visible in the numerical data</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Vortex visualization</head><p>A vortex would be expected to be present in the numerical solution as well. However, due to a lack of resolution for very small vortices it might be too weak to influence the skin-friction lines visibly.</p><p>The visualization of vortices typically relies on particle traces. Calculation of particle traces within a flow field is a well known visualization technique that similary to flow visualization by injection of dye into real flows. The construction of trajectory lines is generally applicable to all kinds of vector data. Presumably it is because of the similarity to experimental flow visualization techniques that the visualization of such lines is frequently mentioned in the literature of computational fluid dynamics (see among others [10], <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>). Some authors study the accuracy problem in detail (see: <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>). Today, most visualization systems make use of a second-order Runge-Kutta integra- tion scheme. However, some authors report alternative methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>, [17]. Volpe <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> suggested the display of stream ribbons for a more understandable visualization of flow fields. He demonstrated how to obtain the impression of a ribbon floating in the flow field by calculating a large number of adjacent streamlines. Those lines must be placed very close to each other to keep the gaps invisible in the image. Another way of creating stream ribbons is by constructing polygons between two neighbouring lines. A simple method to create such polygons by the use of a marching triangulation algorithm is illustrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[18]</ref>. A similar approach is reported by <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>. Both approaches fail if the flow field is diverging because the two limiting streamlines depart from each other. Eventually they will be far enough from each other that physically unfeasible effects occur in the visualization. Such effects could be the crossing of stream ribbons or ribbons passing through solid flow boundaries.</p><p>To produce valid visualizations in such circumstances, it is necessary to calculate the stream ribbon from a single trajectory line. Again, this approach has been used in the past. In particular the famous NCSA video on a 'Severe Thunderstorm' shows swirling ribbons. Therefore, the following description concentrates on implementation issues. Calculating stream ribbons from more than one streamline often fails because the numerical values of two near by velocity vectors differ significantly. This allows for a growing distance between two adjacent lines. A straightforward approach to avoid this considers one of the two lines as a primary line that marks the location of the ribbon and uses the second streamline calculation only for obtaining the orientation of the line in space while keeping the two lines at a constant distance. Such an approach may be derived from an algorithm suggested for tracking of surface particles by van Wijk <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[20]</ref>. However, in fluid dynamics information on vortical behaviour is commonly obtained by applying the rota-  </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">v</formula><p>.The angular velocity, or vorticity w , is simply one half rot v .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">-</head><p>Since flow simulation data frequently are stored on curvilinear or even unstructured grids, it may require some effort to evaluate the rotation or curl because the transformation of the coordinates has to be taken into account. However, one may again take advantage of replacing the rotation or curl by a Gaussian integral:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">rot v 3 = Vxv 3 = -1im</formula><p>This approach allows an implementation very similar to the one suggested earlier for the evaluation of the gradient of a scalar field <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Once the vorticity o is calculated everywhere in the vector field, the vorticity vector may be projected onto the local flow direction to obtain the angular velocity of rotation in the local streamwise direction, which allows the detrmination of the stream-ribbon swirl.</p><p>Note that oribbonis a scalar quantity, since the direction is defined by the local direction of the velocity vector or the streamline. This quantity is a measure of rigid body rotation in the flow field. It is not identical to another scalar quantity often used to find vortical motion in flow fields, the helicity, which is simply the cosine of the angle between the vorticity vector and the velocity vector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Construction of a stream ribbon</head><p>First, a streamline or particle path is calculated using an established particle tracing algorithm. This program produces a line as a series of coordinates. The system was extended in such a way that for each point along the line the magnitudes of the local velocity vector l ?l and the local streamwise vorticity wsaemwise are stored as well. These values are obtained within the grid cell by trilinear interpolation. Knowledge of the local velocity of the flow along a streamline allows the calculation of the elapsed time between two points on the line at a distance s. Simple Eulerian integration was found to be accurate enough for visualization purposes after comparing the results with an alternative method <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[18]</ref> for a number of cases.</p><p>The ribbon is constructed of a series of polygons. These follow the streamline and are oriented according to the local angle integrated from the angular velocity. In general, ribbons which extend symmetrically to both sides of the defining streamline are more suitable for visualization purposes.</p><p>i-1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 6</head><p>Construction of a stream ribbon along the path of a streamline while rotating it around the line with the given angle a(s)</p><p>The normal of the edge i is rotated in a plane normal to the streamline. The rotation angle relative to the edge i-1 is</p><p>given by a(s). The width b of the ribbon is kept constant.</p><p>This marching procedure constructs a stream ribbon of constant width (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>). The initial angle of the first polygon on a line may be chosen arbitrarily. Often, this angle will be identical with a physical coordinate axis. It is recommended to choose the same initial angle for all ribbons within one image. Analogous to the method pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[20]</ref>, the orientation of the ribbon could be deducted using a Frenet frame with similar results. The Frenet frame needs special treatment to resolve ambiguities for straight streamlines. The method presented here is straight forward to implement and was found accurate enough in various test cases. Obviously, the ribbon will not change orientation in an irrotational field. In a field of solid body rotation with axial translation super-imposed, the ribbon shows the correct swirl whether it is placed on the vortex axis or away from it. The width of the ribbon may be chosen arbitrarily as well. Therefore, it is possible to adjust the width to the scale of the ribbon within the image. Small vortical structures may require a comparatively large ribbon to make the swirl visible. This is a major advantage compared to the technique of constructing a ribbon between two streamlines, because in that case both lines are restricted to stay close to the centre of the vortex else the method would fail. The technique presented here however is not restricted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Vortex pattern near the blunt fin</head><p>The flow shows a horseshoe type of vortex. The simulation also resolves a smaller secondary vortex that rotates in opposite direction <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 7)</ref>. In particular, in the vincinity of the stagnation region ahead of the fin the vortices are accelerated when they pass the fin. This is advantageous for the visualization since a streamline release in this region is sucked into the vortex and remains very close to the central core for a long time. Ribbons represent vortices in the flow field. The image allows the examination of threedimensional phenomena with respect to their traces on the solid walls Therefore, streamlines were carefully selected to hit the vortex close to the plane of symmetry then follow the centre of the vortex past the fin. The ribbons were calculated for two streamlines, one for each of the vortices. To find streamlines that stay within the vortex core, the starting point for the streamline must be placed accurately in the centre of the vortex. This may be done interactively. while in the two-dimensional or surface-flow case significant starting points may be found by means of topology analysis [3], this is not necessarily sufficient in the threedimensional case. However visualization of restricted streamlines in a plane through the flow domain provide a good starting point for interactive refinement.The full path of the line consists of a part integrated forward through the converging vortex core while the part of the line that approaches the fin from the inflow boundary was integrated backwards to meet the vortex exactly. Careful selection of streamlines and calculation of ribbons allows representing the vortex pattern with effective and easy to perceive visual objects that do not clutter the image</p><p>In the case discussed here, the horseshoe vortex passes the fin with increasing distance while the secondary vortex stays very close to the side wall of the fin. When visualized in combination with the oil-flow pattern obtained in the win tunnel experiment, the position of this secondary vortex explains nicely the weak trace of a separating flow half way up the fin. <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref> shows the vortex core close to the fin, slightly below the lower separation trace. The vortex must be below this trace to topologically explain the pattern on the fin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 8</head><p>Three-dimensional vortex cores from the numerical simulation visualized in combination with oil-flow traces from wind tunnel experiments</p><p>As suspected earlier, this vortex may be represented a bit too weak, due to spatial resolution in the simulation. This could explain why the skin friction lines as they are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig.  3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4</ref> do not show this separation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Vortex and shock wave interaction</head><p>The location of the vortices are typically very much determined by their interaction with the shock waves present in this three-dimensional flow field. In the past, most visualizations of shock phenomena relied on pseudo colours or isolines on cuts through the data space. These methods were already used by Hung and Buning <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> to visualize shock locations in a comparable flow field. Their paper as well as the related work of Hung and Kordulla <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[23]</ref> provide visualization of scalar data such as Mach number or pressure in various two-dimensional slices of the flow field for presentaion of the complex flow field. In the plane of symmetry they provide an early example of a combined visualization showing "two-dimensional streamlines" together with isocontours.</p><p>To visualize the three-dimensional shape of shock waves, a shock detection and visualization technique was implemented using the HIGHEND visualization system mentioned earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 9</head><p>Three-dimensional shock waves from the numerical simulation visualized in combination with oil-flow traces from wind tunnel experiments This method constructs a surface that matches the maximum of the local density change everywhere in the flow field. The gradient of the scalar quantity density is projected onto the local flow direction vector to find the location of maximal compression in the streamwise direction. By connecting these locations, a surface is formed, which may be visualized as a transparent surface. In the case discussed here, various shock waves are present in the flow field.</p><p>The blunt fin creates a dominant detached bow shock. The sharp kink in the bottom wall formed by the wedge forms an oblique ascending shock wave, which starts at the location of the kink and is steeper than the wedge. Both shock waves intersect. As a result of the intersection of the fin with the bottom wall and the horseshoe type vortex, there is a third part of the shock pattern that encloses the vortex. More details still await further analysis. However, these prominent phenomena already provide insight into the interaction of different flow properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(See color plates, page CP-12.)</head><p>Because of viscous action near the walls, shocks become weaker there and will not be traced. Their position and shape in the vicinity of the fin clearly indicate the interaction between the shock wave and the separation traces in the oilflow image <ref type="figure">(Fig. 9)</ref>. The shapes of the shock waves are bent by interaction with vortices, as may be seen when visualizing the vortex cores in combination with the shock waves <ref type="figure">(Fig. 10)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>Visualization has been technology driven for a long time, pseudocolour playing a dominant role. A large variety of visualization methods is known today. However, only the integrated application of carefully selected techniques provide better insight even into complex data with different phenomena being simultaneously present. Each technique applied in this example provides a compact, meaningful representation of a selected feature in the data without occupying too much space in the image. The combined visualization of different flow features provides insight into the interaction of phenomena. Further improvements were obtained by including the combined visualization of data from different sources such as numerical simulations and wind tunnel experiments. Due to a perspective mapping and blending technique, comparison between data from different sources was not restricted to image-level comparison by placing images side by side. Presentation of both data within a single image allows for quantitative evaluation, for example of displacement of features.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>3 9 3</head><label>33</label><figDesc>Tw = vs-(Vv.n) 3</figDesc></figure>
