			<abstract>
				<p>Visualization techniques are applied to an electric power system transmission network to create a graphical picture of network power flows and voltages. A geographic data map is used. Apparent power flow is encoded as the width of an arrow, with direction f?om real power flow. Flows are superposed on flow limits. Contour plots and color coding failed for representing bus voltages, A two-color thermometer encoding worked well. The resulting visualization is a significant improvement over current user interface practice in the power indus-W.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Electric power systems are operated by dispatchers located in a control center equipped with a process control computer system called an Energy Management System</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(EMS). [ l ]</head><p>The EMS collects data from locations throughout the power system, allows the dispatchers to control power system equipment in remote locations and executes analysis functions on the collected data. EMSs have a complex user interface based on CRT displays and keyboard and pointing device input.</p><p>The power system itself is a large electrical network, with hundreds of buses (nodes) connected by hundreds of transmission lines and transformers (branches) operating in sinusoidal steady state. Existing CRT displays can show a few of the many collected and computed voltages and power flows in numerical form placed on a small portion of the complete circuit diagram.</p><p>Because of the size of the power system, dispatchers can suffer severely from information overload in normal operation, and even more so, and more critically, in casualties. The EMS user interface is therefore a logical candidate for the application of visualization techmques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Visualization</head><p>Principles for effective visualization [2], guidance found in Tufte [3,4] and from scientific visualization [5] are used to create an improved representation for power system operating state for use in the routine monitoring task, specifically the line power flows and bus voltage magnitudes of a power system. The objective of this representation is to give a global view of the line flows and bus voltages, to communicate information about proximity to limits, and to call attention to limit violations.</p><p>A first principle is to show as much of the data as possible, ideally all of it. A geographic data map of the entire power system is chosen as the most appropriate representation. There are two commonly used graphical representations for the transmission system found in engineering drawings: geographic and orthogonal. The geographic representation shows the actual routes of the lines between substations, while the orthogonal representation is more like a circuit diagram, with the lines laid out with right angle bends. Even in the orthogonal representation, the substations are arranged approximately by geography. Many dispatchers tend to discuss system state problems in conjunction with a geographic map. The major advantage of a geographic representation appears to be that it engages the natural human ability to remember and to reason about geographic data. The direction of arrival of transmission lines at substations may be an important visual cue. For this reason, a representation is used that places the substations in their approximate locations, and connects them with straight line segments representing the transmission lines. The strict geographic layout is modified to show transformers as lines of some minimum length. They are an important part of the overall system flow picture and of flow limitations, but would be invisible in a strict geographic representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Line Flow Encoding</head><p>Graphical encodings work best when they are intuitive. It is easy to recognize such natural encodings, but hard to devise them. For flow, Minard successfully encoded the flow of wine exports as the width of paths.</p><p>[3] The flow of power may be similarly encoded. The encoding of flow as width appears to be a useful natural encoding related to the effect of water flow in a stream. As the amount of flow increases, the stream gets deeper and wider. When too much flow exists, it overflows its banks. This suggests encoding power flow as line width, and power flow limits also as a width. Limits are colored gray, to set them further into the background, while a subdued brown color is used for flow.</p><p>Because line flows and limits are commonly discussed in terms of apparent power (MVA), apparent power is encoded. However, apparent power has no direction, and direction of power flow is important to the dispatcher. Direction, encoded with an arrowhead, is taken from real power (MW) ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). While it would be ideal to also see reactive power flow (MVAR), an effective encoding for presenting both real and reactive power on one display has not yet been developed. The nature of the monitoring task places a higher importance on the MVA and MW drection.</p><p>Line flow and limits are encoded as actual MVA, not as a percentage of limits, using the same scale for every line. The human eye can easily extract the approximate percentage loading from the representation of the actual values, whle the actual flow permits comparison with other overload problems in the system.</p><p>Because an overload is a qualitatively different state, the encoding should undergo a qualitative change. This is done by changing the color of the arrow. Line flow limits are displayed as a hollow box inside the arrow. These visual cues, in addition to the width of the line flow arrow, call attention to overloads <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>.</p><p>Relatively few variations of line flow encoding were tried. Most involved getting rid of spontaneous chartjunk, such as arrows with heads a different color than the body. A few variations were sigmfkant. Shaded areas for limits proved easier to comprehend than the original idea of using an outline box. <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref> In theory, all of the information about line flow and its limits is encoded in one half of the line. The other side is just redundant. Bssed on this reasoning, it was proposed to split the line in half lengthwise and display only one half. This way the same information would be displayed in half the space, improving information density. <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref> This reasoning proved entirely specious, when the encoding was applied to the global display. <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5 )</ref> Human pattern recognition apparently prefers symmetry and has trouble with asymmetrical encoding in random orientations.</p><p>Red was the first color chosen to indicate a limit violation. This would be a natural encoding for the general public, but power system dispatchers have a Merent redgreen encoding that can create confusion. In the power system world, closed switches and circuit breakers show a red light, to indicate that the equipment is energized, and therefore dangerous, while open devices show a green light to indicate safety. However, in normal operation, most devices are closed, so to a dispatcher, red means OK and green means trouble! This crossed encoding was avoided by adopting a bright yellow color, whch unambiguously means abnormality or caution, to indicate overloads. This illustrates how special characteristics of a specific user group can influence the visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Bus Voltage Encoding</head><p>A workable representation of bus voltage magnitude was more difficult to obtain. Bus voltages are not flows, but can be thought of as height measurements at various points in the power system. This led naturally to the idea of a contour plot, similar to a contour map of a mountainous region. <ref type="figure">(Fig. 7)</ref> Contour plots using contour lines, and the use of colors to identlfy contour regions, were tried. Neither representation seemed to provide a natural encoding. It was difficult to distinguish between h g h points and low points, and Micult to identlfy limit violations. Areas of high or low voltage did not seem to have much physical meaning because they were only vaguely associated with the buses. A three dimensional perspective view of the voltage contour surface, as used in <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>, does make it easy to distinguish between highs and lows, but moves the voltage information even farther from the associated bus, and has unsatisfactory loss of detail for large systems. Furthermore, a clear display of all values in a realistically sized system will require some dynamic element, such as "nodding" of the entire display. This was felt to be unacceptable in an operational environment. Contour mapping was discarded as an encoding technique for bus voltages.</p><p>Perhaps the fundamental reason why contour plots of voltage fail is that they are not fiducial representations of the relationsbps of the encoded data. In a power system, voltage only exists at the bus. The contour plot graphically gives voltage values for points between buses, where no voltage exists, and so misleads the user.</p><p>The next iteration was to identify voltages at each bus in some way local to the bus. The progression of colors adopted was the progression from the natural spectrum, Red, Orange, Yellow, etc. It was thought that most dispatchers would be familiar with this progression. Unfortunately, they are familiar with the acronym, ROYGBIV, and not with the colors themselves. It was not intuitively obvious to a user that yellow was a higher voltage than red. Even with a key, this was not a useful encoding. Gray scale was also tried, with disappointing results. Colorbased encoding of voltages was abandoned. In retrospect, an encoding based on visual temperature (red-yellowwhite) might have been more successful.</p><p>Next, a thermometer approach was tried. The first implementation used a pointer on a vertical scale. <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6a)</ref> The pointer was effective at communicating individual bus voltages, but did not provide a global perspective.</p><p>Users had to focus on each bus in turn to see the voltages.</p><p>A colored bar, however, proved more visible. The bus symbol used was a hollow square. The bottom of the box represented the low voltage limit, and the top of the box the high voltage limit, typically 0.95 and 1.05 per unit. The box was filled with a distinctive color from the bottom up, with the amount of fill proportional to the bus voltage. <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6b</ref>) This allowed easy identification of patterns of voltage in the power system by looking for concentrations of the fill color on the representation. However, only high voltage patterns could be seen. Low voltages which are usually operationally more important, were not as visible.</p><p>To improve task specificity, the box was then filled from the top down. <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6c</ref>) This made low voltages more visible, at the expense of high ones, but it was also counter-intuitive. Humans seem to expect things to fill from the bottom up. In frustration, starting the bar at the midpoint of the outline box was tried. <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6d</ref>) This was a total failure, since high and low voltages had the same amount of color, so no global patterns could be seen, while extracting individual voltages remained confusing.</p><p>The encoding which finally worked combines two approaches, filling the box from the bottom up with one color, and from the top down with a contrasting hue. The bus voltage value is shown by the position of the dividing line between the two colors. <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6e</ref>) As bus voltage increases, the line moves up in the box until it exceeds the limit, where the color outside the limit changes to the violation color and the box is outlined to show that limits are being exceeded. <ref type="figure">(Fig. 69</ref> The colors chosen are blue and green, since they contrast with each other are not used elsewhere on the display.</p><p>The combination of line flow and bus voltage representations has been implemented for the IEEE 118 bus test case <ref type="figure">(Fig. 8)</ref>. The displays were implemented in X-Windows with X-Toolkit and Athena widgets. They have been run on both Sun Sparc and HP workstations. A Visual C++ implementation has also been made.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Assessment</head><p>The developed visualization permits users to "see" the power system in a way that is completely new. Power system state can be taken in at a glance, rather than laboriously extracted from inspection of many different displays, after much user interface manipulation. Rapid identification of problems should permit corrective actions to be taken promptly enough to avert certain types of power system collapses. <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref> shows multiple overloads and bus violations due to a sigruficant load increase. All of the problems, and their relationships, are clear at a glance.</p><p>The visualization also makes power system operating conditions more accessible to non-technical persons such as managers and regulators, and should improve the integration of technical considerations into financial and regulatory decisions.</p><p>Potential future research directions include usability testing to obtain objective measures of the benefits of visualization, integration of visualization into the complex EMS user interface, application of visualization to additional dispatcher tasks, and attention to the planning problem, which may include visualization of power system dynamics.</p></div>			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1070">-2385/94 $04.00 0 1994 IEEE</note>
