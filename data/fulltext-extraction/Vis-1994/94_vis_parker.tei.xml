				<p>One of the most fundamental issues in magnetic fusion research is the understanding of turbulent transport observed in present-day tokamak ezperiments. Plasma turbulence is very challenging from a theoretical point of view due t o the nonlinearity and high dimensionality of the governing equations. Recent developments in algorithms along with the astounding advances in high performance computing now make first-principle particle simulations an important tool for improved understanding of such phenomena. Due to the five dimensional phase space (3 spatial, 2 velocity) and complez toroidal geometry, visualization is crucial for interpreting such simulation data. This paper discusses how visualization tools are currently used and what new physics has been elucidated, along with what can be learned about tokamak turbulence through the interplay between theory, simulation and visualization.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>A continuing national priority is the timely and economical development of magnetic fusion energy. Present day experiments, called "tokamaks" are producing fusion output power comparable to the input power needed to heat and sustain the tokamak plasma which operates a t temperatures hotter than our sun. One of the most fundamental issues in magnetic fusion research is the understanding of turbulent transport phenomena observed in present-day tokamaks. This is because it is the "turbulent transport" which causes particles and energy to escape the confining magnetic fields. Plasma turbulence is very challenging from a theoretical point of view due to the nonlinearity and high dimensionality of the governing equations. In addition, experimental measurements of fluctuations in the core region of a tokamak are very difficult due the extremely high temperatures 2 10 keV. Thus, numerical simulation plays an important role to gain better understanding of core plasma transport. A pre-</p></div>

To this end, a three dimensional (five dimensional phase space) toroidal gyrokinetic particle simulation for the study tokamak turbulence has been developed <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>. The gyrokinetic equations are a reduced set of equations derived from the Vlasov-Maxwell equations by phase averaging over the ion gyromotion, and keeping only the time and space scales relevant for describing tokamak plasmas[2, 31. These large-scale simulations in complex geometry can produce gigabytes of data which consists of large three dimensional arrays evolving in time. Visualization then plays a critical role in going from the "raw" nonlinear solution of these complex equations to a simplified theoretical model explaining the essential underlying physics. Most visualization is done using AVS or SGI Explorer with specialized modules and networks (or maps). Slicing the 3D data sets in various ways, isosurface rendering, animations, spectral data, etc. are all used regularly to make sense out of the large and complex simulation data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Case-Study Results</head><p>Gyrokinetic equations are analogous to Maxwell's equations and Newton's force law commonly solved using particle-in-cell simulation techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, but with unimportant fine spatial and temporal scales formally removed. The equations are solved using a nonlinear characteristic method which evolves the perturbed distribution function along particle trajectories, thus greatly reducing the number of particles needed in the simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The 3D toroidal gyrokinetic particle simulation runs efficiently on a massively parallel supercomputer, a 1024 node Thinking Machines Corporation Connection Machine 5 a t the Advanced Computing Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory. Efficient and scalable particle-in-cell algorithms have been developed using data-parallel programming.</p><p>A typical run uses a 256x256~128 grid and 8 million particles on 512 nodes of the CM-5. Currently, on the CM-5 we are limited to simulating a tokamak with a minor radius of approximately 300 ion gyroradii. We have had considerable success modeling toroidal ion temperature gradient driven microturbulence in tokamak plasmas. Results confirm the radially elongated ballooning mode structure predicted by linear theory, and more importantly show the nonlinear saturation of these toroidal modes. The ensuing turbulent spectrum retains remnants of the linear mode structure <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref> and has very similar features as recent experimental fluctuation measurements using both beam emission spectroscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and reflectometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. This is the first agreement between experimental core fluctuation measurements and large-scale nonlinear simulation, and is very encouraging, even though the physics model is highly idealized (no impurities, collisions, edge effects, etc.). For this problem, the system is assumed electrostatic (i.e. no magnetic field perturbations), the full ion gyrokinetic equation is solved, and the electrons are assumed adiabatic (i.e. the electron mass can be neglected).  <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> (see color plates). A coherent linear structure grows from initial noise exponentially in time and rotates with a constant phase velocity in the poloidal direction (A). As nonlinearities become important, the structure becomes more elongated in the radial direction (B-C), then later these elongated structures themselves become unstable, and a transition to the turbulent stationary state occurs (D). Through 3 0 visualization we observed that the radial structure becomes more elongated during nonlinear saturation then quickly rips apart. To easily identify this effect, a animation of the poloidal slice is needed. The theoretical explanation for this effect is that there is nonlinear coupling of energy to adjacent rational surfaces, away from the region with the strong temperature gradient.</p><p>An additional effect, incorporated in to the physical model, is the turbulent self-generation of shear flows. The "shear flow mode" consists of a radial electric field which is constant poloidally and toroidally. The shear flow (a result of the ExB drift), has a quenching effect on the turbulence reducing the heat transport. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2(a-d)</ref> show the corresponding poloidal slices of @ sequentially in time during the nonlinear saturation with shear flow effects. In the steady state, the radial shear flow mode dominates. We will use visualization to help identify the physical mechanism responsible for the transition to this fairly coherent state.</p><p>In addition to global simulations of the whole tokamak plasma volume, we have developed a second model which simulates a small radial and poloidal slice or a flux tube volume element. This domain is chosen to simulate the minimum plasma volume necessary and still capture the relevant physics <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. The coordinate system is aligned with the magnetic field lines, as is the turbulence, permitting use of a coarse grid in the field line direction. These "field-line-following" coordinates are nonorthogonal and get quite twisted when moving along the magnetic field lines, hence 3D visualization becomes essential in interpreting the results in real space. <ref type="figure">Figure 4(a-c)</ref> shows the whole tokamak global simulation domain, the local flux-tube domain, and the local flux-tube domain within the global domain respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future Work</head><p>Future work will include incorporating more physics details such as an improved electron model with a trapped component, and the effect of magnetic perturbations. We plan to make greater use of visualization and quantification to improve our understanding of the simulation data, for example using juxtaposition to gain insight in to the relation between the pressure and @ which produce the heat transport. Another area of interest is studying wave particle interactions which may be large contributors to transport.. To better understand this mechanism we plan to juxtapose the 3D field fluctuations and the particle trajectories.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure l(a-d) show results from the 3D toroidal gyrokinetic simulation of an ion temperature gradient driven instability.
