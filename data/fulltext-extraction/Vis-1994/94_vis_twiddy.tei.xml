				<p>Pseudocoloring is a frequently used technique in scientific visualization for mapping a color to a data value. When using pseudocolor and animation to visualize data that contain missing regions displayed as black or transparent, the missing regions popping in and out can distract the viewer from the more relevant information. Filling these gaps with interpolated data could lead to a misinterpretation of the data. This paper presents a method for combining pseudocoloring and grayscale in the same colormap. Valid data are mapped to colors in the colormap. The luminance values of the colors bounding areas of missing data are used in interpolating over these regions. The missing data are mapped to the grayscale portion of the colormap. This approach has the advantages of eliminating distracting gaps caused by missing data and distinguishing between those areas that represent valid data and those areas that do not. This approach was inspired by a technique used in the restoration of paintings.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Art Restoration</head><p>In art the term restoration refers to " ... the replacement of missing parts and the filling in of missing areas in a damaged work of art." <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref> In his book The Materials of the Artist &amp; their Use in Painting, Max Doerner states: "In the case of valuable works it is best not to attempt corrections, additions, or overpainting, but rather to maintain the faulty areas in a neutral color tone which harmonizes with the general tone of the painting.</p><p>The restorer in such cases should not glory in his skill in making his additions appear to be parts of the original."</p><p>[2] Restorers who believe that only the original paint is permissible, use neutral tones to retouch the damaged areas to minimize interference with the aesthetic appreciation of the painting. This approach is not without controversy and there are those in the art world who favor an approach to retouching that deceives the viewer completely.</p><p>[3]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Data Restoration</head><p>A similar controversy exists in the realm of scientific visualization. There are those who believe that missing data should be indicated either by mapping to a color outside the valid data domain or by making those areas completely transparent. Others believe in applying some method of interpolation that smoothes over the areas of missing data. Although the latter approach has the advantage of eliminating distracting gaps caused by missing data, it does not distinguish between valid data and interpolated data. The approach we present uses luminance interpolation to visually blend the missing data with the valid data while at the same time distinguishing missing data areas by their lack of color.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Visual Perception</head><p>In the process of seeing, we are dependent on observing the interactive juxtaposition of gradations of tone from brightness (or lightness) to darkness. The presence or absence of color does not affect tonal values. Tonal values are constant and are infinitely more important than color in seeing. The contrast of tone enables us to see patterns that we can simplify into objects with shape, dimension, and texture. <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> The term brightness is used to refer to the quantity of light in the psychological sense of perceived intensity. The terms luminance and intensity refer to the amount of light energy reflected or emitted from a surface. The perception of brightness depends upon the sensitivity of the eye. The perception of changes in intensity is nonlinear. For example, if you cycle through the settings on a three-way 50-100-150-watt light bulb, the step between 50 to 100 seems much greater than the step between 100 to 150. <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> Our perception of brightness of objects often depends upon the luminance of adjacent objects. This perceptual effect is called simultaneous brightness contrast. This effect can be seen when gray squares of the same luminance are displayed on gray backgrounds that are lighter and darker (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). On the lighter background the gray appears darker and on the darker background it appears lighter.</p><p>Simultaneous color contrast is the effect in the visual system when the perception of a color in an area is influenced by the colors of the adjacent areas. For example, a gray square surrounded by red will be perceived as tinted green. <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> Figure 1: When two gray squares of equal luminance are placed on a background of varying luminance, the square on the lighter background appears darker and the square on the darker background appears lighter.</p><p>The Restorer technique reduces the effect of simultaneous brightness contrast by matching the luminance of the grays used to fill a missing data region to the luminance of the adjacent colors (see Plate 1). The effect of simultaneous color contrast is largely dependent upon the saturation of the colors selected for the palette. Studies by C. <ref type="bibr">Ware [7]</ref> show a colormap based on the physical spectrum (red+blue, blue, blue+green, green, green+red, red) offers minimal contrast distortion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Selecting a Color Palette</head><p>There are many sources of information on the use of color for aesthetic purposes <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> and for coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">13]</ref>. Although selecting a color palette based upon constant lightness or value is one of the preferred methods for providing color harmony, it is not recommended in this case. A palette based upon light and dark contrasts takes advantage of the fact that the eye is more sensitive to spatial variation in intensity than spatial variation in chromaticity. A palette based upon the physical spectrum with variation in lightness provides both aesthetic harmony and extends the range for coding. Our technique was chosen to compensate for situations where colors vary greatly in lightness or value. It is based upon matching each color in the palette to a gray of equal luminance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Restorer Technique</head><p>The Restorer technique fills in missing data regions so that the images can either be used in an animation without distracting gaps, or studied individually with the missing data regions easily distinguishable. Hence, Restorer was designed to satisfy three main considerations in filling missing data areas: to match the luminance of the adjacent colors, to provide stability for consistency, and to provide a unique fill solution.</p><p>By matching the luminance at the boundary, the fill will be least intrusive in viewing data sets using a palette with large variations in luminance. The luminance associated with a color is dependent on the display device. In the cases treated so far, we are dealing with the National Television System Committee (NTSC) standard, as discussed in <ref type="bibr">Foley,</ref><ref type="bibr">et a1 [14]</ref>. The luminance (Y) for NTSC is calculated from the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components of the color by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Y = 0.30 R + 0.59 G + 0.11 B.</formula><p>Since the filled area should not distract the viewer in an animation, it should be fairly consistent from one frame to the next while still following the shape of the data. In a stable fill algorithm, small changes in the luminance in the vicinity of the missing data will cause only small changes in the fill. Uniqueness implies that there should be only one fill that would result from the algorithm.</p><p>In each of the fill algorithms that will be discussed, the input consists of a two-dimensional array containing the valid data, a two-dimensional array marking the <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(See color plates, page CP-23.)</ref> missing data, and a colormap. In some implementations, this can be a single pseudocolored image with the missing data marked by a unique color. The algorithms will be applied only to the regions of the image where the data is missing and will leave the valid regions undisturbed. In each case a neutral gray is added into the image, with the luminance of the gray determined by the algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Laplacian Fill</head><p>In the Laplacian Fill Algorithm, the luminance, Y, in the interior of the missing data regions, is a solution of Laplace's equation, v2 Y(x,y) = 0, and it matches the luminance of the adjacent valid data. The general property of Laplace's equation is that it will not have a maximum or minimum in the region. It will also tend to average the luminance of the interior, giving more weight to the near edges. It has the advantage that some structures are continued across the missing areas. This solution will satisfy all of the three conditions stated earlier. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> The Laplacian Fill Algorithm was implemented using the Gauss-Seidel algorithm [ 161 for computing the luminance. The method converged rapidly because the luminance was represented by a byte array and, generally, the missing areas were small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Rank Fill</head><p>The Rank Fill Algorithm applies multiple rank filters to the missing data. The rank filter is a convolution process by which the value of a function at a point is replaced with the maximum value found anywhere within the small defined region or kernel. This filter will not affect a function within a region where the function is uniform or slowly varying. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> In order to implement the Rank Fill Algorithm, a network of modules was generated using IRIS Explorer on a Silicon Graphics Workstation. The functionality of the network as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> is separated into three categories: Data Input Modules, Filtering Modules, and Overlay (Filling) Modules.</p><p>The Data Input Modules read the physical data and convert them into Explorer data format. For threedimensional data, the OrthoSlice Module is used to extract two-dimensional slices. A colormap is applied to the data and a pseudocolor image is generated.</p><p>The Filtering Modules generate a grayscale image of the pseudocolor image and apply two rank filters with rank levels of 8 and 6, respectively. The result is then passed through a median filter. The rank filters extend the luminance of the data in the vicinity of the edges into the missing areas, and the median filter smoothes the luminance in the interior regions. In effect, a unique luminance is generated for the image that covers the missing areas consistent with the luminance of the data bounding these regions.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modified Rank Fill</head><p>completed using the Laplacian Fill (see Plate 4c).</p><p>The Modified Rank Fill is a combination of the Rank Fill and the Laplacian Fill. In some cases, the missing data regions are too large for the Rank Fill Algorithm to completely fill. In these cases, the output from the Rank Fill Algorithm is used as input to the Laplacian Fill Algorithm in order to fill the remaining areas of the missing data regions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head><p>The technique discussed in this paper has been applied to several test cases and to atmospheric data sets that contain missing data. In Plate 2a a test chart of saturated squares of red, green, blue, and yellow provides a background for a black linear pattern representing missing data. Plate 2b shows the result of the Restoration technique, using the Laplacian Fill. In order to evaluate the results shown in Plate 2b, the color image was converted to a grayscale image and is shown in Plate 2c. Restorer was completely successful in areas where black was surrounded by a single hue. In those areas where black overlapped two or four hues of contrasting luminance, the technique was less successful and we see a blurring of the gray values as it attempts to interpret the contour of the underlying colored squares.</p><p>The second test illustrates the ability of Restorer to reduce the distractions caused by missing data when dynamically slicing through a three-dimensional data set. Plate 3 shows images from an animation sequence in which three geometric shapes (a triangle, a square, and a circle) were placed at fixed positions to indicate missing data in a data set which contained no missing data. As the cutting plane moves through the data in the first animation sequence, the black shapes appear to float in front of the data while the shapes, restored by the Laplacian Fill, blend with the background. In the next animation sequence, Restorer eliminates the distractions caused when the black shapes appear randomly, popping in and out of the scene.</p><p>Restorer was next applied to global column ozone data collected by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) on Nimbus-7 for the period January 1, 1992, through April 30, 1993. Plate 4 illustrates the three basic steps in the Restoration process to fill the missing areas. The original data is shown in Plate 4a. Plate 4b shows the result of using the rank and median filters that correctly fill for most cases. In this instance'the area was too large for the rank and median filters, so it was</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper we have presented a method for filling regions of missing data by using the luminance of the colors representing valid data in the neighborhood of the missing data. The method has the advantages of visually blending the restored areas with the original data while remaining distinguishable upon closer inspection. This approach successfully eliminates distracting gaps when viewing images in an animation.</p><p>The Laplacian fill was found to be adequate for filling areas where the luminance varies monotonically across the missing regions. For example, the fills shown in the geometric shapes in Plate 3 reduce the distractions while still marking the missing data regions. In cases similar to the one illustrated in Plate 4, where a narrow missing region extends between two bright areas across a dark belt, the Laplacian Fill Algorithm gives an unacceptably bright fill. The luminance at the center of the fill was approximately the average of the luminance of the bright and dark regions. Because of the nonlinearity in visual perception of intensity, the filled region seemed much brighter than the dark band and not significantly dimmer than the bright bands.</p><p>The Rank Fill was developed to restore images with the pathologies just described. Like the Laplacian Fill, the Rank Fill will fill small areas with the average of the surrounding luminance. However, in the case of the long narrow region described above, the luminance value assigned to the center of the region is determined by the luminance of the nearest valid data on the left and right sides. This maintains the pattern of luminance in the original data.</p><p>The rank filter in the Rank Fill Algorithm can be applied several times to completely fill the missing data regions. Experimentation with the number of iterations has shown that if it is applied more than five times, the luminance will converge to the highest value of the full image. The result is that the fill will not meet the criteria of matching the luminance of the adjacent valid data. In these cases, the Laplacian Fill Algorithm is used to complete the fill.</p><p>It is our intention to further investigate the limitations of the rank filter after two repetitions. Currently, the number of repetitions is based upon visual inspection of the missing data regions and the convergence (See color plates, page  of the grayscale with the boundaries of these areas. Ideally, we would like to automate this process so that the number of rank filters applied to the missing regions would be determined by a complete fill of all the missing areas. Another option that is being added to Restorer is to derive the luminance of the missing data areas in a twodimensional slice by interpolating the luminance of the slices adjacent to it. We also intend to apply the Restorer technique to other types of physical data such as oceanography, wind, and fluid flow data sets.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>A block diagram of data flow using rank filters and a median filter applied to the missing regions.
