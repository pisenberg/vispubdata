				<p>An important issue in scientific visualization systems is the management of data sets. Most data sets in scientific visualization, whether created by measurement or simulation, are usually voluminous. The goal of data management is to reduce the storage space and the access time of these data sets to speed up the visualization process. A new progressive transmission scheme using spline biorthogonal wavelet bases is proposed in this papel: By exploiting the properties of this set of wavelet bases, a fast algorithm involving only additions and subtractions is developed. Due to the multiresolutional nature of the wavelet transform, this scheme is compatible with hierarchical-structured rendering algorithms. The formula for reconstructing the functional values in a continuous volume space is given in a simple polynomial form. Lossless compression is possible, even when using jloating-point numbers. This algorithm has been applied to data from a global ocean model. The lossless compression ratio is about 1.5:l. With a compression ratio of 50:I, the reconstructed data is still of good quality. Several other wavelet bases are compared with the spline biorthogonal wavelet bases. Finally, the reconstructed data is visualized using various algorithms and the results are demonstrated.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Progressive transmission is a good framework for data management in scientific visualization when a large volume of data is involved. The principle is to transmit the least amount of data necessary to generate a usable approximation of the original data. If the user requires further refinement, more data is fetched into the memory and a higher-resolution data set is reconstructed. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>.</p><p>Progressive transmission algorithms based on the DCT, tree-structured pyramids, bit plane techniques, etc., have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Blandford</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> presented a scheme based on a 8-tap discrete wavelet transform (WT) and concluded it was very suitable for progressive transmission in the case of non-uniform resolution. Muraki <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> applied the truncated version of Battle-Lemarit wavelets to volume data and proposed a fast superposition algorithm for reconstruction of functional values in continuous space. However, there are still some unsolved problems. Most transformbased approaches slow down the system performance by introducing a time-consuming decoding procedure. This greatly limits their value in applications with strict speed requirements. In most visualization techniques such as isosurface rendering and fluid topology extraction, the functional values in the continuous space must be calculated conveniently. By using an infinitely supported function as the superposition basis, a complex approximation algorithm has to be utilized. Another drawback is that since most low bit-rate algorithms use transforms such as the DCT or WT, lossless data compression is difficult because the denominators of the coefficients often are not in the form of 2" .</p><p>In this paper, a scheme based on the biorthogonal spline wavelet transform is proposed. The lengths of all filters are less than 6. Experimental results indicate that they perform better in most cases than a family of optimized &amp;tap wavelet bases where the same filter is used in both the decomposition and the reconstruction sides. Because all the filter coefficients are dyadic rationals, multiplication and division operations can be simplified to addition and subtraction for floating-point numbers or to shifting for integer numbers. This makes the transform much faster. This property also makes lossless coding possible. In the case of the biorthogonal wavelet, symmetry is more easily achieved, resulting in a better handling of the data boundary. Because the transform basis functions are compactly supported and can be explicitly formulated in a polynomial form, the reconstruction of function values from wavelet transform coefficients is much easier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Method</head><p>Basically, the scheme illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> contains four steps. The wavelet transform and entropy coding, the entropy decoding and inverse wavelet transform, the refinement strategy and the rendering algorithm. Since sophisticated methods for entropy coding and refinement control exist </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Biorthogonal Wavelet Wansform</head><p>Because of its multiresolutional nature, the wavelet transform is very suitable for hierarchical manipulations such as progressive data transmission and tree-structured graphics rendering. A simple WT decomposition and reconstruction scheme [4] using quadrature mirror filters (QMF) is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>Suppose that cj-l is the original input at a given resolution level j -1. In the decomposition stage, data are convoluted with a pair of filters Eand S. Eis often a lowpass filter while gis often a high-pass filter. As a result, the c' can be viewed as a coarser approximation of c j -l . By downsampling the filtered data, the total number of samples in level j is the same as that of level j -1. This procedure can be repeated several times. After reconstruction, the final result t'-' is identical to c J -I . g is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">gn = ( -l ) " h -n + I (1)</formula><p>There are many families of wavelet bases with reasonable decay both in the time and the frequency domain. To guarantee perfect reconstruction (PR), the filter can not be truncated. This implies that the wavelet basis must be compactly supported. Also, to more easily deal with the data boundary, symmetric bases are preferred. However, it is well known from wavelet theory that symmetry and perfect reconstruction are incompatible if we use the transform in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>. This difficulty can be overcome by using the biorthogonal wavelet transform [l], which is diagrammed in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>.    <ref type="table">Table I</ref> gives some example bases of this family. &amp;z) and H(z) are z-transforms of h and h. Notice that the denominators of the coefficients are all in the form 2". This property makes them good candidates for our application. There is still some freedom left to choose bases from this family depending on implementation requirements. One basic principle is if a set of longer bases is used, the frequency separation property of h and g will be better , but at the expenses of more computational complexity and a lower lossless compression ratio. operation is needed. This fact was exploited to develop a multiplication-free WT algorithm. Our application involves rendering the data from eighteen 75 MB data files simultaneously. For efficient visualization, the inverse wavelet transform must be very fast. A system using the wavelet bases in <ref type="table">Table I</ref> with k = 2 and k = 2 has been implemented. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4</ref> shows the scale function $(x) and the wavelet function $(x).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">H(t)fi(t) = COS(t/2)*' ' r 1 '2 (' -2 . -I-"). sin(t/2)'" 4-sin(t/2)"R(() (3)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">--z' -_ 3z' + z</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Fast Wavelet Transform</head><p>The efficient wavelet transform method introduced by Mallat <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> borrowed the QMF scheme from subband coding theory <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2)</ref>. In this algorithm, the major computational burden is caused by the convolution operation which involves a lot of floating-point multiplication. Because h, h, g and g are all symmetric in our scheme, the number of multiplications can be reduced by approximately 50%. After investigating the IEEE standard-floating point data format <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 5 )</ref> , it was found that for a floating-point number, multiplication by 2" can be simplified to the addition of n to the exponent, while for an integer number only a shift </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Superposition</head><p>To combine a progressive transmission scheme with a visualization algorithm such as isosurface generation or ray casting, the functional values in the continuous volume must be approximated efficiently from the transform coefficients. In a general 1-D case, if the WT with = 2 and k = 2 is used, the function value at x can be reconstructed using the following formula: This suggests that the exact function value at any real x can be computed through linear interpolation of the function values at the two discrete neighbors which surround x. In this case, the resulted f ( x ) is C 0 continuous. When the order of $(x) and $ ( . ) is larger than 1, we can still write <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> in a closed polynomial form with order of k -1. f ( x ) will be C i -2 continuous. If we simply take the tensor product of the one-dimension bases as the bases for the multidimension WT, the same conclusion can be derived.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Lossless Compression is Possible</head><p>IEEE single-precision floating-point numbers have 23+1 bits of precision. Multiplication by 2" will require no extra bit to retain the same precision. However, addition may result in some extra bits. As an example, consider the WT in our scheme. For E, the convolution formula is:</p><p>Where f, is the discrete input function value. Suppose the maximum and minimum exponents of all five f, values are pmx and Pmin. Then the maximum number of extra bits we need to record the precise c, is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">- b, = P,, -Pmin + 3 (7)</formula><p>Similarly, for h, the maximum number of extra bits needed is no more than:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">be = P,, -P,, + 2 (8)</formula><p>This is the worst case. Usually Fe and b, are less than the value given here. To increase the lossless compression ratio, the fewest extra bits for each coefficient in the transform domain is desired. Recording the information about extra bits using an oct-tree has produced good results.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>We applied the scheme described in this paper to Ocean model data <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The model output was available on a 337 X 468 X 6 grid 120 times per year. Layer thickness and current data in floating-point formatvariables from the modelwere used in our experiments. Each of the six time-varying layers were considered separately, the top layer being of greatest interest.</p><p>First, we compared the spline biorthogonal wavelet transform with a family of 6-tap WTs where all hi are functions of two parametersa and fiaccording to the formulae in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(9)</ref>. Several 1-D signal sequences with 120 samples were randomly chosen from the ocean model data set. parameter space for the minimum MSE and compared it with the MSE generated by the spline biorthogonal wavelet compression algorithm. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table II</ref> gives the results of some typical signals in our application. From these data, we concluded that although the lengths of the spline biorthogonal WT filters are less than 6, they perform the same or better than the optimized &amp;tap WTs in a scheme where both forward and inverse transforms use the same filters. To apply the biorthogonal WT to our data set, the boundary conditions had to be considered. In each frame (timestep) of Ocean model data, valid function values were only available within the ocean area <ref type="figure">(Fig. 7a)</ref>. This area was constant over time. A 2-D WT requires the ocean area be approximated using square blocks. The blocksize used was 2" X 2", where n was larger than the level of the WT in each data frame. The approximated Ocean area had to cover the entire original ocean area <ref type="figure">(Fig. 7b</ref>). For grid points in the approximated ocean area but not in the original area, interpolation and extrapolation techniques were used to yield function values. This introduced some discontinuity at the data boundary. In our implementation, second order Lagrange interpolation was used. Since all our WT bases are symmetric, the function values outside the boundary were achieved simply by reflection.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 8</ref>, after applying the transform twice in each spatial dimension in a frame and once in the temporal dimension, only 1/32 of the transform coefficients were transmitted to the decoder. The reconstructed data had good quality and met the requirements of further scientific visualization processes. By using the refinement control strategy proposed by Blandford <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, only a small amount of data was needed for a better reconstruction.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>, layer thickness, which is a scalar field, compressed by our algorithm at the rate of 50: 1 is shown. For Streamlines are generated both for the original field and the field reconstructed using only 1/32 of WT coefficients, the results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">I +-464 4 ' t</formula><p>Applying a topology extraction algorithm <ref type="bibr">[IO]</ref> to this vector field, the global and the stable topology structures remained relatively unchanged, even at a 16: 1 compression ratio. With progressive refinement, more and more local and unstable features can be extracted <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 11)</ref>. This can be explained as the low-pass effects of the WT.</p><p>The decoding speed, an important factor in interactive visualization system, is about 10 framslsec on an SGI Indi-go2 machine. This satisfies the need of fast volume rendering in our application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions and Future works</head><p>A new scheme of progressive transmission using a spline biorthogonal wavelet transform is proposed in this paper. This family of wavelet base functions is symmetric, compactly supported, and the QMF coefficients are dyadic rationals. These attractive features make this scheme advantageous in several aspects. The transform itself is fast and high compression ratios can be achieved. The reconstructed data is of good quality and can be refined with a small amount of additional data. Data boundaries can be tackled gracefully, The reconstruction of function values in continuous space from the WT coefficients is a simple polynomial. This interesting property is especially useful for scientific visualization applications.</p><p>Future work includes more investigation of the WT's effects on the topology of the flow field, combining this algorithm with some other hierarchical scientific visualiza-tion techniques, and constructing better wavelet bases.</p></div>
