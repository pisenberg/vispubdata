				<p>Visual exploration and analysis is a process of discovering and dissecting the abundant and complex attribute relationships that pervade multidimensional data. Recent research has identified and characterized patterns of multiple coordinated views, such as crossfiltered views, in which rapid sequences of simple interactions can be used to express queries on subsets of attribute values. In visualizations designed around these patterns, for the most part, distinct views serve to visually isolate each attribute from the others. Although the brush-and-click simplicity of visual isolation facilitates discovery of many-to-many relationships between attributes, dissecting these relationships into more fine-grained one-to-many relationships is interactively tedious and, worse, visually fragmented over prolonged sequences of queries. This paper describes: (1) a method for interactively dissecting multidimensional data by iteratively slicing and manipulating a multigraph representation of data values and value co-occurrences; and (2) design strategies for extending the construction of coordinated multiple view interfaces for dissection as well as discovery of attribute relationships in multidimensional data sets. Using examples from different domains, we describe how attribute relationship graphs can be combined with cross-filtered views, modularized for reuse across designs, and integrated into broader visual analysis tools. The exploratory and analytic utility of these examples suggests that an attribute relationship graph would be a useful addition to a wide variety of visual analysis tools.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Many data sets of interest in visual analytics <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> come in the form of one or more multidimensional relational tables. These data sets often include a mix of geospatial, temporal, numerical, and categorical information. Nonetheless, they tend to be predominantly nominal in nature, consisting of multiple dimensions of people, places, events, institutions, things, ideas, and other kinds of named entities and groups that represent the who and the what of social, political, legal, educational, financial, and other complex human systems.</p><p>Graph visualization has become an extraordinarily popular means to explore and analyze the many relationships that exist between the entities and groups in such systems. Our comprehension of the world around us, from the material to the conceptual, is highly associative. Consequently, the information representations into which we map our understanding of the world tend to be full of relationships, even if those relationships are not always explicit in data. Graph visualization is effective because it can explicitly represent many-to-many relationships in perceptually immediate, cognitively direct, and interactively accessible ways. The visualization * e-mail: weaver@cs.ou.edu community continues to develop many useful and usable techniques for displaying and interacting with objects and their relationships. The real challenge, however, lies in providing ways to deeply explore and analyze the often tangled web of implicit relationships that the complex human processes of naming and measurement and organization infuse into every seemingly mundane data set.</p><p>With visualization as a discipline continuing to mature from craft to science, there is increasing interest in discovering patterns and pathways for synthesizing "visual-interactive compounds" that are demonstrably useful for data exploration and analysis in both broad and targeted applications. This paper describes one such pattern, attribute relationship graphs, that allows analysts to dissect multidimensional relationships by both drilling down into and slicing across attributes in order to expose the many-to-many details of attribute value co-occurrences spread across one or more data sets.</p><p>Attribute relationship graphs extend the cross-filtered views technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> by adding a node-edge-hyperedge diagram that supports flexible exploration of attribute value co-occurrences across two or more columns of tabular data, using a multigraph representation. This representation can be interactively filtered on a selection of columns as well as on selections of arbitrary subsets of values in those columns-essentially a fully filterable mapping of the top two levels of an N-dimensional data cube into nodes, edges, and hyperedges (visually encoding the latter as node-containing packs).</p><p>The general structure of a typical attribute relationship graph design consists of well-known visualization components: dimensionally appropriate views for brushing the unique values of each attribute; checkboxes for toggling filtering between any directed pair of these views; a graph view that shows values and value cooccurrences; and checkboxes that toggle filtering of nodes for each attribute, edges for each undirected attribute pair, and hyperedges for each directed attribute pair. This structure supports a process in which trained analysts can follow complex lines of inquiry by using sequences of simple, freely interleaved interactions to perform specific visual data exploration and analysis tasks.</p><p>We start by describing an example in which an attribute relationship graph is used for visual exploration of recent award-winning movies in the Internet Movie Database. After summarizing related work on multidimensional visual data analysis and graph visualization, we describe the attribute relationship graph technique and a general method for designing visualizations of tabular data sets using it. Using additional examples from two other data domains, we proceed to describe how attribute relationship graphs can be flexibly customized with respect to data types across multiple dimensions, incorporated into more wide-ranging multiple view designs, and modularized for reuse across designs. We conclude by considering analytic utility and usability in terms of the perceptual and interactive characteristics of the graph view as an extension of crossfiltering, practical restrictions on query expressiveness, scalability and interactive performance, and future directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">EXAMPLE: CINEGRAPH</head><p>The Internet Movie Database (IMDB) is a popular web site for browsing and searching information about movies, including the actors and crew members who make them, the genres they belong to, when they were released to theaters, the awards they have won, The attribute relationship graph shows correspondences between awards and award-winning movies that took in less than $100M at the box office. The graph simultaneously shows that only one person involved with at least one of these movies has been both a director and a cinematographer, although not necessarily of the award winners. and the ratings that online fans have given them. This large and complex mix of social, attitudinal, relational, and temporal data is strongly analogous to many data sets of central interest in visual analytics. Moreover, popular interest in and familiarity with movies makes exploration and analysis of IMDB an exemplary target for more broadly accessible applications of new visualization methods. However, current tools typically allow users to ask at most a few canned questions about two or three dimensions of the data, typically with interactive manipulation of only one of those dimensions.</p><p>Open-ended exploration also demands visual tools and techniques that can handle not only a broad range of data volumes, but also an increasingly large number of interrelated data dimensions that involve a rich mix of data types with complex, domain-specific semantics. The IMDB subset created for the InfoVis 2007 contest, for instance, describes only mainstream movies from 2001 to 2007, yet occupies four tables that contain 20204 records about movies, ratings, and release dates, 246755 records about people and roles, 35384 records about genres, and 43 records about awards, respectively. Movies typically have ten or more people, many of whom fill multiple roles, and three or more genres. However, the distribution of data value occurrences and many-to-many relationships varies extremely. Exploring data of this sort requires simultaneous agility, flexibility, expressiveness, and expansiveness of interaction.</p><p>We used Improvise <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> to develop Cinegraph <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, an interactive visual tool for exploring and analyzing the IMDB subset. The tool maps nine attributes of the movies database-movies, genres, people, roles, awards, release dates, average ratings, number of ratings, and box office totals-into a collection of multiple coordinated views laid out in a single-window user interface ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1)</ref>. A scatter plot matrix displays the rating count, rating average, and box office attributes together, each plotted against the other two, as a single ratings "dimension". A calendar shows release dates. The remaining five attributes populate table views. Cross-filtering connects these dimensions, allowing users to drill-down by turning on and off brushing of arbitrary sets of data values in those dimensions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows an example of one point in an exploration of awards. After (A) selecting all awards, the user (B) filters genres, movies, people, and roles on awards to get a general sense of the number, distribution, and specific instances of "winners" in each of these dimensions. Being particularly interested in cinematographers and directors, the user (C) selects these two roles, then (D) further filters people on roles. Wondering which people have filled which roles, the user (E) turns on both kinds of nodes in the attribute relationship graph, then (F) the edges that connect them, revealing that (G) only Steven Soderbergh has been both a director and a cinematographer in an award-winning movie. Turning on (H) packs around people for each role shows this even more clearly. Now curious about relatively low-budget movies, the user (I) turns on filtering of movies by rating, then (J) rubberbands to ultimately select movies that made less than $100M at the box office; the movies table view (K) dynamically updates during the navigation. Turning on (L) movie and award nodes, then (M) packs of movies for each award, the user can see which movies have some award in common, but not which one. Turning on (N) edges reveals the many-to-many relationships between movies and awards, including that (O) Mystic River won awards for both leading actor and supporting actor, but that (P) none of the selected movies has won best picture. Using the attribute relationship graph, the user can drill into arbitrary subsets of movies, people, and their characteristics, then slice across attributes to dissect many-to-many details about kinds of movies, groups of people, and even patterns of moviemaking over time. As a result, the user can explore local regions of complex associations between attribute values much more efficiently than through exhaustive sequential construction of the one-to-many visual states that are frequently required using a cross-filtered design alone. Furthermore, like cross-filtering, attribute relationship graphs generalize well to tabular data formats and thus appear suitable for template-based rapid visualization design. Nevertheless, Cinegraph was designed and built by hand and applied to the In-foVis 2007 contest data set in under a week, with only two days needed for live design including implementation of both crossfiltering and the attribute relationship graph in seven dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RELATED WORK</head><p>Attributed relational graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> have long been used for defining visual languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Visualization of attributed relational data has also been noted as important <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, but has been largely overlooked from a systematic perspective, despite many examples of domainspecific visual tools that include some sort of interactive multigraph representation. We make an important distinction between attributed relational graphs (also known as attributed graphs), in which an object is related to its attributes (characteristics) through directed edges, and an attribute relationship graph, in which the values of database attributes (column values) are related through undirected edges that indicate co-occurrences in records. This distinction is tricky when one interprets each data record to be a collective description of some attributed object. We focus on co-occurrences between attributes rather than between an entire record and its attributes. This difference has a profound impact on the data transformations, visual representations, and ultimately analytic utility of attribute relationship graphs. (In this paper, we use "attribute relationship graph" to denote both the design pattern and its instances.)</p><p>Well-known graph visualization toolkits, such as GraphViz <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and JUNG <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, provide extensive options for reading, drawing, and navigating graphs in a scalable manner. These toolkits can be used to define topology, encode data values, support spatial navigation and selection, and perform dynamic layout. Interactive manipulation of graphs remains largely limited to interaction in graphs, including panning, zooming, rotation, brushing of nodes, expand/collapse of subgraphs, and automatic and manual layout <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. The CGV system <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> provides a comprehensive set of such interaction and filtering capabilities, including basic coordination of attributed graphs with other views. The visual representation of graphs has also been considered in terms of a pipeline of data transformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. The InfoVis Toolkit <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and prefuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> used flattened tabular representations of graphs and trees, thereby unifying the transformations used for graph views and other views under the data state model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. However, these approaches provide at most a few fixed entry points for introducing prescribed kinds of coordinated interaction into the transformation pipeline, making them well-suited for visualizing graphs but less so for general use in multiple coordinated view designs.</p><p>Multiple coordinated view visualizations draws on a variety of design patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, some general <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and some specific to visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. A variety of classic and recent visual analysis tools use multiple coordinated views to support drill-down into relationships in data, using multidimensional brushing in scatter plot matrices in XmdvTool <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, interactively filtering of a central view by selecting subranges of data attribute values in sliders in Spotfire <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, attribute aggregation polyarchies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, elastic hierarchies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, ranking in social network graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, ontologically annotated semantic graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, a hybrid of node-edge diagrams and matrices in Node-Trix <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and combinations of parallel coordinate plots with nodeedge diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and cross-linked space-filling hierarchies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In developing attribute relationships graphs, we are interested not only in adding to the space of existing multidimensional visual analysis tools, but also in identifying and formalizing the higherorder patterns of coordinated view composition that make these tools useful, usable, and generalizable across application domains.</p><p>ShowMe <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> (based on Tableau) is an exploratory visualization builder based on drag-and-drop editing of attribute hierarchies across scales. The combination of cross-filtering and attribute relationship graph is similar to multiscale visualization in ShowMe in how it is based on rapid interactive composition of complementary aspects of a central view, but differs in three ways. First, it provides a means to explore the details of many-to-many associations at the ground level of individual records, rather than the patterns of association that occur at higher levels of aggregation. Second, it allows the inclusion of dynamically derived attributes. Third, its data and visual abstraction operations can be parameterized in terms of additional external interactions, allowing design variations in support of special data types or analysis requirements.</p><p>Jigsaw <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> combines a variation of cross-filtering, in the form of value selection in cross-linked lists of entity types in documents, with a node-edge diagram specifically designed for exploring the many-to-many connections between those entities through the documents in which they appear. As a kind of attributed relational graph, the Jigsaw graph allows expansion and collapse of the entity nodes surrounding any given document node. Consequently, the graph provides an additional means of domain-specific drill-down interaction, in contrast with the general slicing interaction provided by node/edge/pack toggling in attribute relationship graphs.</p><p>Visualization schemas <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> models coordinated interaction between pairs of views in terms of one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships between data attributes. Any two views can coordinate, using a compound join, to display associations between data records in terms of their attributes. Cross-filtered views by itself can be thought of as a visualization schema involving independent, switchable, many-to-many filtering on selections between pairs of views. Attribute relationship graphs extend cross-filtering by making the one-to-one and one-to-many details of many-to-many relationships visually explicit within a centralized target that reflects drilled subsets of values only within a sliced subset of dimensions. The approach generalizes across application domains but allows substantial customization of data transformations, visual representations, and interactions in response to the particular data characteristics and analytic needs of those domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">ATTRIBUTE RELATIONSHIP GRAPHS</head><p>In this section, we consider attribute relationship graphs from three different perspectives: (1) as a method for interactively dissecting many-to-many relationships in multidimensional data, by building and modifying a graph that shows selected values (in selected dimensions) as nodes and selected classes of value co-occurrences as edges and hyperedges; (2) as a general pattern for constructing an interdependent set of data transformation operations that support the method; and (3) as an open-ended space of design variations for instantiating the pattern in particular visual analysis applications, including the encoding and filtering of data values and co-occurrences as graph elements. We describe each perspective with reference to examples of dissection in visualizations designed to support analysis in three different information domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Interaction As Dissection</head><p>Exploring data has often been compared with looking for needles in a stack of needles. When exploring heterogeneously typed multidimensional data, it is more like looking for hidden gems in a large box full of miscellaneous buttons, baubles, screws, rubberbands, and other objects of various shapes, sizes, and colors, untangling them from each other, and trying to understand how they came to be in the same box. Looking, untangling, and understanding all rely on the analyst's perception, knowledge, and experience to drive choices about which potential relationships between objects and their characteristics are worth considering over the course of exploration and analysis. The corresponding goal of attribute relationship graphs is to facilitate the identification and detailed characterization of many-to-many relationships in multidimensional information through visual interaction. As such, it extends the crossfiltered views method <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> by using visual interaction to ask even more detailed questions through dissection rather than mere observation of bulk correspondences between data item characteristics.</p><p>Visualizations built around an attribute relationship graph add a shell of queries, views, and interactions to an existing cross-filtered design. This additional structure is made up of two essential elements: a graph view, and a collection of switches for manipulat- ing its contents. The graph view displays a multigraph of attribute value co-occurrences by mapping each unique value into a node, each set of common co-occurrences into an edge, and the set of co-occurrence sets of any given value into a hyperedge. Nodes, edges, and hyperedges fall into equivalence classes according to the attributes, combination of attributes, and permutation of attributes that define them, respectively. Each switch toggles the visibility of a single equivalence class of graph element. Graph exploration is thus like dissection: examine data items for potential relationships by drilling into and slicing across dimensions to expose a specific cross-section. The example visualizations in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1,2</ref>,5 use variations of this structure to support exploration in different domains. Dissection as a mechanical process is nothing more than a sequence of freely interleaved brushing, switching, and graph layout interactions provoked by observation of visible values in the graph and the cross-filtering views. For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows dissection of the cross-section of NSF CAREER awards related to visualization, built as follows.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2c</ref>). Knowing that all PIs are in Graphics &amp; Visualization, (O) deselect it, thereby removing its node and associated links to make the graph less dense. What remains is a graph showing only the "non-visualization" programs for each award <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2d</ref>). It also reveals that (P) only three awards are solely in Graphics &amp; Visualization, and others are in special programs like (Q) EPSCoR.</p><p>At this point, the analyst could, for instance, find out which state the EPSCoR award is from by picking the award's PI and filtering States on PI to discover the answer, New Mexico. Alternately, the analyst could select all States (already CAREER-filtered), turn on State nodes and State-PI edges, then look at the many-to-many relationships to dissect nominal geographic relationships, also referring to the map to gain insight into spatial geographic relationships.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Queries</head><p>Attribute relationship graphs are built upon a general model of data abstraction, visual abstraction, and coordination for visualizing graphs. The model is a specialization of the data state model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> in which graph data structures and their visual representations are declared in terms of interactively driven tabular data transformations <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 3, right)</ref>. Under the model, designers specify the topology, visual encoding, filtering, layout, and brushing of graph views using well-known data abstraction, visual abstraction, and coordination mechanisms to specify content, appearance, and behavior. A series of transformation pipelines forms (ψ), encodes (π), filters (φ ), and handles brushing (σ ) for each graph element. Interdependencies between pipelines enforce topological constraints; all edges require two anchor nodes (possibly the same), and all packs require at least one member node. In the node pipeline (N), an additional transformation calculates the position of nodes as a function of current visual state using a combination of interactive (λ ) and automatic (Λ) layout. In the edge pipeline (E), the transformations on each edge have access to the data and visual abstractions of its anchor nodes. Similarly, the transformations on each pack in the pack pipeline (P) have access to the abstractions of its member nodes. This allows encoding of edges and packs in terms of node encodings, such as to draw edges as arrows that connect node shapes in a visually appealing way, regardless of changing positions of nodes during dynamic layout. This also allows encoding in terms of topology, such as to filter edges on in-degree or packs on member count.</p><p>Every transformation is a potential entry point for coordination; calculation of transformations (1 − 9), interactive brushing and layout (?), and automatic layout (∞) are all concurrent and update dynamically during coordinated interaction to or from the graph. It is often necessary to exploit only a few of the data transformation and interaction entry points in the model to design a graph tailored to a particular set of desirable exploration and analysis capabilities.</p><p>Collection of the three data sets for input into the three pipelines is not specified by the model, and can consist of any transformations that the visualization designer chooses to use for preprocessing. This flexibility of graph specification makes it relatively straightforward to adapt the results of cross-filtering for use as input into the graph <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 3, left)</ref>. In cross-filtered visualizations, data transformation consists of: grouping records into sets (G) for each unique attribute value; filtering each set, keeping records whose attribute values co-occur with those brushed in a subset of other views; visually encoding each value and its filtered set; and brushing values in each view. Because values are mapped one-to-one into nodes, the filtered groups (G ) of values that have been drilled down to in the cross-filtering views can be reused unchanged as input into the node pipeline. The node input data (T N input ) is a concatenation of the records in a subset of the filtered groups. The cross-filtering matrix determines which subsets of values; the node matrix determines which subset of groups (attributes).</p><p>Whereas nodes are first-class elements, independent of other elements, edges and packs are second-class elements defined in terms of a pair of anchor nodes (for edges) or a set of member nodes associated with a common reference node (for packs). Both can be calculated by mapping a pair of values into two anchor nodes (for edges) or a member and a reference node (for packs). Just as the group transformation calculates a table of {value, set} records for use in forming nodes, a clique transformation-essentially a grouping equijoin-calculates a table (C) of {value, value, set} records for use in forming edges and packs. Cliques are cross-filtered (C ) in the same way as groups. Because co-occurrence is symmetric, and hence edges are undirected, the edge input data (T E input ) is a concatenation of records from a combination of the filtered cliques; but because the co-occurrences for a given value can be both one-tomany and many-to-one, and hence packs are directed, the pack input data (T P input ) is a concatenation of records from a permutation of the filtered cliques. Edge and pack matrices determine which subsets of cliques, respectively. Overall, construction of an attribute relationship graph requires calculation of m groups and m 2 cliques for an m-dimensional data set. The results can be accumulated lazily as previously unvisited checkboxes are toggled on in the matrices.</p><p>An attribute relationship graph can thus be incorporated into an existing cross-filtered visualization with or without changes to existing views or their coordinations. Moreover, visualizations combined in this way inherit much of the design flexibility of both the general graph model and the cross-filtered views model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Design Variations</head><p>The query strategy used in the design of attribute relationship graphs has evolved through experience with several visualizations. The current data transformation pipeline is concrete and may be reused as a flexible template in new visualizations. Each visualization design involves customization of each transformation in order to accommodate particular data sets and analysis tasks. Customization includes picking one or more data sets to load, choosing which dimensions to include in dissection, then declaring m group and m 2 clique transformations for those dimensions. Visual encoding in the cross-filtering views is essentially unconstrained and may be specialized to suit the character and distribution of each data dimension. Encoding of graph elements is constrained by space and topology considerations, yet still affords a large space of practical variation. To elucidate attribute relationship graphs as a pattern for  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Visual Abstraction</head><p>Whereas each cross-filtered view can map values into graphical attributes using nearly any visual encoding technique that allows per-item brushing, the graph view is restricted to visual encodings that accommodate connectivity of nodes and edges, containment/connection of nodes in packs, and dynamics of node position in freeform or geometrically constrained layouts. Visual encoding of nodes can involve virtually any reasonably sized and reasonably convex shapes, but edges are best drawn as traditional lines or arrows, with packs as hulls or blobs (rather than, say, stars of thin lines that could be easily confused with edges). Perhaps surprisingly, brushing in the graph is not a requirement and is not a direct part of the dissection process. Nevertheless, an ability to highlight graph elements by selecting them may increase the effectiveness of examining large graphs during dissection <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Locking <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> is a high priority for addition to the general graph model. All graph elements can involve more than simple shape encoding to differentiate equivalence classes. For instance, nodes for movies, people, and awards in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> reflect differences in both attribute types and specific values using clearly distinguishable images. Edges can draw text describing connections (like in Have Green <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>), or show whether each node value is currently crossfiltered on the other using arrowheads on either or both ends. Moreover, it is possible to encode the grouping or cliquing data set of cooccurrences associated with a node's, edge's, or pack's value(s). Edge thickness and pack transparency are useful ways to depict co-occurrence counts, although large variation in these counts as a function of data distribution requires careful design. Encoding the co-occurrence data sets themselves turns nodes into small multiples of nested scatter plots, heatmaps, or histograms (although performance has been dismal when we have attempted to do so). Finally, a node can be triggered to perform an action as a function of its value or its grouping set, such as to link to the IMDB web page of an actor or to search the NSF web site for the awards of a PI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Data Abstraction</head><p>All of the attribute relationship graph visualizations that we have built so far have involved substantial customization of individual transformations at all points in the pipeline, but without changing the pipeline itself. Some of the more extensive structural variations involve addition of auxiliary views and sliders that: (1) preprocess and prefilter raw data sets at the beginning of the pipeline; (2) provide a detail view of all data records, optionally allowing dissection on a per-record basis by adding a unique record identifier (or other primary key) as a filtering dimension; or (3) provide alternate geographic or temporal representations for additional encoding or filtering of particular graph elements. The graph can also be filtered and/or encoded topologically. For example, the NSF visualization ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>) varies in five major ways. First, we split the one-table award database into nine dimensions across four relational data tables in a simple star schema with the award identifier as primary key. Second, we mitigated interactive performance limitations due to large data size by prefiltering out all but the CISE directorate. Third, we included the award identifier as a cross-filterable dimension. Fourth, we allow dynamic filtering of the graph on navigation in time series and map views. Finally, sliders filter edges and packs on minimum co-occurrence counts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3">Attribute Types</head><p>The data type of each dimension is a critical design factor. In general, graph views are unlike other views in that they depict bags of objects rather than true coordinate spaces ordered in one or more dimensions. Although many techniques exist for laying out graphs to account for such information, doing so would break the dimensional symmetry of graph appearance and behavior during dissection, especially in the face of variation from zero to one to two or more numerical dimensions. Data values are thus deliberately treated as effectively nominal or categorical at all points along the pipeline. Consequently, graph views depict numerical, temporal, and spatial values in an artificial way, stripped of the ordering and distribution information implied by their parent dimensionality.</p><p>Designing the cross-filtering views to depict values in their natural dimensional contexts may help to counterbalance this major limitation in using such a basic kind of graph view for dissection. For example, hours of the day in the wiki visualization ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>) appear both as nodes and as selectable bars in a time series histogram. Dates appear in a calendar as well. In a like manner, crossfiltering bestows attribute relationship graphs with qualified support for derived attributes, multiple attributes treated as one composite attribute, and multiple attributes across spatial and temporal scales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>Evaluating complex visual tools is an ongoing challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Despite its demonstrated utility for expressing a wide variety of tasks in different application domains-we have also built attribute relationship graph visualizations for CD collections, historic hotel registers, and shape classification experiments-the very flexibility of design that makes the technique so broadly useful also makes it an extraordinarily difficult target for evaluating usability. Evaluation of the cross-filtering technique on its own-see <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> for detailsrevealed two usability problems. First, a selection occlusion effect arises when selected items both cross-filter other views and are themselves cross-filtered out. We suspect that addition of the graph has a mixed impact on this effect, because (1) it shows all selected items in a dimension (or at least allows them to be seen by panning) <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>: Visualization of wiki edits from the VAST 2008 Wiki Editors Mini Challenge. The attribute relationship graph shows connections between prominent authors, frequent words, and revision types during early morning and afternoon activity at the end of two multi-day editing periods. Times (hours of the day) and dates are both treated as nominal data values; the corresponding nodes in the graph have been laid out by hand.</p><p>even when some of those items are invisible in their cross-filtered view, but (2) may create confusion due to this inconsistency. The alternative, filtering out these invisible items in the graph, would effectively reduce the graph to a simple drill-down view.</p><p>Second, an out of sight, out of mind effect occurs because users have trouble remembering more than the most recent states in the analysis process. We suspect that the graph alleviates this problem somewhat by shifting memory demands from tedious one-to-many interaction sequences in the cross-filtering views to simpler manyto-many examinations in the graph. While we believe that everyday formative evaluation of particular attribute relationship graph visualizations would help us to identify usability problems like these, our growing conviction is that characterizing them in complex designs requires systematic access to analytic provenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>access that, in analysts' hands, might address the problems directly.</p><p>The time to develop example visualizations has been about a week; the most recent visualization (NSF) took about ten hours. Reusable templates, added to Improvise for declaring cross-filtering and attribute relationship transformations, are one reason for this improvement in development time. Attribute relationship graphs are nevertheless generalizable, and can be adapted to other visualization toolkits and systems that are based on the data state model.</p><p>When calculating a clique query, each pair of uniquely occurring values can accumulate the data records in which they co-occur. The resulting small data set can be subjected to data transformations like any other, but its primary purpose is for calculating simple aggregates over the pair of values, such as to count the records for encoding as an edge width, or to sum amounts for encoding as a pack fill color. Accumulating and transforming many small data sets is expensive, and is not needed in any of the example visualizations. Consequently, clique queries currently calculate only counts rather than accumulate co-occurrence data subsets for each pair of values. On current desktop hardware, typical interactive response is below 100 milliseconds in Cinegraph and the wiki edit visualization, but often exceeds ten seconds in the NSF visualization.</p><p>For m dimensions and n data records, the full set of m 2 clique queries has time complexity of O(m 2 n 2 ). By lazily calculating each clique, when the user first toggles on either the edge or one of the packs for some pair of dimensions, clique calculation becomes a sequence of amortized O(n 2 ) operations interspersed throughout the analysis process. This strategy is effective for dissection because it is common for only a fraction of all possible dimensional pairs to be visited during any given analysis session-even when all dimensions are involved individually-but can cause impatience while waiting for new cliques to be calculated. Moreover, variability in the number of unique values of each attribute is common, creating imbalances in the cardinalities of graph element equivalence classes, causing unevenness in group and clique calculation speed, and posing a design challenge in mapping value distributions into appropriate views for cross-filtering. Response time in the NSF visualization is slow-especially when aggregating award totalsbecause the large and skewed interactive working set thrashes the in-memory data transformation caches implemented in Improvise.</p><p>Cross-filtered views supports analysis by selecting values of each attribute separately, meaning that dissection under cross-filtering is unary. Attribute relationship graphs allow binary dissection by making it possible to examine values of attributes pairwise. While analytic utility is substantially increased, it remains dimensionally limited. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, edge thickness reflects all awards to a PI under each program, not just CAREER awards. Although each clique's data set could be filtered on the selected values of other attributes, the edge encoding would still only reflect a count; the multigraph information in each edge is not encoded at all, let alone to reflect filtering beyond that of its two node anchor attributes. Attribute relationship graphs thus support visual dissection of relationships at one, but only one, order higher than cross-filtered views. One wonders what visual techniques might support dissection of trinary and higher-order relationships in multidimensional data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>Attribute relationship graphs are a method and visualization design pattern for exposing and dissecting many-to-many relationships buried in heterogeneously typed multidimensional data sets. Several example visualizations demonstrate the generality and flex-ibility of attribute relationship graphs, and provide insights into specialization for different data sources and analysis needs. Through significant extension of the cross-filtering method and pattern, we have made further progress in identifying, characterizing, instantiating, and reusing effective multiple view compositions at a high level of design abstraction. Our ongoing goal is to provide analysts with increasingly flexible and precise yet usable means to explore and analyze deep details and subtle patterns in complex data spaces. More broadly, we aim to help build a methodological foundation for the development of classes and instances of synthetic pathways that are demonstrably useful for designing visual-interactive compounds for effective exploration and analysis of data in both general and specialized knowledge domains.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The Cinegraph visualization of recent movies in the Internet Movie Database.</figDesc></figure>

The attribute relationship graph progressively shows: (a) all principal investigators (PIs) in visualization-related programs, (b) only the CAREER PIs, (c) all other programs under which their CAREER awards fall, and finally (d) only these other programs.

Turn on (D) Program and PI nodes, (E) Program-PI edges, and (F) PI-Program packs. (G) Apply manual and automatic layout as desired. (The generic force-directed algorithm alone does a reasonable job, but manual tweaking helps.) Figure 2a shows the graph at this point. Next, (H) filter award IDs on programs. In the Awards view, (I) sort by title, then (J) range select all titles that start with "CA-REER". (K) Filtering on award IDs shows how CAREER awards distribute over NSF organizations, managers, programs, states, institutions, and PIs; CoPIs can be ignored because CAREER awards don't have any. (L) Again select all PIs. The graph now shows only PIs who have visualization-related CAREER awards (Figure 2b). Now, (M) filter programs on PIs. Only the Graphics &amp; Visualization program remains of the three, meaning that every award is in this program. (N) Again select all programs, then relayout the graph</figDesc></figure>
