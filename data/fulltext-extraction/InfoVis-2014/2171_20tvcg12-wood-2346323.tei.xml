<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>As the discipline of information visualization matures, we can recognise several attempts to reflect on successes and failures in order to abstract and generalize good practice and guidance. Such reflections have ranged in focus from visualization system design <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> to interaction design <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, from visualization task taxonomies <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>  alization objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> and from abstractions of visualization architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> to abstractions of the process of reporting design studies themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. For good reason, most academic accounts focus on development of visualization design, construction and evaluation and tend to characterize the process as a sequential one. While this approach provides a useful means to offer generalizable guidance, the focus on sequential, often linear, development of visualization processes does perhaps provide only a partial view of what visualization has to offer. To extend the reach of a design study, we identify the idea of a visualization channel -the evolving and often complex relationship between the producers and consumers of visualization. In this paper we argue that a parallel multi-channel approach to visualization offers a richer way of engaging with data, topics and organisations and that this may have a positive influence on visualization design that results in more persuasive or impactful means of effecting change. Through</p><p>For information on obtaining reprints of this article, please send e-mail to: tvcg@computer.org. an extended case study reflecting a four-year engagement with a particular data-rich application area, we argue that considering broader issues of visualization design and use such as metaphor, trust, authority, storytelling, insight and engagement and the interactions between them, we can extend the notion of what constitutes a 'design study' and how we might best approach visualization design.</p><p>The main contributions of this work are twofold. Firstly, we offer a detailed conventional sequential 'design study' demonstrating how appropriate visualization design can lead to deep insight and impact in a policy making context (Section 2 and Section 4.2). Secondly we offer evidence that extending visualization design to use rich multichannel engagement leads, though processes of intentional design as well as engineered serendipity, to more impactful and effective discourse between producers and consumers of visualization (Section 4 and Section 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">DATA CONTEXT AND THE PROBLEM DOMAIN</head><p>Our focus is on a large dataset that contains personal information about individuals and their spatio-temporal travel behaviors. Very large and rapid increases in the availability, scope and precision of such data has brought many new opportunities for researchers working within the social and behavioral sciences <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. In transport studies, a community with which we wished to engage, the advent of smartcard technologies is the most obvious example. Although introduced as an efficient fare payment method, the data generated by smartcard systems offer a very complete historical record of demand on a public transport network <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. However, linking anonymized customer travel records, these data can be used to characterize and understand various aspects of individual travel behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. The emergence of recent, information-technology based public bikeshare schemes is another example. In a similar way that smartcards record 'tap ins' and 'tap outs' on major metro systems, third-generation bikeshare schemes contain technologies that allow a bicycle's movement to be tracked and, as with smartcard data, this transactional information can be linked to individual customers.</p><p>We explore the roles visualization can play in engaging with the research and policy communities and the general public by considering a public bikeshare scheme that was introduced in London, UK in July 2010. The initiative, here referred to as the London Cycle Hire Scheme (LCHS), was modeled on the successful Vélib scheme introduced in Paris in 2007 and constitutes a major public transport project in central London. At the time of its launch, the LCHS comprised around 5,000 hire bicycles and a network of 315 self-service docking stations each with a capacity to store between 10-40 bicycles. It has since grown to over 700 docking stations and around 11,000 bicycles available for use at any given time. Two major organisations are involved in managing and operating the scheme. Transport for London (TfL) is the local government body with strategic and management responsibility for public transport in London, including the LCHS. TfL have responsibility for the medium and long term running of the scheme, including its expansion, pricing and wider strategic perspective on encouraging cycling in the capital. The logistics company Serco Group have responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the scheme including managing the communications infrastructure between the docking stations and the distribution and maintenance of the bicycles.</p><p>A key characteristic of the scheme that offers opportunities for analysis and visual exploration is the detailed digital record of its use. Three datasets in particular have been central to the visualization and analysis opportunities offered by the scheme. Firstly, a realtime record of every docking station's status, including the number of bicycles currently docked and number of free spaces available, is generated continually at 3-minute intervals, resulting in c.300m records generated between the start of the scheme and March 2014. Secondly, every journey made between an origin and destination docking station is recorded and timestamped along with the id of the user making the journey and the bicycle on which it was made. While the precise trajectory between each origin and destination is not known (although it can be modeled <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>), the accumulation of approximately 25m journeys by January 2014 provides a potentially valuable spatio-temporal picture of journey patterns. Thirdly, approximately 70% of journeys are made by 'members' who have registered in advance to use the scheme and so provide details about their home location and gender (via title and name). The structure of the data sources providing detail of where and when journeys are made and who makes them is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Tables 1-3</ref>.  These member records not only give population-level information about who is using the scheme, but can be linked to journey details to provide a very large, complete spatio-temporal profile of individual cyclists' journeys. The detail and volume of these data is in contrast to most data sources used in studies of cyclists' behavior, especially in studies that examine the factors that motivate and discourage cycling within cities <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Much of this prior work has involved commissioning social surveys that ask respondents to recall their experiences and attitudes towards cycling <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, but is vulnerable to self-selection and social-desirability bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p><p>While the LCHS data were not collected and distributed for any single purpose, there are a number of general challenges around the operation and management of the scheme for which they may be suitable. These vary in their task clarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> but help to set the context of use and potential for visualization of these data to have impact:</p><p>• Day to day operation of the scheme should run smoothly ensuring there are sufficient bicycles distributed around the network and sufficient spaces to dock them.</p><p>• Intervention in the scheme, such as the redistribution of bicycles to keep the system balanced, should be as efficient as possible.</p><p>• What does use of the scheme tell transport planners and researchers about the influences on cyclists' behavior in London and more widely?</p><p>• How can patterns of use of the scheme be used to assist in planning for its expansion that meets demand and encourages 'modal shift' towards cycling?</p><p>In the subsequent sections we consider how visualizing the data through a number of different channels has helped in addressing these and other challenges. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RETHINKING VISUALIZATION DESIGN MODELS</head><p>We can identify approaches to sequential and parallel modeling of visualization design at two distinct scales. Most commonly, modeling has focussed on the transformation of data to visual encoding and its mapping to cognition and task. This is most widely seen in the foundational, and much refined, visualization reference model or "InfoVis pipeline" <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, through which data are mapped to visual form to support interactive sense making. The application of the pipeline model tends to emphasize the visualization design process as something that occupies a single, sequential channel of activity -even when this process is cyclical <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, or involves loops <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. There are some attempts to consider non-sequential refinements to the pipeline model, such as that of Jansen and Dragicevic <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, who account for visualization beyond the desktop to include branching and merging. Parallel development at this scale is more commonly discussed at the ideation phase of visualization design <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> where the cost of prototyping multiple designs is comparatively small. Some work reports on successful use of parallel prototyping <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> to inform visualization design <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, however multiple designs tend to be merged or filtered ultimately to inform a single 'product' or analytical objective. In contrast, there is relatively little work that models design at the scale of parallel projects with their own distinct objectives and audiences. A rare example is that of Sedlmair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, who considered a three-year study centered around a visual analytics system for the automotive industry. Here, several related component products were developed in parallel but lessons from one stream of activity were used to inform others. In this paper, however, we extend this notion of parallel development to include a much more diverse set of tasks, contexts and audiences while linking them all to the same underlying data and problem domain.</p><p>Prior work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>) tends to characterize visualization design along a number of related continua -private (personal) vs public visualization; exploratory vs analytical visualization; vaguely expressed vs precisely formed research hypotheses.</p><p>Although their useful examples describe single systems, we do not find parallel efforts used to describe the wider processes of discourse in the visualization literature despite a number of examples of long term relationships between visualization producers and consumers.</p><p>The literature on visualization design that does describe discourse frequently distinguishes 'visualization experts' from 'domain experts' (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>) and characterizes visualization design as a series of interactions between the two. This dichotomy is understandable given that the impetus behind academic publishing in visualization is for largely computer science based academics to demonstrate their visualization expertise. Design and domain expertise are both undoubtedly required in order to generate true insight as without both there is a danger of simplistic or ineffective visualization (e.g., some of the early work characterising computational social science <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>), or visualization that is not used by those with domain expertise. However, as techniques mature and tools to implement those techniques become more readily accessible, that distinction is likely to become increasingly blurred. Assigning an exclusive role of 'visualization expert' or 'domain expert' to an individual may fail to capture the more complex multiplicity of roles taken by those engaging with visualization that may change over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> or with context.</p><p>Understanding the discourse between producers and consumers of visualization is informed by debate in the social research community concerning the ambitions of computational social science and the way in which research is organised. Many early contributions within the computational social sciences have been criticised for simply confirming already existing social theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and few have been published in traditional social science journals or attempted to engage deeply with social science literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. One explanation is that to date, datadriven social sciences studies have largely been defined by, and conducted within, computer science departments <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Too often there is an emphasis on either using existing methods, or developing new generalizable computational techniques, without adequate consideration of the degree to which such solutions deliver meaningful or important findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. The tensions between computing and domain-specific ambitions have been discussed at length within information visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and appear prescient given these current critiques of computational social science <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>We deliberately characterize the roles of the computing specialist and domain expert less clearly than is typical in this literature through our focus on channels rather than roles. We have expertise and interest both in information visualization and transport studies research. The 'domain specialists' in this study (those responsible for the bikeshare scheme's design, operation and wider strategy) also have evolving and variable expertise in visualization as well as transport theory.</p><p>Our experience suggests that models of the visualization process that move away from the visualization expert / domain expert roles, and are wider than the typical sequential pipelines, may help us capture and describe the rich design experience and evolving relationships through which high levels of engagement are achieved. We also consider it likely that engaging in visualization broadly, through multiple interaction based upon a particular topic or theme, may result in more meaningful, informed and persuasive visualization. The result is a rich body of inter-related work upon which a broad engagement can draw. We therefore choose to characterize the contexts where visualization plays a role in discourse as channels, without necessarily imposing fixed roles on the individuals involved in that discourse, in an effort to explore these relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">VISUALIZATION DISCOURSE CHANNELS</head><p>By identifying channels of discourse, we recognise that several may exist in parallel and that they have a capacity to interact with one another, while each can be associated with different visualization design approaches. Channels may be characterized by the context of engagement rather than a fixed set of participants or precisely defined tasks. In the context of our four-year engagement with the LCHS data, we have recognised seven distinct but connected channels where visualization of the data has been central to the discourse between those involved (summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Discourse with operational managers</head><p>One of the challenges in operating the LCHS is to ensure that the system as a whole is balanced -that is, that there are sufficient bicycles spread around all docking stations for people to collect and that there are sufficient spaces at those stations for people to dock bicycles at the end of their journeys. This challenge is a specific example of the 'fleet management problem' <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> where an optimised relocation of vehicles is required to maintain a balanced system while minimizing the interventions required to ensure that balance. This is particularly challenging in the context of the LCHS because of a strong commuter-driven tidal flow of bicycles between the periphery and the core during peakhour periods in the morning and evening. We define the role of visualization in the support of this task as being part of an operational channel, characterized by the need for real-time monitoring and response to ensure continuous smooth running of the bicycle hire system.</p><p>In many ways, the task of designing and using visualization to support this operational channel is one for which visual analytics solutions should be well suited. It is, in terms of the task-information space <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, a crisply-defined task for which there is plenty of computer-based data to support it. Similar well defined analytical tasks have led to new visual analytic designs, such as trajectory lenses <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> that provide analytic precision at the cost of having to learning new visual analytic processes. We have previously documented how we designed a spatial gridded dashboard to support realtime monitoring of the scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> that allows parallel visual processing of many hundreds of docking stations in order to identify potential problem areas (local clusters of full or empty docking stations). An example of part of the dashboard is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> where patterns of docking station use of the previous 24 hours, updated in realtime, can be used by operators to spot problems. Further insight into the causes of the problems can be gained using an OD map representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref> that avoids the salience bias of longer journeys that would arise with a more conventional flow map of the system. Yet, despite the visual design of such a system being tailored to the task at hand, after initial enthusiasm by the operators of the scheme, the system was never used on a day-to-day basis. In examining the reasons for this 'failure', we can identify a number of the pitfalls enumerated by Sedlmair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. At the 'winnowing' and 'discovery' stages it could be argued that PF-9 -'no need for change: existing tools are good enough' was key here and to some extent so too was PF-15 -'ignoring practices that currently work well'. At the early stages of the scheme, in practice the operators could rely on personal knowledge of London transport behavior (PF4 -'no real data available') and spreadsheet views of the realtime data to do the job adequately. As a result, at the implementation stage the effort required by operators to learn a new visual grammar and operate an unfamiliar system (PF23 -'usability: too little / too much') was seen to cost more than the benefits it might confer. This remains a challenge for implementing any new system for day-to-day operational matters in that there is not the luxury of being able to pause operation while a new system is learned and evaluated. We also note that the activity surrounding our initial involvement in this channel of discourse with the operators was carried out without the context of other channels to provide evidence to build trust, capability and efficacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Discourse with Policy Makers and Transport Studies</head><p>The experience of working via the operational channel in part fed into developing academic work in the transport studies domain. It also demonstrated to us that there may be a role for visualization in supporting a more strategic level of engagement with the LCHS, and in particular in supporting the needs of the local government transport authority, TfL, in their various goals to understand and encourage cycling in the capital. In this context, the primary goal of using visualization was to facilitate deep insight, both with the TfL policy makers and transport studies community. Longer term strategic and epistemological engagement also provided the opportunity to use visualization of the LCHS in a number of parallel channels with cross-over between them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Exploratory analysis</head><p>To open a discourse with those in transport studies researching urban bicycle behavior and its influences (Section 2), it was important to explore how individual cyclists might use the LCHS, and the extent to which cycling within a bikeshare scheme might relate to other forms of cycling. For example, as is the case in other studies of urban cyclists' behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, do returning bikeshare customers cycle for utilitarian or other purposes, and are particular types of customer predisposed to either behavior? These research ambitions were shared by policy makers at TfL, who wished to explore informal hypotheses about their customers and understand how certain target groups use the scheme.</p><p>We first created a set of demographic and behavioral variables to discriminate different types of behavior and used TfL's informal knowledge of the scheme and current literature in transport studies to guide this process. Using the home postal code recorded for each member, we added two geodemographic classifiers and a 'distance-tonearest-docking-station' variable to each customer record. Recency-Frequency (RF) segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, a technique that segments customers according to how often and recently they buy or use a product or service, was then used to separate more active scheme users from those using the LCHS only occasionally. Borrowing from approaches that use similar timed origin-destination travel datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>, we clustered members info five groups according to when they typically travel: 9-to-5ers (26% of customers), postwork-ers (13%), anytime users (27%), weekenders (15%) and lunchtime users (19%). Naming these clusters in an identifiable way that resonated with those studying them (in contrast, for example, to naming them C1, C2 etc.) was seen as an important part of the engagement process with policy makers as it provided them with a language with which to communicate findings with others in the organisation. This enriched set of customer-related variables provided the basis for deeper discourse with the transport studies and transport planning communities.</p><p>In order to collaboratively explore this attribute information, particularly with transport planning colleagues at TfL, we designed and built a flexible visual analysis application <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 4)</ref> for quickly relating customer variables to their spatio-temporal structure via three coordinated and linked views <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Exploring gender and cycling behavior</head><p>Exploratory data analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> within this application took place alongside policy makers and operations staff at TfL; we acted as an interface to the tool and guided TfL staff through the various interactions by chauffeuring. Early customer satisfaction surveys from the LCHS reveal that women are underrepresented amongst scheme members, consistent with more general findings of gender and cycling behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Discussing this with transport policy makers at TfL, we agreed the first substantial theme for analysis should address men's and women's use of the scheme. The findings from this analysis have already been detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, but we provide a summary here in order to demonstrate the depth of analysis insight achieved through this channel of activity.</p><p>Selecting all male and then female customers in the application revealed a dominant commuter function for male cyclists and dominant leisure function for female cyclists. This is apparent in the customer-related and temporal views: women are very underrepresented amongst the most active users and the 9-to-5er, postwork-er and lunchtime cluster groups. While there is further evidence of this in the temporal view, the differences are perhaps best characterized when studying the spatial view ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>). For men, there is a familiar pattern of journeys between London's major rail hubs and CBD, whereas a very different pattern is true of women: bicycle trips taken within London's parks are most obvious, with comparatively few taken in central London.</p><p>Colleagues at TfL were already familiar with these high-level gendered patterns as they had been articulated in a separate channel of activity (Section 4.3). We found the confirmatory nature of these initial insights provided a way of introducing the richer attribute information and visual discourse discussed in Section 4.2.1. Upon the trust offered by the visual confirmatory analysis we started to uncover patterns unanticipated by the transport planners. Highly visible amongst the most active bicycle users were those living outside London who, after commuting into the city on a train, regularly used the scheme to travel between the major rail hubs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>). Importantly, women were very underrepresented amongst this customer population living outside London. In simply selecting either male or female customers, we therefore compare two very different populations. This finding was important to both the transport studies and transport planning communities, as it suggested that the large differences in gendered cycling behavior may be particular to the LCHS rather than representative of wider experiences and attitudes to cycling held by men and women.</p><p>Filtering the visualization by selecting only those members who live within 5km of a docking station showed some convergence between male and female customers, particularly in their temporal travel behaviors. However, we found that women were still underrepresented amongst the more active, commuting scheme users. Further discussing this with TfL, we finally compared male and female customers but controlled both by how far members live from a docking station and how heavily they use the scheme. While this brings even greater convergence on some variables, important differences in spatial travel behaviors remain. Importantly, for this group of active and experienced female scheme users, travel behaviors were spatially constrained: journeys within west London and parks dominate, and elsewhere journeys are taken in very particular parts of the city. The visualization application became a central part of this process of sense making, building on both the trust built by initial confirmatory analysis, but also the trust and credibility developed in discourse within the public, transport studies and academic visualization channels (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>). It constituted a highly appropriate, and perhaps in fact the only credible, means of finding these particular parts of the city and relating them to each other, existing knowledge (or its absence) and explanations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Labelling, confirming and explaining behaviors</head><p>In a second phase of analysis driven by TfL operations managers, we identified with much greater certainty all commuting journeys, and by extension all individuals we suspected were commuters. Our commuter modeling has already been documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, so we reflect here on the role of visualization in fostering collaboration with colleagues at TfL, as well as the deeper findings elicited by this analysis. By maintaining design consistency with earlier visualizations used with TfL we were able to better communicate our analysis visually and explore modeling assumptions with them. In describing our analytical decisions with reference to real data, TfL were able to offer plausible suggestions for more obscure spatial patterns of workplaces based on their operational knowledge of the scheme. Two important discoveries resulted from this second phase of chauffeured interaction. Firstly, that imbalances in numbers of morning and evening commutes to workplaces towards the periphery of London suggest a previously unforeseen operational challenge around managing the bikeshare fleet. Secondly, that there are differences in the geography of men's and women's daily workplace commutes which, when analysed alongside data on London's labour market, appear to partially reflect differences in the actual geography of their respective workplaces. The observed differences in spatial travel behaviors described in Section 4.2.2 might not, then, relate to differing motivations and barriers to cycling as suggested in the transport studies literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, but to differences in the geography of employment opportunities for men and women. Given this alternative explanation, in a further analytical step we studied spatial travel behaviors in more detail. A limitation of using the bikeshare dataset to study spatial behavior is that with only the origin and destination of cycle journeys, nothing is known about the nature and context of likely cycled routes. We therefore derived routing information for every cycled OD pair in the dataset by linking to a cycle road network routing engine. For each route, heuristics on the nature of cycle journeys were collected including number of signalled junctions, difficult right turns, elevation data, and traffic flow volumes. Given the uncertainty of predicted road choice behaviour, we focussed our analysis on the bridge crossings necessary to connect origin and destination locations. Visual exploration of spatial and gendered journey patterns involving river crossings showed differences in male and female cyclists' use of bridges, which appear to be strongly related to the geography of their workplaces. This suggested that spatial differences in travel behaviors between men and women are not a function of differing attitudes to cycling, as suggested in transport literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Women may be underrepresented amongst commuting journeys that involve a river crossing because those very journeys involve routes that are busier and more demanding than river crossing journeys cycled by men. This in turn led to further analysis, not described here, where we considered group cycling behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> as a strategy for dealing with the demands of urban cycling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.4">Role of visualization</head><p>The analytical path outlined above captures a very deliberate and collaborative approach to data analysis. The themes we pursued were informed by TfL's priorities and those within transport studies and our findings were validated against TfL's knowledge and the literature of the domain. In design study terms, our early engagement with relevant literature and the LCHS's operational priorities might reflect a successful strategy of 'winnowing' -of selecting collaborators, finding an appropriate dataset and establishing substantive research needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. The description of data processing and exploratory visual analysis, through to more involved visual analytic activity and detailed explanatory analysis, maps closely onto the iterative process of problem characterisation and abstraction and of design and implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. As an example of problem-driven research, our approach was validated by the depth of insights achieved: the fact that work has been published in high profile academic journals within the transport studies domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref>] and that we addressed operational priorities to the satisfaction of the transport authority. Our analysis started with a meaningful, but relatively open set of research questions -how are individual cycle behaviors structured and how do they relate to more general cycle behaviors? By creating a set of discriminating derived variables, and designing tools to visualize and analyse those variables, we developed more focussed analysis requirements and data-driven hypotheses. Our decreasing dependence on exploratory analysis techniques in later work reflects a progression towards 'a final goal of a fully automatic [data analysis] solution' <ref type="bibr">[43, pp. 2433</ref>].</p><p>While we subscribe to many of the strategies for effective problemdriven research set out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, other apparently separate visualization activities and events played an important role in the analysis and in sidestepping many of the pitfalls common to design studies. These activities and events are not captured by the more narrow discussion of problem-area, datasets and analysis tasks. For example, the previous work described in Section 4.1 enabled us to build trust and establish some authority when approaching collaborators. The specific events discussed in Section 4.3 and Section 4.4 helped generate excitement and a deeper engagement in the more involved analysis activities. We argue that these parallel influences from other channels of discourse helped protect against PF-5, 'insufficient time available from potential collaborators', and contributed to 'rapport with collaborators' (PF-11).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Discourse with the public</head><p>Bicycle travel within an urban setting has a resonance with the wider public beyond those involved in the transport policy context. Equally, the potential for novel ways of using new data sources, especially through visual means has the potential to engage the wider community beyond those involved in transport management, policy and academic activity. We wished to capitalise on both of these opportunities by producing a more accessible and engaging depiction of the data and the findings derived from them.</p><p>Unlike the policy and transport studies channel, here the goal wasn't deep insight but rather engagement with the themes of both urban bicycle travel and big data / data visualization. This required more familiar graphical encodings of movement as well as the need to generate insight rapidly before a non-committed audience lost interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Central to the visualization design in this channel was the idea of metaphor supporting that rapid engagement process. This led to the creation of an animated view <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> of the first 5 million journeys incorporating a number of supporting metaphors. The most obvious of which was to encode movement of bicycles with animated movement in a geospatial layout. In order to compress a year's worth of journeys into an accessible two-minute animation, symbols representing an individual journey were generated stochastically but in proportion to the relative frequency of actual journeys made between docking stations. This created an apparent time-compressed bird's eye view of flows of cyclists around London.</p><p>To convey the value of big data and visualization as means to generate insight, the symbolisation of each journey was varied over the course of the two minute animation whereby the initial view showed all journeys as moving dots, but over time, only the more common journeys were represented as the less frequent journeys were gradually filtered out and those that were more frequent became symbolised as gradually elongated 'trails' along the most common paths. This was supported by color encoding of journeys as points of light against a dark background with no mapping contextualisation. The effect was to convey a sense of structure emerging out of the chaos of the initial view; a powerful metaphor in persuading a general audience that there was some value in visualizing new data sources such as these. What we did not anticipate was that this metaphor resonated strongly with TfL policy makers too, and it became a useful means by which to induct other members of the policy team who had not previously been aware of our visual analytics work. The emerging structure had clear geographic causes, making it easy to associate the patterns observed with the major influences of commuter-dominated travel from mainline railway stations and leisure-dominated travel around the major parks of the city.</p><p>The accessibility of this form of representation, in contrast to visual analytic design in the operator and policy channels resulted in this work attracting the attention of the popular press in the UK, including the New Scientist (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6)</ref>, The Economist and a number of national newspapers. The hypnotic effect of the slowly emerging structure was enhanced by the New Scientist with the addition of an ambient musical soundtrack. This embellishment added little in terms of analytic insight, but it may have increased memorability of the information being conveyed <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. It also suggests that visualization in the public realm is subject to influences and modification beyond the control of the visualization designer in a more familiar research or professional setting. While the design decisions taken to enhance accessibility and engagement may attract wider audiences, there is a tension with the design decisions required to facilitate analysis and deeper insight. Adopting separate channels for these two levels of engagement may be one approach to handling this tension, but there is the danger that accessible design can compromise perceptions of academic capability. This is indicated by one of the comments posted by a viewer of the New Scientist animation: "That is indeed very pretty, but it rather prioritises 'visual' over 'analytics'. I hope they also did some less expensive but more informative analysis."</p><p>One approach to effect greater influence within the discourse with the general public is to adopt a more explicit storytelling approach to visual communication. This was used directly when reporting the visualization work with the LCHS via a TEDx talk <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Here, through strong author-driven narrative <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, the unexpected 'discovery' of structure out of chaos and ultimately an explanation for that structure was made explicit. This contrast between the initially unintelligible chaos of the visualization with the structure that emerges follows the 'contour of communication' that seeks to juxtapose the 'what is' with the 'what could be' <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. This was reinforced further with additional storytelling devices such as placing the audience in the picture (the location of the talk was within the mapped area of the visualization) and relating the personal to the bigger picture.</p><p>One of the unexpected consequences of having a compact and accessible data visualization story in the form of a 15 minute recorded TEDx talk was that without prompting, policy makers and operators in TfL started to share the recording as a means of explaining how the data from the LCHS could be exploited through visualization. We suspect that this was helped by the power of the metaphor 'structure out of chaos', as this was precisely the task facing many of those within the organisation sitting on an unexploited source of 'big data'. Like earlier analytic work with TfL, it acted both in a confirmatory capacity, showing features of cycle usage the policy makers were aware of (e.g., large tidal commuting flows), and revealing new insights they were not (e.g., gender-specific behavior). The fact that some members of the policy team were introducing others to data visualization through the TEDx 'artefact' suggests a more complex and nuanced set of roles as both consumers and producers of visualization as part of discourse. Visualization systems designed primarily for analytics (such as the one described in Section 4.2) would not have served this purpose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Discourse via the Museum Sector</head><p>The unforeseen consequences of designing for parallel visualization channels did not only benefit policy makers. By building trust and authority through discourse with the transport studies community and policy makers we were recommended by TfL to the Museum of London to contribute to a three month exhibition 'London Cycles' (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) aimed at putting contemporary cycling patterns into a historical context of cycling in London, using bicycles from the museum's collection alongside new digital acquisitions.</p><p>TfL donated a single LCHS bicycle to the museum along with a digital record of its travel history in spreadsheet form. The museum's task was to provide an exhibit that somehow related the physical and digital artefacts in their collection, contextualizing both. By adapting the animation approach discussed in Section 4.3 to include not just general patterns of movement, but additionally highlighting the movement history of the bicycle in the museum's collection, that link could be established through data visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. The use of a more conventional animation-focussed design rather then the more analytically oriented visualization used with TfL and the transport operators follows the recommendation by Hinrichs et al. to 'reward short term exploration' in museum exhibits while the detail and depth of the data being depicted supported longer term exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. This formed the centerpiece of an exhibit where visitors were encouraged to find the single highlighted bicycle trajectory among those left by the other 20 million journeys being represented. To support the connection between the digital and the physical this was accompanied by a set of prints depicting the 'urban signatures' left by the single bicycle as it was cycled around the city over its lifetime. The design of these printed data visualizations employed the metaphor of the hand-drawn 'signature' by using fluid Bézier curves to link docking stations that formed the bicycle's travel history (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref>). This was further enhanced by relating the line thickness in part to the local curvature of the trajectory as well as a small degree of spatially autocorrelated random noise and superimposing the signatures on a simulated hand drawn map of London <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. These visual design decisions were not driven by conventional good practice in data visualization (e.g., as documented by Block et al. for their DeepTree museum exhibit <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>), but rather by reinforcing the metaphor of the human-driven expression of the personal and unique.</p><p>Adapting the visualization design to suit discourse with this channel of communication offered the opportunity to provoke discussion on the nature of the digital and visual in recording and explaining our behaviors. This led to the Museum not only archiving the visualization artefacts themselves, but also the code used to construct them. The Digital Curator at the Museum of London commented "The code, data visualisations and animation reflect the contemporary nature of using open data to make sense of patterns in a useful way for future planning in London. This collection of digital files also reminds us that in contemporary London people are leaving digital traces of their activity behind as they go about their everyday lives".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Discourse Through Art</head><p>The use of data-driven visualization as a form of artistic expression has led academics to consider what distinguishes analytic-driven and artistically-driven visualization (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>). Until recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> much of that discussion has focussed on aesthetics in design or even just the presence or absence of pre-defined functional purpose <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. What appears to be neglected in this discussion of information visualization is the role context plays in framing visual thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>The creation of an art installation 'We are the City' as part of the Digital Shoreditch festival in London provided an opportunity to consider this notion of context framing. An adapted version of the bicycle movement animation was developed that allowed two parameters of the visual encoding -the weighting given to more frequent journeys in comparison to less frequent ones, and the length of the trails left by each journey -to be controlled by body movement via a hidden XBox Kinect device. The frequency weighting parameter was controlled by the number of people detected in the vicinity of the installation and the position of the arms of a viewer was used to control the length of the animated trails. The goal of the interaction was to build on the idea that patterns of bicycle movements were a reflection of how people had chosen to move around the city. Additionally, the color of the trails was controlled by a live feed to data on where bicycles were currently located around the city. By combining depiction of an individual's personal body movement with the passage of a single bicycle shared by many people with the aggregate behavior of many millions of journeys, the intention was to provoke thoughts on the relationship between the individual, shared space, 'big data' and visualization.</p><p>The setting of the installation, located in the basement of a large town hall along with 20 other exhibits, was also important in its impact. The environment was dark (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref>) and the rooms in which each of the installations were located were connected by a deliberately disorienting maze of passageways. Teaser postcards showing sample bicycle signatures (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7)</ref> were provided to all visitors to the exhibition. Thus encountering the installation was itself one of 'discovery'. To support this, only oblique instructions were provided suggesting that body movement might influence what was being shown, so that the act of revealing structure in movement from the chaos became part of the act of discovery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">The task-information space</head><p>The channels of discourse in which visualization plays a role can be mapped onto the task-information space proposed by Sedlmair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. This consists of two orthogonal axes that describe task clarity, ranging on a continuum from 'fuzzy' to 'crisp' and information location, again on a continuum ranging from 'in the domain expert's head' to 'in the computer'. Sedlmair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> use this space to usefully define a design study contribution as "moving forward along either of these axes". Mapping our channels of discourse to this space reveals a number of contributions that may accordingly be deemed to be 'design study' in nature but do not necessarily involve moving 'forward' along the axes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Figure 9</ref>). We observe that some of the channels occupy quite significant portions of this space (e.g., public engagement) while others are more crisply located (e.g., transport operations). As discourse evolves over time, there may be movement within this space although not necessarily towards the crisp task definition / computer-based data portion of the space. The Transport Policy discourse channel, as one of the key objectives of our work, has involved establishing knowledge, refining questions and developing tools in at least three stages. The processes and choices involved in the exploration described in Section 4.2 (transport policy and studies channels) bear many of the hallmarks of an information visualization design study and as such show trajectories that move towards more computable solutions. However, we also contend that some of the discourse channels deliberately follow different trajectories. For example, engagement via artistic channels involves a more fluid two-way movement between digitally captured data and personal subjective knowledge and emotion. They use artefacts as disruptive interventions designed to present alternative perspectives on a problem and to encourage those who engage with them in re-thinking rather than to clarify tasks. The discourse with the museum sector evolved from artistic expression of subjective experience towards a digitally captured representation, not perhaps in the way foreseen by the design studies methodology, but rather through the process of the museum archiving the source code behind the visualization. Reporting of the work via the academic visualization channel, including this very paper, has shown a trajectory that moves 'backwards' along both axes, over time widening the visualization context to encompass less crisply defined problems and more subjective information location.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Interaction between channels</head><p>We contend that interactions between channels are mutually beneficial and indeed necessary to exploit the full potential of visualization. In particular we find that trajectories that may involve transferring information from the computer to 'domain expert' (i.e., moving left in the task-information space), can result in rich and fruitful contributions to other, more analytical discourse channels. This should not surprise us too much -passive 'visualization awareness' activities are used to stimulate ideas through analogy in human-centered visualization design <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. What we emphasize here is that a design team's parallel work on multiple forms of discourse relating to the same problem domain can result in unpredictable, but constructive, interventions that influence design processes.</p><p>These broad approaches to a design problem may increase the likelihood of serendipity. Blanford and Makri <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> define this as "a mix of unexpectedness and insight and has the potential to lead to a valuable outcome". In visualization design that takes the trajectory described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, a collective aim is the outcome involving insight. In the activities described here this has resulted in those involved in design and analysis getting to know data and a domain better and those primarily interested in data getting to know data and visualization techniquesa useful convergence of knowledge.</p><p>In our case, TfL brought policy expertise, partial knowledge of usage patterns and potentially conflicting problem definitions (e.g., revenue generation, changing transport culture, perceived personal safety). While their focus may not have been on using novel visualization techniques, they were equipped with a high degree of spatial literacy and knowledge when interpreting map views of the transport networks in London, allowing us to design map-based views with minimal geographic annotation. As academic contributors we offered some visualization expertise but also transport theory expertise and overlapping imperfect knowledge of usage patterns. This overlapping understanding between the groups was an important factor in building trust, and participation in multiple discourse channels helped establish this. Individuals may have membership of more than one of those roles or their position may change over time, as may the individuals involved. As such, the widely used distinction reported in the visualization literature between 'visualization experts' and 'domain experts' seems not to fit well with many of the interactions described here so we challenge the value of this dichotomy in our context.</p><p>Additionally we argue that in establishing knowledge and developing approaches, the unexpected can contribute effectively to design decisions and analytical pathways. In our experience parallel visualization efforts made via additional discourse channels through which rich interaction and broad channels of engagement are achieved can contribute very effectively to these. For example, the effect of the public engagement channel, with the New Scientist endorsed bicycle movie becoming something of a visualization meme in TfL, helped establish interest and confidence in our more standard visualization efforts and may have resulted in greater buy-in from TfL colleagues and management as analysis progressed. The authority established via the Transport Policy channel unexpectedly gave rise to discourse with the Museum of London which in turn was fed by artistic activity at Digital Shoreditch. This presented new ways for the Museum to link themes of the personal (both as cyclists in the city and as the artist/analyst's self-expression) with 'big data' and visualization. These may be regarded as externalities as defined by <ref type="bibr">Robinson [41]</ref>, but we argue that many of these may be internalised by explicitly recognizing multiple channels of engagement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Channels as a contribution to project success</head><p>One of the scientific challenges faced in evaluating the impact of multichannel interactions is in isolating the factors influencing project outcomes. We have argued that there have been clear examples of one channel's activities having beneficial impacts on another, but we must also consider other possible drivers of project success. It may be that the geospatial domain considered here lends itself particularly well to engaging visual representation, especially through the familiar paradigm of the map. Similarly, exploring temporal change through animation is both visually engaging and a cognitively plausible design choice. We also acknowledge that careful selection of appropriate visual metaphors and encodings to support them has played an important part of several of our successful outcomes. Yet the framework of discourse channels has allowed us to target design decisions for different purposes and audiences while borrowing the gains made in other channels. The approach also allows a degree of risk mitigation in that a parallel approach accommodates 'project failures' in some channels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We present a wider interpretation of the design study model that reflects our open and flexible approach to using visualization in a variety of contexts. It acknowledges the evolving and overlapping roles played by those who both consume and produce visualization.</p><p>Reporting on this work within the confines of data and task abstractions, visual encoding and insight development, misses the many other influences from parallel activities. The long-term nature of our engagement with the LCHS and the substantial packages of work we developed outside of conventional data analysis has led us to define and advocate parallel channels of discourse. Acknowledging that external influences apply to almost all visualization projects, we find that characterizing these influences may help designing successful visualization projects.</p><p>Our argument is that these channels are often complementary and that synergies exist between the highly analytical and more personally expressive work. We argue that many pipeline-focussed models of design omit these important influences and opportunities and that may be costly in terms of the way visualization practitioners operate.</p><p>Our approach considers design as part of a richer range of engagements leading to deeper analytical insight, protecting against possible design pitfalls that may occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and even use them as an opportunity to influence an existing design or stimulate an alternative role for visualization. In short it seems that parallel channels of discourse provide excellent opportunity for sharing knowledge and perspectivesa basis upon which to develop new design studies. They additionally offer a rich and important source for serendipity that can beneficially influence ways in which this is achieved at a number of levels.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Timeline of the seven channels of discourse.
