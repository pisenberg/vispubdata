<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The fundamental role of visualization in the exploration of scientific data has over the years become indisputable, and documented successes of visualization as an enabling technology across many disciplines create a solid foundation for the research field. Interactive data visualization also serves an increasingly important role in science communication and general outreach to broad audiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. The use of exploratory visualization in public spaces such as museums and science centers is elaborated upon by Ynnerman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. Recently, advances in computer hardware, increased availability of data, and improvements in visualization methodology have changed the traditional approach to science communication based on explanatory visualization to include elements of interactive data exploration. The neologism "Exploranation" denotes this convergence of exploration and explanation <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. Additionally, the need for explanatory approaches in scientific data exploration and documentation is also increasing as interactive visualization is maturing in many application domains as part of the workflow. The software OpenSpace <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for astrovisualization is positioned in the middle of this ongoing evolution of science communication. It can be used as an interactive science communication tool for live presentations in situations ranging from planetarium and dome theater shows to classroom teaching and individual exploration on personal computers. It is, however, also used as an exploration tool in space and astronomy research in conjunction with other analysis tools and indeed has shown to be powerful in team communication and collaboration.</p><p>An important aspect of visualization at this intersection of exploration and explanation is the need for accurate visual context. In traditional science communication, explanatory visualization context and use of realism in visual metaphors provide real-world context. It has been shown that for novice users and learners context and completeness significantly aids in the formulation of mental models <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. This need carries over to the use of interactive data exploration for broad audiences and calls for significant emphasis on context and realism. The notion of scientific exploration is based on data-driven approaches, while at the same time, contextual content that maintains realism must also be based on data visualization. Inevitably this means that there is a need for approaches to visual representations that are positioned at the intersection of realistic graphics and data visualization. In this paper we present such an approach and present how realistic looking atmospheres can provide context and support interactive exploration of data from space exploration missions and astronomical observations. As the developed model and visualization is data-driven and configurable, it itself is a tool for exploration of the parameter spaces involved in light transport in differing planetary atmospheres and an example of how the "exploranation" process works in both ways. To achieve this, we implemented a highly configurable parametric system inside OpenSpace <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The domain expert can interactively calibrate the physical parameters of the atmosphere based on sensed or computed atmospheric data and visualize the results in real-time from any angle and position.</p><p>Our paper has three main contributions. First, we propose a novel atmospheric model whose main goal is to support a unified parameterized model capable of rendering the atmospheres of different planets and exoplanets with high accuracy. Second, we give an efficient open-source implementation of our new model that is able to run at interactive rates on existing graphics hardware. Finally, we validate our model with realworld data (when available) from Earth's and Mars' atmospheres as well as real-world images from these planets. The validation is based on luminance results from Earth's atmosphere for different Sun's positions are plotted against the theoretical model provided by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>The faithful visualization of planetary atmospheres has been a long time focus of the scientific community. The atmospheric effects can improve the understanding of the Earth and other planetary systems and help to understand different techniques of realistic visualization, providing the appropriate context for them <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In this scenario, realistic atmospheric effects are the main aim for scientists working with realtime astronomic visualization and education aiding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Atmospheric Models and Rendering</head><p>Modeling realistic rendering of atmospheres is a vast field and can be classified by two orthogonal types: offline/real-time and single/multiple scattering. Offline Single Scattering Nishita et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> were one of the first to approach the problem of rendering realistic atmospheres. In their work, the path of a light ray through the atmosphere and its energy contribution is calculated by numerical integration on the CPU that is partially cached in lookup tables. Their model does not account for multiple scattering, prohibit height-dependent atmospheric density changes, and the atmosphere can only be rendered from the outside.</p><p>The work of Riley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> proposes an analytical solution through the use of multiple scattering phase functions to model the angular dependency of the scattering events (Mie scattering effects are simulated by the use of specific phase functions for water vapor and dust). In Riley's solution, only single scattering effects were considered for an observer inside the atmosphere (on the ground). Also, no transitions between the ground and space were considered. Real-Time Single Scattering Hoffman et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> work extends the solution by Nishita to provide interactive frame rates. They considered the Earth's atmosphere density constant and made strong approximations of the radiative transfer equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref> (exchanging integral calculations by multiplication of factors).</p><p>Based on the work of Nishita <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> et al., O'Neil <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> proposed an algorithm to generate a real-time approximation of the Earth's atmosphere. He used a 2D lookup table for storing the optical depth and a 3D lookup table to store a precomputed single scattering integral. In O'Neil's next work <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, he eliminated the lookup tables. He approximated the single scattering equations by evaluating the integrals using a low sampling approach in the shader, using the graphics hardware to interpolate the atmosphere's final colors value. This latter method obtained good results in real-time and was also capable of rendering the atmosphere from any viewpoint on the ground or in space.</p><p>The model by Schafhitzel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> also uses a precomputation model of the single scattering integral, and stores it as a lookup table (as suggested by O'Neil), thus accessing it by a smaller number of parameters (the view and Sun zenith angle). The small number of parameters in the parametrization of the table (the angle between the sun position and the view direction is not available in their solution) prevents the final model from displaying the Earth's shadow inside the atmosphere.</p><p>To correctly reproduce colors in the twilight, multiple scattering of the light must be considered as the light traverses more atmosphere during the twilight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Offline Multiple Scattering</head><p>Following their previous work, Nishita <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> used volume radiosity methods that divide the sky hemisphere in cells to take multiple light scattering effects into account. This enables the generation of images for observers inside or outside the atmosphere, and produces visually suitable images but takes a long time to generate a static image as it consumes a large amount of computational resources and is thus not suitable for a real-time system.</p><p>Applying a Monte-Carlo simulation technique on an analytical model, Preetham et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> presented a solution for the multiple scattering problem. Their model produces good images for an observer on the ground but is not capable of generating images for an observer outside the atmosphere. Also, as Zotti et al. pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, the model has some incorrect behavior producing negative intensities for some cases.</p><p>Horsek <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> et al.</p><p>proposed an analytical atmospheric model that improves Preetham's model <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. They improved the final analytical formula by adding more degrees of freedom for the fitting phase. They added new parameters to the model besides the turbidity (an indirect measure of the number of suspended particles in a medium) and executed all the calculations in a fully spectral model, enabling the model to handle different illumination spectrums.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Real-time Multiple Scattering</head><p>The atmospheric model of Bruneton et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, which our work extends, improves the model of Schafhitzel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> adding a 4 th parameter (the cosine of the angle between the Sun position and the view direction) for the lookup table and an incremental algorithm for precomputing the radiance contribution due to multiple scattering light effects. Because of the precomputation nature and the lookup tables, Bruneton's model is capable of running in real-time and produces very good results. The atmospheric model proposed does not account for molecular anisotropic, Mie scattering wavelength dependency, and the absorption of energy by molecules (e.g., the oxygen and ozone molecules).</p><p>In a similar model to Bruneton's model, Elek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> presented a real-time algorithm for the rendering of planetary atmospheres. Their model can simulate multiple scattering light effects and also uses an incremental algorithm for the precomputation of the final radiance value. Unlike Bruneton, their calculations do not take the angle between the Sun and the view direction into account, so they cannot reproduce the Earth's shadow inside the atmosphere.</p><p>Extending their previous work, Elek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> included the effect of scattering in water, through the use of a different attenuation coefficient, and variable atmospheric density, rewriting the Rayleigh and Mie scattering coefficients as functions of the molecular number density, utilizing fully spectral data. Similar to Bruneton and Neyret <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Elek et al. do not consider Mie wavelength dependency or absorption of radiant energy.</p><p>The simulation of a correct physically-based atmospheric model is a complex task, as many physical effects impact each photon passing through the participating media. The formulation of an entirely accurate real-time model for realistic rendering of atmospheres is infeasible. However, our goal is to focus on the primary process needed to visualize the planetary atmospheres with interactive controls correctly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Visualization of Atmospheric Models</head><p>The visualization of atmospheric models can be grouped into two categories that each has its own distinct requirements.</p><p>The first category concerns the visualization of observed, measured, and simulated data interacting with an atmospheric model. For instance, weather visualization and prediction consist of some of the most well-known systems and toolkits: Vis5D, VisAD, D3D, NASA's Atmosphere, the Globe program, and NOAA's Weather and Climate Toolkit <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Because these systems are aimed at the visualization of layered and volumetric data, they often lack important visual information that is crucial when visually analyzing atmospheres such as: Rayleigh and Mie scattering effects, aerial perspective, and others which help the consumer of the visualization with its context.</p><p>The software packages used for the visualization of astronomical/astrophysical data and topological information are in the second category. Among them, capable of displaying planetary surfaces and atmospheres are Uniview <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, Digistar from Evans and Sutherland, Celestia, Stellarium, Gaia Sky <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, and Space Engine. These systems have different capabilities when displaying atmospheric effects. However, they lack advanced parameter control and higher-order effects such as multiple scattering, or the description of the atmospheric model in use is not available. The same category also includes the Google Maps/Earth systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, which are capable of rendering the atmospheres of Earth, Mars, and Venus in real-time, but lack controls for the user or any indication of the atmospheric model used to produce the results. Among 3D natural scene simulators, Proland is a real-time system capable of rendering Earth's atmosphere using the atmospheric model and rendering algorithm created by Bruneton et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">BACKGROUND</head><p>This section explains the fundamental concepts of radiative transfer physics and their applications in atmospheric physics rendering.</p><p>The light interactions inside a medium can be described by two distinct approaches: phenomenological <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref> and microphysical <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. In the following description, we use the former approach. When the radiant energy (photons in a light ray of wavelength λ ) travels through a medium, it can be absorbed, scattered, or emitted. The energy is extinct (absorbed + scattered) when photons hit a molecule or particle, or when part of the initial energy is absorbed. The fraction of absorbed energy is represented by the absorption coefficient β abs (λ ), and described in differential form as the rate of change of energy (the radiance: the radiant flux per unit solid angle per unit projected area) per unit of length in the direction of solid angle ω (traveling direction) at a point x. The fraction of energy scattered in different directions other than ω (also known as out-scattered radiant energy) is described by the scattering coefficient β scat (λ ) and, similarly to the absorption, can be formulated in differential form too:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( ω • ∇)L( x, ω, λ ) = −(β abs (λ ) + β scat (λ )) extinction coefficient β ext ( y) • L( x, ω, λ ) incoming radiance<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Previously scattered energy may be in-scattered into the current traveling direction, increasing the radiant energy of that ray. The change in radiance due to in-scattering can be written in differential form by adding all radiant energy arriving at point x from the whole sphere of directions weighted by the scattering coefficient:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">( ω • ∇)L( x, ω, λ ) = 4π β scat (λ )P( x, ω , ω)L( x, ω , λ )d ω<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The term P( x, ω , ω) = P(cosθ ) is known as the phase function, which describes the angular distribution of light intensity being scattered. For isotropic scattering, radiant energy is scattered uniformly in all directions and the phase function is constant. In this paper, we consider molecules and particles that exhibit dominant scattering directions i.e., anisotropic scattering. Combining Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 and adding an emission term W e ( x, ω, λ ), yields the radiative transfer equation (RTE):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">( ω • ∇)L( x, ω, λ ) = −(β abs (λ ) + β scat (λ ))L( x, ω, λ ) +W e ( x, ω, λ ) + 4π β scat (λ )P( x, ω , ω)L( x, ω , λ )d ω<label>(3)</label></formula><p>This work does not consider media capable of emitting radiant energy, so W e ( x, ω, λ ) = 0. With the rendering equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> as a boundary condition, Eq. 3 can be written as a purely integral equation for the radiance in the presence of participating media:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L( x, ω, λ ) = extinction T ( x, x 0 )L( x 0 , − ω, λ ) + x 0 x T ( x, y) 4π β scat (λ )P( x, ω , ω)L( x, ω , λ )d ω dy in-scattering (4)</formula><p>The transmittance T ( x, x 0 ) is the result of solving the differential equation 1 and is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">T ( x, x 0 ) = exp − x 0 x β ext ( y)dy optical depth (5)</formula><p>Finally, it should be noted that the radiant energy lost by the outscattering effect is not converted to other energy forms; this radiant energy travels further through the atmospheric medium and may be scattered into another beam of light. This way, the out-scattering light is accounted for by the extinction process and the in-scattering light.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Atmospheric Physics</head><p>In the case of planetary atmospheres as the medium of interaction with the light, Eq. 4 must the extended to take into account the contributions of the radiant energy arriving at an observer from the reflection at a point on the planet's surface. This new contributing radiance, R( x, ω, λ ), is the attenuated (by Eq. 5) sum of all radiant energy arriving at point x 0 (hemisphere) reflected to the observer direction (solid angle ω), weighted by the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) f ( x, ω , ω) of the planet's surface and the cosine between the normal at the point x 0 and the ray incoming direction ω :</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">R( x, ω, λ ) = T ( x, x 0 ) 2π f ( x, ω , ω)( n( x 0 ) • ω )L( x, ω , λ )d ω<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Small particles (molecules and atoms) and large particles (radius between 10 nm and 50 µm <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>) are the primary sources of atmospheric absorption and scattering (we don't consider inelastic scattering (Raman scattering) in this work, i.e., scattered photons have the same frequency and wavelength as the incident photons). The particles' absorption and scattering coefficients in an atmosphere are described by the Rayleigh and Mie scattering theories. Rayleigh scattering [55] β scat R (λ ) and P R ( x, ω , ω), describes the scattering of radiant energy by molecules whose radius r is very small (x 1, x = (2πr)/λ ) compared to the wavelength λ of the incident light. Mie's theory describes the scattering (β scat M (λ ) and P M ( x, ω , ω)) and absorption β abs M (λ ) of radiant energy by large particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref> (the term large is related to the size of the particle radius to the wavelength of the incident light on the particle). Mie's theory is more general than Rayleigh's theory and explains the interactions between radiant energy and particles through the perspective of Maxwell's equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Combining this information yields the extended volume rendering equation for the light interacting with the atmospheric medium of a planet:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L( x, ω, λ ) = L 0 ( x, ω,λ ) T ( x, x 0 )L( x 0 , − ω, λ ) + T ( x, x 0 ) • I( x, ω)= f ( x, ω , ω)•E( x, ω,λ ) f ( x, ω , ω) 2π L( x, ω , λ ) • ( n( x 0 ) • ω )d ω + x 0 x T ( x, y) 4π ∑ i∈{R,M} β scat i (λ )P i ( y, ω , ω)L( y, ω , λ )d ω d y J( x, ω) S( x, ω,λ ) (7)</formula><p>Eq. 7 represents the radiance arriving at an observer at point x, looking at point x 0 (direction v), with the sun at position s; and can be written as a series of linear operators:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">L( x, ω, λ ) = L 0 ( x, ω, λ ) + R( x, ω, λ ) + S( x, ω, λ ) L( x, ω, λ ) = (L 0 + R[L] + S[L])( x, ω, λ ) L = L 0 + (R + S)[L 0 ] + (R + S)[(R + S)[L 0 ]] + . . . L = L 0 + L 1 + L 2 + . . .<label>(8)</label></formula><p>The i th term in Eq. 8 corresponds to the light reflected and scattered i times, if i &gt; 1 these are known as multiple scattering terms.</p><p>In the following sections, we describe the atmospheric model we derived and implemented to realistically describe the Rayleigh and Mie scattering processes in atmospheres of planets and exoplanets.</p><p>An atmospheric model can be described in two parts: the way the radiant energy is scattered and the way it is absorbed inside the atmosphere.</p><p>In our model for realistic visualization of atmospheres, we take a starting point in the previous works in the literature and extend it to account for the absorption of energy by different molecules, describing how the molecules of ozone and oxygen absorb radiant energy in Earth's atmosphere. We then propose a general method for the absorption of radiant energy by molecules based on results from Maxwell's equation and the adoption of complex indices of refraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In the case of large particles, we propose using the anomalous diffraction approximation for absorbing spheres offered by van de Hust <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>  We modeled the scattering and absorption of radiant energy for large particles (10nm &lt; r &lt; 50µm) using an extended Double Henyey-Greenstein three-parameter phase function <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> to account for wavelength dependency, and a scattering coefficient dependent of the inverse square of the wavelength of the incident light <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>For Earth, we use the air mass coefficient and the distance between the ground and the top of the atmosphere to calculate the approximate length traveled by a light ray inside the atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p><p>In our work, we generate only clear sky images but it is possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> to account for other weather variations by adding clouds using height and type information (the clouds in our generated images are textures with no optical properties), and considering their light interaction in the atmospheric model. Other weather variations can be obtained considering the contributions of different aerosols throughout the atmospheric model. To simplify the proposed model and yield real-time frame rates, the diffuse radiation field contribution from the ocean is not considered.</p><p>The following sections describe these features in detail, and how to put them together to yield our proposed atmospheric model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Scattering by Molecules and Atoms</head><p>As discussed in Sect. 3.1, the loss of radiant energy is described as a combination of the absorption and out-scattering effects inside the atmosphere. It is well known that different particles have different scattering and absorption properties for the different parts of the light spectrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>. In this work, we are only concerned with the scattering and absorption properties of particles in a specific interval of the visible spectrum of the light spectrum, i.e., light with a wavelength in the interval 440nm − 680nm. Although full spectral atmospheric model rendering is possible, we restrict our computations to the light interval above, to be able to use (and validate our model with) the different tabulated data available.</p><p>Rayleigh-Cabannes Scattering The Rayleigh scattering phase function, P R (θ ), given by Eq. 9, represents a good approximation to the angular distribution of the scattered light <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> by small particles (radius particle λ incident light ) inside the atmosphere:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P R (θ ) = 3 4 (1 + cos 2 θ ) • 1 4π<label>(9)</label></formula><p>In our atmospheric model, instead of using Eq. 9, like previous atmospheric models in the literature, we used the Rayleigh phase function approximation given by Penndorf <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, which takes into account the anisotropy of the atmosphere molecules and effects of polarisability (through the fitting of experimental data) and use Eq. 10.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">P R (θ ) = 0.7629(1 + 0.932 • cos 2 θ ) • 1 4π (10)</formula><p>Together with the Rayleigh scattering coefficient β scat R (λ ) = β scat R (0, λ ) in Eq. 11, we can effectively describe the Rayleigh scattering process:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">β scat R (h, λ ) = 8π 3 (n(λ ) 2 − 1) 2 3Nλ 4 • f (δ ) • e − h H R m −1 , f (δ ) = 6 + 3δ 6 − 7δ<label>(11)</label></formula><p>In Eq. 11, λ , n(λ ), and N are the wavelength of the incident light, the medium's refractive index, and the molecular density at sea level, respectively. Further, in Eq. 11, the exponential term describes the atmospheric density variation with height and is formally known as hydrostatic concentration function. The scale height H R is the atmosphere's thickness if its density were uniform and h is the atmospheric height relative to the surface.</p><p>For maximum parametrization, the molecular density and scale height can be input as functions of the mean molecular mass M, and the mean mass density ρ, of the atmosphere's gases. Thus, H = RT /Mg and N = (N A • ρ m )/M (T is the temperature, and R, N A , and g are ideal gas constant, Avogadro's number, and the acceleration due to gravity on the planet's surface). This highly parameterized way to describe the atmospheric model gives the user better control over the final results.</p><p>Because we considered the existence of anisotropic molecules in the atmosphere, we applied the correction given by the function f (δ ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> in Eq. 11. The depolarization factor δ is slightly wavelength-dependent and varies for different molecules. In this work we consider it constant in the atmosphere. Note that the Rayleigh phase function is dependent on the wavelength 1/λ 4 , i.e., shorter wavelengths are scattered more than long wavelengths.

However, for an observer close to the ground inside Mars' atmosphere, the aerosol particles (dust) tend to be most prevalent <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and Mie scattering dominates Rayleigh scattering.

In a window resolution of 1920×1080 pixels, the GBuffer structures consume approximately 71.2 MB of VRAM (1920 × 1080 × 3(buffers) × 3(RGB)×32(bits)), while the precomputation textures consume around 12.2 MB of VRAM (transmittance texture: 256×64, irradiance texture: 64×32, and in-scattering texture: (256 = 32 • 8)×128 × 32).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">APPLICATION</head><p>As described in the introduction, the use of an atmospheric model serves multiple purposes and is an essential component for the use of OpenSpace as a science communication platform as well as a tool <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>. The rendering times for frames of Earth during a playback of recorded flight path. The red curve shows the average frame time (in ms) using our method, while the blue curve is the time to render the same frame without an atmosphere enabled.Images A-D are stills captured at the corresponding time locations in the graph for scientific exploration. An example of a science communication situation is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 9</ref>, where students are exploring the martian surface in a dome theater. The atmospheric effects shown on the dome create an immersive experience and thus contribute to a high level of engagement and involvement. The high performance of the model presented in this paper supports interactive frame rates at 8K resolution, which is needed in modern multi projector planetarium configurations. Rendering of realistic looking atmospheres is thus an essential component in the wide spread use of interactive astrovisualization in science communication at planetariums and science centers.</p><p>Another example of science exploration and communication use is dome sessions with the Mars 2020 rover science definition team chaired by Jack Mustard, Professor of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences and Professor of Environmental Studies, Brown University, who used OpenSpace for exploration and presentations of the criteria for landing spot selections. The atmosphere provided visual context when reviewing different potential landing sites.</p><p>We also foresee that the OpenSpace atmosphere model will enable rapid production of rendering of planets in wide spread science communication of the continued exploration of the solar system conducted by science institutions and space agencies. An exciting future use is the production of realistic looking imagery of exoplanets based on scientific data collection and simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this work we presented a new method for physically-based visualization of planetary atmospheres. Our method uses a new advanced atmospheric model capable of simulating the absorption of radiant energy by small and large particles comparable to the wavelength of the incident light, modeling different properties of dust particles based on their refractive index and radius. In Earth's case, our atmospheric model can simulate non-linear paths of the light inside the atmosphere. Although our method requires modeling absorption by particles of the same size, more than one type of particle (size) can be added by simple addition of absorption coefficients.</p><p>We validated our method using data from CIE and visual comparisons with pictures taken from Mars' atmosphere by NASA. Finally, our method is designed to be used by domain experts, students, and the general public, generating images in real-time.</p><p>Future work includes adding the sun's limb darkening effect, adding the light contribution of the stars and Moon, improving the reflection BRDF (Hapke's BRDF <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>), and adding weather effects and clouds. More ambitious improvements include handling polarization effects for each light interaction and using Mie's equations to calculate the exact scattering phase function.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Light absorbing molecules influence the atmosphere's visual character.
