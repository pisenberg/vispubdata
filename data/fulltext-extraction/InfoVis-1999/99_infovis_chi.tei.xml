			<abstract>
				<p>In the process of knowledge discovery, workers examine available information in order to make sense of it. By sensemaking, we mean interacting with and operating on the information with a variety of information processing mechanisms [3,18]. Previously, we introduced a concept that uses the spreadsheet metaphor with cells containing visualizations of complex data. In this paper, we extend and apply a cognitive model called &quot;visual sensemaking&quot; to the Visualization Spreadsheet. We use the task of making sense of a large Web site as a concrete example through out the paper for demonstration. Using a variety of visualization techniques, such as the Disk Tree and Cone Tree, we show that the interactions of the Visualization Spreadsheet help users draw conclusions from the overall relationships of the entire information set.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>A graphic is not "drawn" once and for all; it is "constructed" and reconstructed until it reveals all the relationships constituted by the interplay of the data.... A graphic is never an end in itself; it is a moment in the process of decision-making. -Jacques Bertin <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> In the present and the past, knowledge workers have utilized various technologies to reduce the cost of accessing, processing, and understanding large data sets. The vision of Vannevar Bush's 'MEMEX' was to enable workers to make sense of information by employing technology that allow them to "make real use of the record" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> by extracting relationships between pieces of information. Recently, researchers have shown that information visualization techniques are capable of communicating vast amounts of information very quickly <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Typically this is accomplished by carefully examining the task requirements and then designing an application that fits the needs of the user.</p><p>The exploratory nature of many tasks suggests that we need to construct an environment that provides a set of data and graphic processing primitives that users can employ as needed.</p><p>The techniques of information processing play an equally important role in enabling users to make sense of the data.</p><p>Since the structure of many exploratory tasks is iterative <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, the environment needs to support cyclic processes. These processing techniques include visualization interactions that directly manipulate the displayed information. Thus, we have identified both the needs for an exploratory information visualization environment as well as a user cognitive model.</p><p>In this paper, we extend and apply a cognitive model called "sensemaking" to an information visualization environment called the "Visualization Spreadsheet." Previously, we presented the Visualization Spreadsheet as an information visualization environment capable of integrating various information visualization techniques in a single system <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. We also presented an interaction and operator framework for visualization systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, as well as a single-view application for visualizing Web site traffic evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In this paper, we use the "Visual Sensemaking" model to show the advantages of the Visualization Spreadsheet in real-world analysis scenarios involving usage patterns of Web sites. We:</p><p>1. Extend the sensemaking cognitive task model to information visualization.</p><p>2. Apply the visualization operator framework called "Data State Model" to Web site usage analysis.</p><p>3. Demonstrate visual sensemaking in specific Web site analysis tasks in the Visualization Spreadsheet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Analyze the advantages of the Visualization</head><p>Spreadsheet from the visual sensemaking perspective.</p><p>To ensure the reality of our analysis scenarios, we use a large 15,000 file Web site associated with hundreds of megabytes of real-world usage information. The Web site is constantly changing, and our discoveries are direct results of needed sensemaking tasks.</p><p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows.</p><p>In Section 2, we introduce some background on Web visualizations and the Visualization Spreadsheet. Section 3 describes the visual sensemaking cycle. Section 4 describes the operators in the Web analysis system. In Section 5, we show how to use the spreadsheet in visual sensemaking of the Xerox.com web site.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background</head><p>In this section, we present related work to Web visualization and introduce the Visualization Spreadsheet.</p><p>Site administrators want to discover usage patterns of their Web sites so that they can more effectively deliver information to users. Marketing strategists would also like to mine information about users, such as product interest. Users need tools to navigate and locate information faster. To support these tasks, various researchers have visualized hypertext spaces using various methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Each system is designed for specific tasks, and has enabled users to better understand Web spaces.</p><p>Our targeted users include Web analysts, marketers, advertisers, Webmasters, and administrators, who have a need to reduce the cost of accessing millions of pieces of related usage information. We hope that, by reducing their cost of comprehending this immense amount of dynamic Web data, we will enable sensemaking tasks to be performed much faster than before. Since Web sites and their associated usage data change daily, this cost-structure reduction is critical in maintaining timely Web sites.</p><p>We use the visualization spreadsheet paradigm in the sensemaking of Web sites. We present a visualization application called the Web Analysis Visualization Spreadsheet (WAVS) that enables the processing and subsequent understanding of an evolving Web site's content, usage, topology, and rating (CUTR). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the WAVS system during one step of the analysis.</p><p>The spreadsheet metaphor provides a structured, intuitive, and powerful interface for exploratory data analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Spreadsheets have proven to be highly successful environments for interacting with numeric data by providing an environment that easily affords the application of a variety of operators and the definition of data dependencies. The concept of the Visualization Spreadsheet <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> is based on three characteristics:</p><p>(1) Grid: The tabular layout lets users view collections of visualizations simultaneously. The Visualization Spreadsheet displays the visualization of an arbitrarily large data set in each cell.</p><p>(2) Operators: Operators are available for generating or modifying cell contents. Operators can be applied across a specified range of operand cells, such as an entire column or row.</p><p>(3) Dependency: The spreadsheet keeps track of the dependencies between cells and automatically updates the cells appropriately when they are manipulated.</p><p>We can integrate a variety of different visualization techniques together in a single system and allow it to be user-programmable, so that it can be tailored to many analysis situations.</p><p>For the purpose of this paper, we will examine the application of WAVS to the evolving Xerox.com Web site over a one-year period, which contains roughly 15,000 files and their associated evolving attributes. We use visualization techniques such as the Disk Tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and Cone Tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> to show the Web site structures and associated usage data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Cognitive Model: Visual Sensemaking Cycle</head><p>Information is the reply to a question. -Jacques Bertin <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> In this section, we apply concepts from the sensemaking cognitive model to information visualization. We use the Web analysis task as an example to demonstrate how these concepts can be used productively in this particular data domain. We can generalize to other data domains with this cognitive framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Stages of Visual Sensemaking</head><p>The central concept in sensemaking is that users perform operations to gain successive understanding of the information. In order to model this process, Bertin mentions the five major stages of decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. We extend these five major stages to define the finer-grained nine-stage visual sensemaking cycle, which is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>. The gray boxes denote Bertin's five stages of decision-making. The other four boxes denote the added finer grain stages.</p><p>1. Defining the problem: An analyst, when faced with a problem, first defines the problem by asking certain questions. Often the questions are formed in the context of a hypothesis. E.g. are certain areas of the Web site accessed more than other areas? Do the access patterns in these areas change over time?</p><p>2. Defining the data: Once the problem is framed in the context of hypotheses, we must now gather the raw data that are necessary for answer the questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Choosing an analytical abstraction:</head><p>The raw data must be organized into data structures for easy access and query later. E.g. we extract the Web linkage information into graphs represented using adjacency lists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Choosing visualization abstractions:</head><p>We know certain data abstractions are visualizable. Depending on the structure of the analytical abstractions and the visualization techniques that are available to us, we can choose among a variety of visualization abstractions. Alternatively, new techniques can be invented to visualize new abstractions. E.g. we know that visualizing a graph of on the order of 100 nodes is difficult. Unfortunately, the Web graphs we are dealing with are on the order of 10,000 nodes. To solve this problem and in order to take advantage of the hierarchical nature of the Xerox Web site, we choose a hierarchical representation for our visualization abstraction. We show back links as detail-on-demand.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Adopting a processing language:</head><p>The next step in visual sensemaking is to determine the operators that are appropriate for the task. We will describe this in detail in Section 4. For an example, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Transcribe the value into view:</head><p>This stage is essentially the execution of the visualization pipeline to generate a new visualization state. The user sees visualizations that shed light on the hypothesis that was posed in stage 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7.</head><p>Processing the value or view: At this stage, we perform certain interactive operators on the results, such as rotation, scaling, detail-on-demand zooming, or valuefiltering. Specific visual features will grab the users' attention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Interpret and deciding:</head><p>The users cognitively process the visualization in order to understand the visual features in these specific views.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Iterate:</head><p>After some new understanding of the data, further hypotheses will be formed, and new visualizations will then need to be constructed to answer those questions. The process repeats until the analyst is satisfied that she has completely made sense of the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Information Level</head><p>The aim in the above visual sensemaking cycle is to successively discover new higher-level knowledge in the information. The visual sensemaking cycle can be viewed a "Knowledge Crystallization" task <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This requires the discovery of new relationships between information subsets in each cycle. Using the information level as a measuring stick, we can gain understanding of how effective a visualization system is in uncovering new knowledge.</p><p>Taking the information level concept together with the visual sensemaking cycle, we can better model the exploratory nature of many tasks. We showed Web analysis to be one such task. In the next section, we define  the processing operators in this task. These operators are what enabled us to carry out the real-world analysis scenarios in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Web Analysis in the Visualization Framework</head><p>To use the Visualization Spreadsheet, we developed the "Data State Model" for identifying, categorizing, and analyzing visualization operators <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Using this framework, we developed a set of hypertext visualization operators, which forms the operating primitives for conducting iterative cyclic analysis tasks on the Web.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Web Analysis in the Data State Model</head><p>The visualization operator framework places operators in the context of the information visualization pipeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. Value is converted and transformed into four major stages: Value, Analytical Abstraction, Visualization Abstraction, and View (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). In between each of these four stages, there are three major processing steps: Data Transformation, Visualization Transformation, and Visual Mapping Transformation (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stage Description</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Value</head><p>The raw data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical Abstraction</head><p>Processed data that is not yet mappable but include all information from the raw data that will be visualized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visualization Abstraction</head><p>Information that is visualizable on the screen using a visualization technique.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>View</head><p>The end-product of the visualization mapping, where the user sees and interprets the picture presented to her. Visualization operators operate on data sets in each of the four stages. The classification of visualization operators shows that each operator either performs a transformation that takes information between stages, or generates another data set within the same stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. For example, a valuefiltering operator selects a subset of the data and produces a new data set within the same stage. Between stage operators are called Transformation Operators:</p><p>Processing Steps</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Transformation</head><p>Generates some form of analytical abstraction from the value (usually by extraction).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visualization Transformation</head><p>Takes an analytical abstraction and further reduces it into some form of visualization abstraction, which is visualizable content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visual Mapping Transformation</head><p>The Visual Mapping Transformation takes information that is in a visualizable format and presents a graphical view to the user. We applied this framework to the Xerox Web site:</p><p>Value: For the exploration of Web ecologies, we chose the Xerox Web site over a one-year period from April 1997 to May 1998. The Xerox web site contains roughly 7,500 HTML pages and 8,000 non-HTML items. The hyperlink topologies and usage information were recorded on a daily basis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical Abstraction:</head><p>Content: The words in the page as well as clusters of items</p><p>Usage: For each file, the frequency of page requests was aggregated using one-week intervals. The transition matrix, or hop count, from one node to another was also computed</p><p>Topology: The hyperlink structure of the site was extracted from the HTML pages.</p><p>Rating: For each file, we compute its similarity or relevance to other files using Spreading Activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visualization Abstraction:</head><p>Tree: The result of the Breadth First Traversal is a hierarchy of items with back links. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3: Information Visualization Operator Framework applied to Web Analysis</head><p>Activation is computed over the evolving document collection, which enables the comparison of results from different time periods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Classification of Web Analysis Operators</head><p>Using the Data State Model as a basis, we classified and studied operators in the Web analysis domain. At the heart of the WAVS system is the set of Web analysis visualization operators. The operators are significant because the operators that are applicable to a wide variety of different analysis scenarios for understanding a Web site's content, usage, topological, rating patterns. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> contains a depiction of the framework with some Web analysis operators. We present the details of Web analysis operators in the context of this framework in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">REAL-WORLD ANALYSIS SCENARIOS</head><p>In this section, we will demonstrate how the WAVS enables users to gain successive higher levels of knowledge on a large Web site.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Faddishness of Information</head><p>In previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, we showed the importance of finding various patterns of faddishness in information. A problem encountered in using the Time Tubes visualization is the choice of color scale for mapping frequency of usage. Each color scale has advantages and disadvantages. As a result, we typically found ourselves experimenting with many different color scales without finding a perfect scale.</p><p>The Visualization Spreadsheet provided the appropriate tools for experimenting with color scales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First Sensemaking Cycle: Cone Tree</head><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, we choose to threshold the color scale so that it maps values between [0,100] in Row 1, and [100, 500] in <ref type="bibr">Row 2, and [500, 2000]</ref> in Row 3. Across the columns, we show the 1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd , and 4 th week of April 1997. The 5 th column is the 3 rd week in August 1997. We use Cone Trees to show the hierarchy, and the color scale is a rainbow heat scale where red correspond to high levels of usage, and blue correspond to low levels of usage. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure  4</ref> shows two particular features that emerged in <ref type="bibr">Row</ref>   One important lesson learned from this example is the importance of being able to map values onto the structure of the spreadsheet. By using the horizontal dimension of the spreadsheet for time and the vertical dimension for various usage color scales, we externalize the variability of the two variables we are interested in correlating. Without the spreadsheet, correlating between these two variables visually is difficult. We call this process Value to Structure Mapping. By employing external cognition, we reduce the cognitive load of the user and speed up the sensemaking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Correct Creation of New Content</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Second Sensemaking Cycle: Disk Tree</head><p>After doing the interpretation step of the sensemaking cycle, we decided to try a different visual mapping transformation-the Disk Tree. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> shows the same data using Disk Trees instead of Cone Trees. Notice that while these two features are also visible on the third row, they were harder for the eye to pick up because the Disk Tree layout algorithm does not exaggerate those areas of the tree. On the other hand, it is much easier to comprehend the overall structure and usage pattern using the Disk Tree, because Disk Tree is a 2D technique that does not have occlusion problems. This example shows that different visualization techniques can contribute different senses in visual sensemaking.</p><p>Continuing with our case study, we wanted to find out why these two areas rose in usage. By brushing around the areas on the Disk Tree and examining the content, we found that on April 15, 1997, Xerox announced "New Digital Product Family Unveiled: Becomes Basis of Xerox Office Products into the Next Century" http://www.xerox.com/PR/ NR970415-newfam.html. A new product series was to present a new approach to network printing, faxing and scanning. In this press release, Xerox introduced two of its first products in this series, the Document Centre 220 and 230 Digital Copier. In looking this press release, we found a new page linked off of the root node of the web site that was the primary product page for this product series (http://www.xerox.com/Products/XDC/content.html). The details of this area are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref>. While it is immediately obvious that the pattern of usage as well as structure has changed on the 4 th week, other less obvious visual features are also noticeable after careful examination. The feature marked by a long rectangle corresponds to this new product page, and its related pages. The red coloring of this entire area shows its high usage. Because this area is new and is being used extensively, this means the area shows a correct creation of new content that is highly desirable to web users. The importance of the content is validated by the amount of attention it received.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Detail on demand</head><p>One lesson we learned from this example is the importance of allowing quick access to detailed information. The tool provides this via brushing and picking. The amount of detail displayed is programmable via the spreadsheet's interpretive command line.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parallel application of operators</head><p>Another lesson learned from this example is the usefulness of the parallel application of operators. By first selecting all of the cells in the first row, the user can simultaneously zoom, rotate, and translate to the same area of all of the Disk Trees. The spreadsheet affords this parallel operation in a natural manner, thus making the interaction easy and fast. By reducing the cost of interaction, we reduce the   users' cognitive load for view manipulation so that they can concentrate on the task at hand, rather than minute details of the interface. In terms of the visual sensemaking cycle, it is imperative that we provide fast and easy interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Surprising Increases or Decreases in Usage</head><p>So far, the interpretation of the visualizations has uncovered an interesting story around the introduction of an important product line and how it has affected the usage of the Web site. We are interested in mining for other changes in usage that may be hard to visually pick up using direct visual comparison. In order to accomplish this task, we realized that a new analytical abstraction must be computed -the subtraction of one usage pattern from another usage pattern. showing the first order difference between the weekly usage patterns. In Row 1, we show only the negative values (blue on the color scale) and only the positive values (red) in Row 2. Row 3 shows both values at the same time. The visual usage subtraction shows the rise of information for the Pagis TM and TextBridge TM home pages (marked with a yellow oval in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref>). On the other hand, the Copier's home page had increasing usage (marked with a yellow rectangle) during the second week, but not the third or fourth week. Without the visual subtraction, these trends are not at all noticeable (see the original mappings in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7a</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Validation of Web Site Design</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fourth Cycle: Relevance by Spreading Activation</head><p>As the last step in the visual sensemaking cycle, we wish to validate the web site design using spreading activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, which is an algorithm for computing the relevance between items. Using document similarity as our relevance metric, we perform spreading activation over the Web site. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref> shows the result of performing this operation over the week of <ref type="bibr">May 10, 1998</ref>. From left to right, we show the Web site in two-day intervals. In the first Disk Tree, we spread over the supplies.html page, and the red vector glyphs show that most relevant documents are within its own sub-tree (marked in yellow). In the middle Disk Tree, however, the visualization shows that there are two clusters of documents in different parts of the hierarchy that have relevance to the workgroup.html node. The third Disk Tree shows the relevant documents to the services.html node are in only one cluster. This example shows the documents in these parts of the web are placed in relatively accessible positions according to document similarity.</p><p>We have presented Web Analysis Visualization Spreadsheet (WAVS) as another example of a series of techniques we are developing for Web Ecology and Evolution Visualization (WEEV). We showed how WAVS supports a visual sensemaking cycle by presenting realworld scenarios in the context of analyzing the entire Xerox web site. We picked out visual cues that show patterns and trends in the relationships among content, usage and topology over time. By identifying the   visualization operators in web ecology analysis, we have opened the door to the answers of many interesting web site design questions. WAVS provides a web analysis workbench that provides users with a set of tools that can be combinatorically applied in various analysis tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we extended an existing cognitive model to form a new model that we call "visual sensemaking". We show how information visualization is central to this model by carefully examining the processing primitives that are employed in visual sensemaking. We analyze how the "Visualization Spreadsheet" fits in with this model. Our scenario analysis shows that the success of spreadsheetbased interaction eliminates many of the stumbling blocks in visual sensemaking, because it:</p><p>• Forms an external cognition device. We showed that, in using the spreadsheet, the user constructs the required information in each step of the visual sensemaking cycle.</p><p>Step by step, the user forms an understanding of the relationship between pieces of information. By externalizing this cognition process of sensemaking and by showing the intermediate results of each operation, the Visualization Spreadsheet is an externalized cognition device.</p><p>• Reduces the cost-structure of the analysis. The Visualization Spreadsheet allows new, ad hoc analyses to be defined quickly. By structuring a few simple rules for applying operations, the user can readily apply processing mechanisms very quickly. By carefully constructing an operator set, as we did with Web Analysis Operators, the total time spent on a study can be significantly reduced. Instead of custom programming, the spreadsheet allows a wide-range of new analyses to be defined as combination of other cells.</p><p>The power of visual sensemaking comes from the combinatorics of visualization operators. There exists a variety of ways in which the operators can be combined to answer new questions. This combination of operators covers a large conceptual space, where some concepts are not conceived ahead of time. As we have shown, the key is that the assembly of new visualizations must proceed at about the same rate as the analysis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Web Analysis Visualization Spreadsheet showing the Xerox.com web site using Cone Trees.

Overall or Global Level: This is the highest discovery level attainable from the data. The knowledge obtained at this level is condensed from the correlation between one aspect of the data with another aspect.
