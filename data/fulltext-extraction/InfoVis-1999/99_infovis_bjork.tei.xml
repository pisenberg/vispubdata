				<p>Focus+context visualization techniques aim to give users integrated visual access to both details and overview of a data set. This paper gives a systematic account of such visualization techniques. We introduce the notion that there are different orders of information visualization, with focus+context being a second-order visualization, and illustrate this with examples. We then provide a formal framework for describing and constructing focus+context visualization and relate this to the examples. A description of a software framework based on the principles of the theoretical framework follows, and we give some examples of how different focus+context visualization applications have been constructed using this framework. Finally, we discuss the implications of the formal framework and outline some future work in this area.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Information visualization is widely acknowledged as a powerful way of helping users make sense of complicated data, and a great number of methods for visualizing and working with various types of information have been presented. However, all information visualization techniques will have to comply to one inherent limitation: they will need to limit themselves to the available area of a computer screen. A common solution to this problem is to provide some kind of movable view-port to the data, which can be controlled through the manipulation of scrollbars or other means. Zooming interfaces have also been introduced to let users control the amount of data shown, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Sometimes, however, it might be important to give users access to both overview and detailed information at the same time; such techniques include <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, with separate areas for overview and detail-on-demand information.</p><p>Here, we will concentrate on a certain family of techniques, that attempt to integrate both detail and overview on the same display area in an effort to not divide the user's attention. Some terms which have been used for such techniques include fisheye views, distortion-based presentations and detail-in-context visualizations. In the following we will use the term focus+context visualizations, which is wide enough to encompass all the properties we will be discussing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Although the origin of focus+context visualization can be traced back to non-interactive distortion-based techniques for visualization of map data <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the first computer-based interactive method was introduced with the FISHEYE View <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, more known as the Generalized Fisheye View <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. This original fisheye notion was in fact a general interaction framework for information filtering according to the user's current point of interest in the material, rather than a specific visualization technique, and was shown to be applicable to various types of data, notably structured programs and tree structures. (Some confusion has been the result of several other techniques using the term "fisheye", and currently fisheye visualization is often more closely associated with distortion-based techniques that give the graphical impression of the fisheye-lens of a camera.) In connection with the Generalized Fisheye View, important concepts such as the Degree of Interest (DoI) function and the Level of Detail (LoD) were introduced.</p><p>Another early interactive example of focus+context visualization was the Bi-Focal Display <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, where a graphical focus+context display was applied to a calendar display, introducing distortion in the horizontal dimension. A somewhat similar technique, the Perspective Wall <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, used a 3D perspective to achieve the same effect. The Document Lens <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> developed the concept further by combining a perspective view with a magnifying-glass effect to give combined detail and overview presentation of a document. Other techniques that use various forms of distortion to display two-dimensional images or maps include the Graphical Fisheye View <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and Rubbersheet View <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, and forays have been made into extending such techniques to three dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Flip zooming <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> was developed to visualize sequentially ordered material, and it has been used for visualizing documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and hierarchically ordered image collections <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Techniques developed specifically for visualizing graphs and hierarchies include Hyperbolic Trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the Continuous Zoom <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and Cone Trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>Among papers seeking to classify or formalize focus+context techniques, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> is probably the most widely cited. It gives an overview of the various techniques and provides a unifying theory in the form of a rubber-sheet analogy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> introduced Space-scale diagrams as a framework for analysis of multi-scale (or zooming) interfaces, and showed that such diagrams could also be used for describing focus+context techniques. So-called Non-Linear Magnification Fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> have been introduced as an abstract representation of distortion-based magnification techniques, and these have since been more generally applied to the problem of detail-in-context visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> introduced several dimensions of transformation, X, Y, Z, and W, where the W-transformation corresponded directly to the Generalized Fisheye View.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">THE FOCUS+CONTEXT VISUALIZA-TION PROCESS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Levels of Representation</head><p>When describing information visualization, it is often sufficient to describe the underlying data, how the data is represented and what manipulation or interaction this representation will allow <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. Manipulation can be either manipulating the data itself, or, if the visualization is interactive, manipulating the way in which the data is presented. Focus+context visualizations can also be described in this way. However, we argue that it is useful to describe a focus+context visualization as a second-order visualization, i.e. a visualization of a visualization.</p><p>To clarify this, consider the rubbersheet metaphor as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Here, a focus+context visualization is compared to a sheet of rubber that has an image of some sort printed on it, e.g. a map or document. The rubbersheet is tied up in a rigid frame, representing the fixed size of the screen. Magnification of a certain area can then be achieved by stretching part of the sheet, and due the limited space available within the frame, other areas will shrink correspondingly. According to our distinction, we would say that manipulating a second-order visualization corresponds to manipulating the rubbersheet itself. Manipulating the first-order visualization, however, would correspond to some manipulation of what information is actually printed on the sheet.</p><p>This distinction is important, since in many cases it might be interesting to be able to perform manipulations at both levels of visualization. Separating the levels in this way will make the different types of interactivity clearer, and will also make it easier to account for how we can combine different focus+context visualizations with different types of information visualization techniques. In the following, some examples will be given to illustrate this.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Examples</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Structured high-level computer program</head><p>Here, the data consists of a sequence of code that represents a computer program. One way to visualize and interact with a program would be to show it as a succession of lines, indented according to their place in the program structure, in which the user can scroll up and down. The program might also be represented as uniformly sized pages of text, which the user can switch between (this would reflect the way the program would look when printed on a laser printer and might be useful when making changes according to comments written on a print-out). We might also isolate the various components of the program, such as functions and data structures, and show these as nodes in a hierarchically ordered tree; this would represent the inherent hierarchical structure of the program.</p><p>On any of these visual representations, we can then apply a focus+context visualization technique. In the case of lines of indented text we might choose to use the Generalized Fisheye View <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. If we have text separated into uniformly-sized pages, we might use the Document Lens <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> or the Zoom Browser <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. If we choose to have the program represented as a set of hierarchically ordered objects and functions, we might want to use the Hyperbolic Tree Browser <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> or Cone Trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>Considering the interaction that might be possible in the system, users should of course be able to manipulate the data itself by making changes in the code; these changes will directly affect the data, and will be reflected in the first-order visualization as changes in the text, indentation, hierarchical structure, etc. But users can also manipulate the focus+context visualization by means of changing the focus, increasing or decreasing the degree of magnification, etc. These changes are occurring in the second-order visualization, and will not change the actual data, only the way it is shown to the user.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Geographical elevation data</head><p>When creating a geographical model of a certain area, the data can be described as a number of data triplets, with the two first values representing coordinates in the plane, and the third component representing the altitude. A common way to represent this type of data is to create a graphical map in two dimensions, where gray-scales or colors indicate the altitude. In some cases, however, it might be useful to use a table of the underlying numerical values, perhaps for working with the data in a spreadsheet application. Alternatively, we might create a fully 3-dimensional representation of the data, which could be rotated and viewed from different angles.</p><p>A 2-dimensional map is the most common representation used for this kind of data in focus+context visualization, as it is suited to for many distortion-based techniques, such as the Rubbersheet View <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and the Graphical Fisheye View <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. A very different, but still valid, type of focus+context view can be given of the tabular data with a technique such as the <ref type="table">Table Lens</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. In the case of a fully three-dimensional representation there may be a natural focus+context effect in the use of perspective: the parts that are close to the point of view will be more into focus than parts further away. However, for a more generalized focus+context view of 3dimensional data, methods such as those presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> might be used.</p><p>Considering the interactivity, if the map data is only to be viewed as-is, users might only interact with the information at the focus+context, i.e. second level of visualization, by changing the focus and magnification, etc. However, if the user is going to change the data in some way, say do some manual corrections to the survey values, this interaction will take place at the first level, and be directly reflected in the table, map or other underlying visual presentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">A FORMAL DESCRIPTION</head><p>We will now describe the focus+context visualization process in a more formal manner. The idea is to present the outline of a grammar of how a focus+context visualization can be described, rather than to describe how different processes are nestled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Visualizations</head><p>Any information visualization starts with a set of data, i.e. the information to visualize. A visual representation of this data setor some set of data derived or constructed from this set -can be constructed based on the values or inherent structures of this data. Let us define this information visualization as:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV ([D], V, I)</head><p>Here, IV is some form of information visualization in which [D] is the set of underlying data, V is how the data is presented visually, and I the interactivity or manipulation possible in the information visualization. For further details on the relation between data structures and their visualization, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</p><p>We must here distinguish between two different ways of manipulating IV. If I affects [D], we can use IV according to I to manipulate the underlying data set [D]. This would for instance correspond to making changes to the data in a spreadsheet or a word processor. A different mode of manipulation is when V is affected by I, i.e. when a user can manipulate IV in order to change the way [D] is presented. An example of this is the case with visual information searching through dynamic queries <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, where the user can customize the visualization to show certain aspects of the data, without making any changes to the underlying data set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Second-order Visualizations</head><p>If we instead of using [D] in the formula above insert some information visualization IV, or rather, a structure of visualizations, [IV], we will have a second-order visualization, IV':</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV' ([IV], V', I')</head><p>Here IV' is the new second-order visualization, [IV] is the underlying set of information visualizations, V' is the second-order visual component, and I' is the interaction or manipulation possible in this visualization. This formula will now enable us to import any information visualization set [IV], with its constraints V and I for how the structure can be visualized and changed, and apply any suitable new visualization and interaction method to this representation. Of course, in the same way as certain representations are only suited to certain types of data, [IV] may have to meet some constraints in order to fit into a certain second-order visualization IV'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Focus+Context Visualization</head><p>We will now describe focus+context visualization as an instance of a second-order visualization IV'. It will take any set of information visualizations [IV] as its input, given that [IV] is compatible with the focus+context visualization technique in question. We apply a visual presentation component V' and some interaction I' that reflects the focus+context method chosen. As we incorporate some underlying information visualization [IV] rather than some data set [D], we can focus on the aspects of V and I that are unique to focus+context techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Interaction</head><p>The most notable aspect of interaction in focus+context visualization is the ability to select a focus and have the presentation changed accordingly. A convention introduced in [9] is to call the point (or rather, object) in focus '.' (dot). Now, we can ask how other objects in the underlying visualization According to the same convention, this can be termed the Degree if Interest, DoI. In order to answer this, we have to describe the relation between '.' and x, or rather, the "distance" between '.' and x. The distance will depend on how closely the two objects are related to each other, but also of the individual properties of x. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> the function Level of Detail was used to establish a measure of this distance. The level of detail of an object x reflect where in a hierarchical structure it belongs; objects belonging to higher levels (i.e. more abstract) are said to have a lower level of detail, and hence they are more important when providing a general context. Let us use:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">W ( . , x)</formula><p>Where W is the weighted distance between '.' and x, or in other words the importance of x given '.' (where '.' and x ∈ [IV]).</p><p>However, there are other ways of controlling how closely related two objects are as well. We might for instance let the user link objects to each other, ensuring that whenever one of them is in focus, the other one will be brought forward as well. We might also allow for other ways of weighting the objects besides using their position in a hierarchy, making it possible for individual objects to have an independent "importance factor" associated with them. Furthermore, we might want to use a tool similar to the focal length on a camera, controlling how big the difference between the focus and context should be. At one extreme the use of such a tool would imply that nothing but '.' is seen, and at the other that there is no difference between '.' and the rest, i.e. a maximal and a minimal difference between '.' and the rest of [IV].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Visualization</head><p>Given that we know which object is in focus, and how important the other objects in [IV] are in relation to it, we can create a visual presentation. As the available resources are limited, some constraints have to be met. This makes it useful to introduce a threshold function, T. T depends on the size of the screen, s, its resolution, r, and the computational resources, c, available (at least if real-time interactivity should be possible). Hence we have:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T (s, r, c)</head><p>The threshold function T gives a value of how close an object will have to be to '.' in order to be visualized. In order to determine whether a certain object x should be visualized or not, the weighted distance W ( . , x) is compared with T: W ( . , x) &gt; T However, in some focus+context techniques objects are never excluded, meaning that T is not used to determine whether x should be visualized or not (or, alternatively, that W ( . , x) &gt; T for every '.' and x ∈ [IV]). W ( . , x) can also be used in order to determine which, if any, transformations of x's underlying visual presentation IV (which is presented according to V in the underlying representation) should be made, e.g. distortion or scaling. For example, x can be given an amount of space on the screen proportional to its distance to focus as defined by W( . , x) in which case V' can be a simple scaling of the image produced by V. W can also be used to determine where to display x in relation to '.', representing W with actual distance between objects on the screen.</p><p>Besides functions depending on '.' and W( . , x), transformations of the underlying representations and rules for screen layout can also be applied. For instance, structural aspects of [IV] can be used to determine where on the screen a certain object should be placed. If the objects in [IV] are ordered sequentially, say, as the pages in a book, we might want them to be ordered in the same way on the screen, whereas if [IV] is presented hierarchically, we would want the focus+context presentation to reflect this accordingly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">APPLYING THE FRAMEWORK</head><p>Having defined the formal framework, we can now use it to describe some of the examples presented earlier.</p><p>Considering the first example, the structured computer program, we have one set of data that is the code being edited, which we can term [D c ]. We can then choose to have some interactive representations of it: a line-based representation, or one based on discrete uniformly-sized pages of text, or one based on a hierarchically ordered set of components. Let us call them CV L (line-based code visualization), CV P (page-based), and CV H (hierarchical), respec-tively. Examining the components I and V of each representation, we see that the visual component V in the first case is a long sequence of lines of code, in the second it is a number of sequentially ordered pages of equal size, and in the third V is a number of differently sized chunks of code each representing a logical unit of some sort, presented in a tree structure. Similarly, in the first case I allows us to move up and down in the sequence of lines; in the second, it will allow us to switch back and forth between discrete pages of code; and in the third, it allows us to navigate the hierarchical structure of the program. If we term these components V L (line), V P (page) and V H (hierarchy), and I L , I P , and I H , respectively, we have the following formulas:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">CV L = IV ([D c ], V</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>L , I L ) (line-based visualization)</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CV P = IV ([D c ], V P , I P ) (page-based) CV H = IV ([D c ], V H , I H ) (hierarchical)</head><p>We can now insert these representations into a focus+context visualization. Common for all of these will be that the I component will allow the user to move the focal point, '.', in some way. In the Generalized Fisheye View, this will be through focusing on a single line; in the Document Lens and The Zoom Browser we can focus on a single page; and the in the Hyperbolic Tree and Cone Tree, we can move a certain point in the hierarchy into focus. These interactions, which we can term I L ' (line-based interaction), I P ' (page-based) I H ' (hierarchical), respectively, correspond directly to the interactive components of the first-order representation.</p><p>The visual component V' in the various cases has these properties: In the Generalized Fisheye View, only certain lines of code will be shown according to their degree-of-interest, with most detail being shown nearest to the focus; this we will term V L ' DoI (line-based degree-of-interest view). In the Document Lens the pages surrounding the focus will be distorted according to the combined perspective and optical metaphor used, but will keep their relative position. This we can call V P ' F (page-based focus+context view with fixed position). With the Zoom Browser, all surrounding pages will be shrunk to the same size, and rearranged sequentially according to the browser's left-to-right, topto-bottom convention; this we call V P ' S (page-based view with sequential position). Finally, in the Hyperbolic Tree Browser and Cone Trees, the act of focusing on one component will affect how the other components are shown according to their place in the hierarchy, so that components farther away in the hierarchy will be less visible, with close objects more visible. This we will call V H ' H (hierarchical view based on hyperbolic geometry) and V H ' 3D (hierarchical view based on 3D-perspective), respectively.</p><p>We can now describe any of the focus+context applications in this example in a formal way. For instance, the Generalized Fisheye view (let us call it GF) becomes:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GF = IV' ([CV L ], V L ' DoI , I L ')</head><p>In the same way, the Hyperbolic Tree (HT) used on our hierarchically ordered program becomes:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HT = IV' ([CV H ], V H ' H , I H ')</head><p>Using Cone Trees (CT) on the hierarchical ordering gives us a similar formula:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CT = IV' ([CV H ], V H ' 3D , I H ')</head><p>The other focus+context examples can be constructed according to the same principles.</p><p>We can also do some novel combinations. Say that we want to apply the Hyperbolic Tree view to a set of uniformly-sized sequential pages. Since the only structure we have access to is the discrete pages in sequential order, I P , we will have to base the interaction on this, but the visualization can still be done using hyperbolic geometry. Let us call this new Hyperbolic Tree variant HT:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HT P = IV' ([CV P ], V H ' H , I P ')</head><p>Since the visualization is designed to reflect a hierarchical structure, HT' might not be of much practical use, but the important point is that such novel applications can be constructed in this framework.</p><p>Similarly, returning to the map example, we may term the underlying geographical data </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RV Z = ([M Z ], V R , I R )</head><p>An interesting scenario would be to add some more complex interaction to the first-order representation, say a set of dynamic query sliders <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> to facilitate advanced visual data retrieval. We would then insert the interaction I DQ for the dynamic query searching, getting the resulting dynamic query-based map visualization M DQ . By applying a Rubbersheet view we would then get a focus+context application which included dynamic query searching of the map data:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RV DQ = ([M DQ ], V R , I D )</head><p>This might in fact be quite a useful application, since it will combine an advanced visual query method with the detail and overview supported by the Rubbersheet. Thus, the formal system has been shown to handle both existing focus+context applications, and novel combinations of first-and second-order visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">A SOFTWARE PACKAGE SUPPORTING THE MODEL</head><p>As we have seen, it is possible to generate different focus+context visualizations given the same underlying representation, or to apply the same focus+context visualization to a number of different representations, by varying the parameters described in the theoretical framework. This property of the formal description makes it suitable for implementation as a general software platform. We have constructed such a software package, to support the creation of focus+context visualizations of information visualizations consisting of sequentially ordered discrete visual objects. The reason for this choice of underlying visualization is that the package grew out of our work with flip zooming <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, which was developed specifically for this type of visualizations. However, the implementation of a general software package has allowed us to implement some quite novel variations of the original flip zoom concepts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">A Discrete Focus + Context Software Package</head><p>The package was constructed using the Java Abstract Window Toolkit <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. It is based on two types of Java classes: f+c (focus+context) components and f+c containers, corresponding to IV and IV' respectively. An f+c component is based on a standard Java window component, with the added functionality needed to interface with a focus+context visualization. In terms of the formal description presented above, components must provide ways to facilitate event handling related to the interaction I' given by a higher-order visualization IV'. The V and I portions of the components provide the painting of the component on the screen, and the handling of input from keyboard and mouse, for instance to facilitate manipulation of the underlying data set [D].</p><p>The f+c components are stored within f+c containers, in the same way as [IV] is used in IV'. An f+c container is a Java subclass of the f+c component class, meaning that it inherits the properties of the component and must facilitate the same functionality. An advantage of this is that it is possible to insert an f+c container into another f+c container, making higher-order visualizations possible. Further functionality is needed in order to support the focus+context visualization; most notably, the containers interaction portion I' has to allow for sequential transversal and the random access of focus objects.</p><p>The visualization V' consists of two parts: The f+c layout manager and the f+c visualizer. The layout manager, which handles how the components are placed on the screen area, can be implemented according to a number of different strategies, giving rise to a number of different presentation styles. It determines the size and position of the components and provides methods for how to change the layout when setting, changing and losing focus, or when objects in [IV] are inserted or removed during execution. The actual drawing of the components is done by the f+c visual-izer, which has access to the different visualization functions V in the underlying visualizations in [IV].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Examples of different implementations</head><p>We have used the software framework to implement a number of sample applications. In the following, we will briefly describe some of these, focusing on how IV and IV' are related to each other. (More details on the applications can be found in the references.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1">The Hierarchical Image Browser</head><p>The Hierarchical Image Browser <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> was designed to explore the possibilities of using hierarchies to present large image sets in a structured way (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1)</ref>. The hierarchies might for instance reflect the way art is exhibited in a museum, i.e. being placed in different rooms, sections and floors according to the types of paintings. The images in the set [IV] were ordered into containers IV' according to their placement in the hierarchy. Further, these containers were ordered in higher level containers IV'', IV''', etc., according to the hierarchical structure. This application shows how the general software framework allowed us to insert focus+context visualizations into higher-order focus+context visualizations, thus reflecting the general nature of the theoretical framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2">The Digital Variants Browser</head><p>Developed as an aid to literature researchers, the Digital Variants application <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> presented several versions of one text to facilitate comparative studies (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2)</ref>. The application accommodated a number of document variants IV, each of which was presented in a focus+context display IV'. This set of focus+context visualizations [IV'] was then visualized in a third-order focus+context visualization IV'' of slightly different sort, namely one that allowed for two simultaneous foci, facilitating the comparison of two texts. This application shows how we could use the software framework to create second-and third-order focus+context visualizations with slightly different interactive and visual properties. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.3">The WEST Browser</head><p>The WEST browser, a WEb browser for Small Terminals <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, was developed for use on small mobile devices, such as Personal Digital Assistants (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3 &amp; 4)</ref>. Due to the limitations in display area (160 x 160 pixels) and computational power, both the space factor s and the computational factor c, put constraints on the visualization. To solve these problems, webpages were pre-processed in a number of steps to create a suitable structure [IV]. First, a web page was stripped of banners and divided into a number of small chunks, cards, each which would fit into the allowed screen space. The cards were then ordered in a hierarchical structure with no more than seven children to any node. All images in the original web page were scaled to the appropriate size and saved in the representation [IV]. Further, each of the cards was analyzed in order to find links and keywords. These were used as complementary structures of the webpage in [IV]. Thus, the pre-processing delivered three sets of [IV]: one based on the graphical look of the cards, one based on the extracted keywords and one based on the links.</p><p>The interface I' of the WEST browser facilitated navigation between the different levels of cards representing one webpage, but also the traditional functionality I associated with a web browser, such as the ability to follow links and use a history list. The user could also switch between three views: normal webpage, keyword view and link view, thus visualizing different components of [IV] in the same higher-order visualization IV'. This application shows how the framework allowed us to construct a complex interactive visualization of several different underlying visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper, we first presented arguments for separating focus+context visualizations into first-and second-order visualizations, supported by some intuitive examples. We then presented a formal framework for describing properties of such aggregated visualizations and the relations between them. This enabled us to describe our initial examples in a formal way, thus validating the formal framework. We showed that the framework allowed us to  construct some novel combinations of first-and second-order information visualizations. We also described some work with a general software package based on the formal framework, including example applications that uses hierarchies of focus+context visualizations and multiple underlying visualizations.</p><p>We can now see that according to our formal description, any IV that fulfils the constraints posed by IV' can be incorporated into the set [IV]. This means that we can incorporate any information visualization IV into any higher-order visualization IV'. This opens a lot of interesting possibilities: there is for instance nothing to stop us from applying several focus+context visualizations IV, IV', IV'', etc. to each other. As we saw with the hierarchical image browser and the Digital Variants browser, this can in fact be a very useful technique for combining different types of views or building a hierarchical visualization.</p><p>In the software package, we also have the possibility of using different types of applications within a f+c container as long as they fulfil the specified criteria for being a f+c component. One example of such an application is the Focus+Context Desktop (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4)</ref>, which incorporates any application displayed in a Java window, including web browsers, web-cameras, file directory browsers and telnet clients, into a common workspace based on focus+context visualization (similar systems include <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>). Future work should include evaluating such systems, as well as further experiments with nested focus+context visualizations, and applications that have heterogeneous types of underlying visualizations</p><p>The framework given in this article is not limited to focus+context visualizations, and it should be possible to use it to describe and construct many other types of interesting higher-order visualizations. Similarly, it should be possible to construct a software framework that supports other types of visualizations apart from focus+context techniques. (As we have seen, the Java language is quite suitable for the construction of such software.) However, we need to better understand the properties of the visualization components, (V, V', etc.) and the interaction components (I, I', etc). In particular, if we could isolate the necessary properties required for a certain higher-order visual component V' and interactive component I' to be compatible with the lower-order V and I, we will be able to state more clearly whether a certain combination of visual-izations is likely to be practically useful or not. For instance, in the example section, we gave only an intuitive motivation for why Hyperbolic Trees might not be well suited to visualizing sequential data; if such relations could be expressed more formally, the usefulness of the framework should be increased quite significantly.</p><p>If extended in such a way, the framework might allow us to better explore the properties of novel visualizations even before they are implemented. It might provide answers to questions such as: What focus+context visualizations are best suited to a specific underlying visualization? How can different visualizations be combined in a focus+context visualization? How does the interactivity of a underlying visualization affect a focus+context visualization and vice versa? Our hope is that by making the distinction between different levels of visualization explicit, and by introducing a formal system that supports this notion, new possibilities within the design space of both focus+context techniques and information visualization in general will become available. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>[IV] are related to '.': given a '.' ∈ [IV], how important is another object x ∈ [IV]?</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>[G]. If we choose to represent it as a static 2-dimensional map, M, we may have a visual component V M2D (2-dimensional map) but no interaction component (resulting in I being empty). We can then apply, say, a Rubbersheet View to this map, with the visual component being that of rubbersheet deformation, V R , and the interactive component being that of rubbersheet interaction, I R . The Rubbersheet View (RV) visualization of a static map would then be: RV = ([M], V R , I R ) Where M = ([G], V M , I), and I is empty. However, we might want to have an interactive rather than a static map as first-order representation of [G]. For instance, if we want to have a zoomable map, being able to zoom in on certain parts for further visualization in the Rubbersheet view, we may have M Z = ([G], V M , I Z ), if I Z is the zooming interaction and M Z is the resulting zooming representation of the map. This can then be inserted in the Rubbersheet view, resulting in a new variant:</figDesc></figure>
