				<p>Domain Analysis for Data Visualization (DADV) is a technique to use when investigating a domain where data visualizations are going to be designed and added to existing software systems. DADV was used to design the data visualization in VisEIO-LCA, which is a framework to visualize environmental data about products. Most of the visualizations are designed using the following stages: formatting data in tables, selecting visual structures, and rendering the data on the screen. Although many visualizations authors perform implicit domain analysis, in this paper, domain analysis is added explicitly to the process of designing visualizations with the goal of producing more usable software tools. Environmental Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used as a test bed for this technique.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The research on information visualization has been focused on graphic techniques as well as interaction techniques. Progress has been made by many groups in the following areas:</p><p>• Visualization of Multidimensional Data <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>; • Automatic Design <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>; • Interactive Techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>; • Focus and Context <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>;</p><p>• Tree and Network Visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>; and • Visualization Frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>; etc.</p><p>Currently some research groups are working on the visualization of documents and information on the internet.</p><p>In this paper, the focus is on developing data visualizations based on user tasks. It is our hypothesis that the study of a user's tasks should yield usable information for visualization design. The knowledge of tasks and user models can help to select the data structures, the visualization techniques to use, as well as the interaction techniques.</p><p>The traditional design process starts with the data tables as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. In this traditional design process, designers select the data visualization techniques used in their systems based only on the type of information to visualize <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Other researchers design visualizations based on low level tasks such as search, lookup, verify, and computation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Although most of the research papers do not include a domain analisis explicitly, the analysis has been performed for some of the visualizations designers. The explicit addition of a new step, domain analysis, to the traditional design process allows for a better fit of the data visualizations to the user tasks. During domain analysis, the knowledge of users and tasks are gathered and structured to be used in the selection of visualization and interaction techniques. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the recommended process for designing data visualizations. Explicit domain analysis is useful as a document that allows designers to evaluate effectiveness of visualizations based on the users requirements and needs. Also, explicit domain analysis is useful to store the knowledge about the <ref type="table">Tables  Technique  Selection  Rendering   Tables  Technique  Selection  Rendering</ref> Domain Analysis design process that may make it possible to reuse old visual designs. The modification of this process requires a systematic method to gather knowledge about tasks and domains as well as heuristics to guide the process of selection of graphical and interaction techniques.</p><p>To achieve these tasks, a method to perform domain analysis is described in this paper. Also described is a set of heuristics to select the graphic techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. Domain Analysis</head><p>Domain Analysis for Data Visualization (DADV) produces a structured description of the domain, a group of user tasks, and a list of visualization needs.</p><p>Domain analysis is an exploratory activity to gather knowledge about a specific domain. It is similar to the activity of knowledge acquisition used by knowledge engineers who gather knowledge when developing expert systems. Domain analysis practitioners gather knowledge about of the data and problem solving processes of a domain.</p><p>The methods used to gather knowledge about a specific domain are expert interviews, reviews of literature about the domain, observation of users performing tasks, and problem solving in the studied domain.</p><p>The output from domain analysis is the domain description, the description of the user tasks, and the list of visualization needs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Domain Description.</head><p>The domain description includes only the objects related to the solution of problems:</p><p>• Entities. The entities are used to describe the phenomena in the model. These entities consist of a set of attributes that describe the objects in the world. • Relationships between entities. The relationships could be mathematical or causal. • Assumptions. The assumptions in the data model are needed to understand the limitations. • Data sources. These data sources are the data used in the domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. User Tasks</head><p>The list of user tasks is ranked by frequency. The task description includes:</p><p>• the user tasks when he/she solves a problem;</p><p>• the stages followed to solve a problem, which are needed to understand the whole process of data analysis and information processing; and • the data analysis heuristics followed by the users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Visualization User Needs</head><p>Users are interviewed about their visualization needs. Users suggest the types of displays that may make solving the problem easier. The visualization needs consists of:</p><p>• heuristics to perform the data analysis; • graphic techniques suggested; and • the level of detail needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. Domain Analysis: A Case Study</head><p>The domain analysis method was used in the analysis of the Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) domain, which is a data intensive domain.</p><p>An existing software prototype to practice LCA was used as a starting point in this domain study. A group of LCA users provided the knowledge needed to design a visualization tool that supports their tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Domain Description</head><p>Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a tool used by environmental scientists to evaluate the environmental impacts of a product or service during its entire life-cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>The reason to evaluate the entire life-cycle of a product is that environmental emissions might occur during any lifecycle period, such as manufacturing, material extraction, or end-of-life.</p><p>A life-cycle study is divided into the following stages: inventory analysis, impact analysis, and improvement analysis. In the inventory analysis step, the materials, energy, and emissions during the entire life are computed. The impact analysis consists of assessing the effects of emissions and discharges during the inventory step. Finally, the improvement analysis step looks for opportunities to minimize emissions, material usage, and environmental discharges <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Economic Input-Output Life-Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) is a specific method used to perform LCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> based on the economic method named input-output <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. This method receives a change in the demand, in millions of dollars, for particular industrial sectors as inputs and it computes the environmental effects due to these changes for the entire supply chain. The data used in this method are publicly available. The economic data used is the commodity by commodity matrix that reflects the economic information for a particular country. The toxic release inventory (TRI) for the same year as that of the economic data, and other environmental vectors, such as energy, fuels, and ores consumed by every industrial sector, are components of the EIO-LCA data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Entities</head><p>The entities considered in an EIO-LCA study are industrial sectors, materials, environmental discharges, changes in the demand, and LCA stages.</p><p>• Industrial Sectors. The economy of an area is divided in industrial sectors. Those sectors interact by exchanging goods. A matrix describes the interaction between sectors, where the coefficients characterize the exchange between the sectors. A column represents the inputs to the sector while the outputs of sectors are represented by a row. • Materials. The materials used to produce a product or to offer a service are included in this category. The most important materials to evaluate are non-renewable resources. Those materials are never accounted for in the social cost of a product. • Environmental Discharges. These discharges are the toxic chemicals released into the environment. These discharges are accounted for based on the media into which they are released. The media reported by the companies include air, water, land, and underground. • Changes in the Demand. These changes are purchases or sales in one or more economic sectors, used to assess proposed designs. • LCA Stages. These stages are the components for the life of a product. The stages considered are materials extraction, manufacturing, use, and end-of-life. An EIO-LCA evaluation could address of one or more of these stages of a product life-cycle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationships</head><p>The relationships between entities are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  3</ref>. The entities represented by rectangles are sectors that interact by buying or selling products or goods to other sectors. Relationships are represented using diamonds, which join the entities. Arrows represent inputs and outputs to each sector. Every industrial sector uses materials, fuels and energy. The same sectors send environmental discharges to the environment. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assumptions</head><p>The major assumptions made for EIO-LCA users are described below.</p><p>• The environmental effects are proportional to the economic effects. A sector with more change in the economy will have more emissions than a sector with a lower economical change. • The product or service evaluated is considered as an average product. For example, when a car is evaluated, the system considers a generic car without distinction in the architecture, prices, and any other differences.</p><p>• The economic data remains constant over 5 years. The Department of Commerce updates this data every five years. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Sources</head><p>The data sources are publicly available. The data are provided electronically and are explained below.</p><p>• Six digit commodity-by-commodity economic matrix.</p><p>This table is a component of the 1992 Benchmark Input-Output Accounts. This document is produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the US Department of Commerce <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. • Toxic Release Inventory. This database is provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The most recent published data is for 1995. This database only contains data from manufacturing industries and consists of more than 600 chemicals sent to different media <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. • Data about energy, fuels, ores, conventional pollutants, hazardous waste, and water were obtained from different sources such as the EPA and the Census Bureau. The data was integrated by industrial sector and the units used are metric tons by million of dollars. The data analysis components were obtained after interviewing users performing EIO-LCA evaluations. The ten users that were interviewed belong to the same research group, but they have different degrees of expertise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. User Tasks</head><p>The study of user tasks was performed by interviewing EIO-LCA users. EIO-LCA users were asked to describe the way they define the problems and the way they perform the data analysis.</p><p>Other tasks, which are not included in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, were studied by interacting every day with the LCA research team.</p><p>The tasks could be divided in the following groups: tasks for LCA practitioners and tasks for LCA researchers.</p><p>As can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, the task performed with more frequency by EIO-LCA practitioners was the comparison of alternative designs, policies, or processes. The users try to find answers to questions such as "which design, process or policy is more environmentally friendly."  The second most common user task is the LCA of a product, which is a subtask of a product comparison.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sales</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EIO-LCA Practitioners Tasks</head><p>These tasks were gathered from user interviews. Ten EIO-LCA users were interviewed to have a clear understanding of how EIO-LCA is used. The tasks performed by EIO-LCA users are product comparisons and EIO-LCA evaluations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Product Comparison</head><p>Frequently, EIO-LCA users wants to compare many alternative designs or many products. The comparison is performed based on environmental impacts. For example, two car models built with different materials can be compared based on environmental impacts through their entire life-cycle. In the same way, the environmental impacts produced by the changes in some industrial sectors could be compared. In the case of comparisons, an EIO-LCA evaluation must be performed for every product or design compared.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EIO-LCA Evaluation</head><p>An EIO-LCA evaluation is a subtask of a product comparison. An EIO-LCA evaluation estimates the environmental impacts of a product through its life-cycle. Many times, an EIO-LCA evaluation is practiced for every product life-cycle stage. For example, one EIO-LCA for manufacturing, and one EIO-LCA for recycling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tasks for EIO-LCA Researchers</head><p>The EIO-LCA researchers perform the same tasks as the EIO-LCA practitioners, but they perform additional tasks. Two of those tasks are described in the following paragraphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Benchmarks</head><p>Advanced users are aware that EIO-LCA is still a research prototype. As such, they perform validations of particular data sets. For example, if they were to receive the general statistics of electricity for the entire US, then they would want to compare the data with the information used by EIO-LCA to perform the computations. The validation and comparison of data sets is performed also with conventional pollutants and global warming potential. Other times, they might want to compare the environmental effects of performing an LCA with data from two different years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Navigation</head><p>Some users want to investigate specific data values in the economic matrix or the environmental vectors when they do not agree with the EIO-LCA results. However, many times they need also to see the Make <ref type="table">Table, and the Use Table,</ref> which are other economic matrices used to compute the commodity-by-commodity matrix included in the software. It is difficult to navigate over the complete information because these matrices are very large and they do not fit on the screen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Visualization User Needs</head><p>The heuristics of analysis as well as the visualization technique suggestions, were obtained from user interviews.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Heuristics to perform the data analysis</head><p>Data analysis strategies are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. The first column represents the name of the data set to be analyzed. Every column from the second to the tenth represents a user. The numbers represent the priority assigned for the users to review the data. While 1 represents the maximum priority, 7 represents the lower priority.</p><p>As can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, the average user assigned 1 to the economic data and 2 to the electricity data. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows that no user assigned a priority to every vector in the data analysis process. Users did not seem to assign priorities to the data about ores and fertilizers. Global warming potential, ozone depletion, and water data did not receive a priority from many users. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> suggests that users only reviewed a short portion of the data displayed in the results and they had different criteria to prioritize which data to review in the process of analysis. There is a possibility that every user had a different degree of confidence about the data. Some users seemed to have more confidence in TRI data, while others might had more confidence in other data sets. The users interviewed suggested the visualization representations that they would like to use to represent the EIO-LCA results. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> presents the suggestions given by the users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visualization techniques suggested</head><p>As can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>, more users preferred the presentation of ranks including percentages. Some users wanted to see several products in the same graphic display when they were doing comparisons. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Level of detail needed</head><p>To evaluate the level of detail that users need when they perform a data analysis, a question concerning this issue was posed during the interview. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> shows the EIO-LCA users opinions. The data is presented in two columns: names of the detail required and the data frequency required. As can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>, users preferred summaries and ranks of data instead of detailed information. Detailed infor-mation seemed to be necessary only when a user had a very specific question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. VisEIO-LCA Design</head><p>Without doing the domain analysis, the starting point to select the interaction and visualization techniques would be the data tables. However, the selection of visualization techniques can be improved by using the knowledge about the domain.</p><p>The design of VisEIO-LCA was directed by the following user tasks: product comparisons and data navigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Product Comparisons</head><p>This task is performed by LCA practitioners using a matrix with 485 rows representing the industrial sectors and 51 columns representing the environmental vectors.</p><p>To perform a comparison of several products, a user works with one matrix for each product.</p><p>When designing a data visualization for this task, it is not necessary to display the whole matrix on the screen, because users do not want to see the complete matrix. The users select subsets of the matrix to visualize as can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>The EIO-LCA users do not need the whole environmental vector (a column in the EIO results matrix). They usually see only the summaries (only totals are included in summaries) or the top five or ten elements in each vector.</p><p>To perform perceptual comparisons, the best graphical property is length. For a human, it is more difficult to compare two objects based on color, shape, or orientation. However, when the objects are represented using length the perceptual comparison is easier when the objects are shown together. Chart styles, such as bars, lines, areas, and steps, can be used to encode the data to be compared.</p><p>The data used in a comparison can be represented as a chain of sectors. This chain has several products at the root level. Every product has several environmental vector families. Every family contains several environmental vectors. The data navigation might be done using the hierarchy. Because trees are good to represent hierarchies, they could be used to represent the data used in the comparison.</p><p>Based on the previous information, the following techniques were selected: trees to group the information of products as a hierarchy (view trees), and charts to represent the product data. The workbook metaphor is used to allow users to have different graphics for the same comparison.</p><p>Only 2D graphics were selected because the task does not require more sophisticated techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Data Navigation</head><p>Advanced EIO-LCA users want to navigate the data sets. For this goal, there is no information about how the users would like to see the data displayed. There are 3 economic matrices used as data sources in EIO-LCA. Those matrices are the make matrix, the use matrix, and the commodity-by-commodity matrix.</p><p>The selection of interaction techniques and the graphic techniques was made for every type of data source.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Matrix Visualization</head><p>The complete matrix is presented on the screen. The matrix to display can be selected from a tree that contains every data set in the system as can be seen in Color Plate 1.</p><p>The whole matrix is rendered on the screen. Color is used to represent the values in the matrix. The range of values is divided into categories and then a color is assigned to each category. A user can interactively change the color map and the limit values for each category. Also, a user can select only subsets to view or a specific point in the matrix to see in another window in more detail. Color Plate 1 shows the matrix visualization. In addition, a bar chart can be displayed for every row and column in the matrix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental Vectors Visualization</head><p>There are 51 environmental vectors that can be visualized in the system. Every vector is displayed completely on the screen. Color was used to represent each value. The values are divided into categories and then the user can assign a color to each category. The limits between categories can be changed by the users as well as the color map.</p><p>Detail about the vector can be seen in another window, which magnifies specific vector areas as can be seen in Color Plate 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. VisEIO-LCA Architecture</head><p>The architecture of VisEIO-LCA has the following modules as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>:</p><p>• Chart Visualization. This component allows the user to select a level of detail for the information. A user also can select the number of sectors to visualize. One or more products might be displayed on one screen. • Scatter Plot Visualization. This component displays the data in detail. This view allows the user to see the whole environmental vector on the screen while the chart view only allows users to see a partial picture of the system. • Data Visualization. This component allows the user to see the data matrices in detail. The user can investigate specific values as well as look for patterns in the data sets. • Geographic View. This component allows the user to see the environmental impacts by geographic area. A user can see which areas are impacted by changing the final demand value and the environmental vector.</p><p>The EIO-LCA module generates the data sets used by the visualization modules. Currently, there are three different ways to see the EIO-LCA results and only one way to view the data sets. The only communication between modules is based on the system data inputs or the data results.</p><p>Module details are explained in the following paragraphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Chart Visualization</head><p>The following information with respect to the use of the chart view was obtained from interviews of experienced users:</p><p>• The most performed task is the life-cycle comparison of designs or products. • The LCA evaluation of a product is the second most frequent task. • Users do not view the whole data set to make their decisions. • LCA practitioners want to see data summaries.</p><p>• Users like to view the information ranked by specific values. They are only interested in the top five or ten commodities in the list. • The data subsets selected to perform the analysis differ from one person to another.</p><p>Based on the information obtained from users, the following data visualization design decisions were made:</p><p>• The use of charts was selected because users want to see summaries. • The styles of charts that were selected were those that use bars, steps, lines and areas. They were selected because the use of length as a graphic property is more effective for performing comparisons of numerical data. • A user can display several products at the same time using a particular chart style. • The product information can be compared with the national values. For example, the comparison of energy required for one product and the the energy consumed in the whole country.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Scatter Plot Visualization</head><p>This view was provided although users do not seem to look for details. However, it was considered important because sometimes they might require details on demand.</p><p>This view presents the complete set of points for one environmental vector over the entire set of sectors. The horizontal axis contains the 485 industrial sectors and the vertical axis</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EIO-LCA</head></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chart Visualization</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Geographic Visualization</head><p>contains the values for the environmental vector as can be seen in Color Plate 3. The following functions are provided with this data view:</p><p>• Change the range of values. This function allows users to select a subset of the data set. For example, a user wants to see the sectors that produce air emissions between value 1 and value2. • View different data vectors in the same scatter plot. This allows the comparison of two environmental vectors. • View the detail for an specific point selected. For example the name of the sector and the exact value for the specific point. The detail is presented in a different window. A user can have up to 10 vectors at the same time in one scatter plot as can be seen in Color Plate 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Data Visualization</head><p>This module was created because advanced EIO-LCA researchers sometimes want to verify or compare the data in the system. The tasks that users want to achieve with data are the following:</p><p>• Compare a data vector with a vector obtained from other information sources. This operation is called data benchmarking in this document. • Navigate through the economic matrices and environmental vectors. This function is needed when users are trying to explain some results obtained from one EIO-LCA evaluation.</p><p>To support data benchmarking, the visualization of vectors was selected. The vectors are displayed using color to represent values.</p><p>A family of vectors is displayed in one workbook page. A user can change the color maps and the ranges to visualize the data. The user can see in detail specific sectors in the detail window.</p><p>The matrices are encoded by color. The commodity-bycommodity matrix, the make matrix, and the use matrix can be navigated by users. A user can see the names and values for specific points in the matrix by using the detail window that magnify specific areas on the screen. A user can also display the values for an specific sector in a row or column as can be seen in Color Plate 1.</p><p>Users can magnify the matrix cells in the detail window. For example, they can show the values for the interaction between sector 1 and sector 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Geographic Visualization</head><p>The geographic view was not suggested by the EIO-LCA practitioners, but was by some advanced EIO-LCA researchers. This component allows users to see the graphic locations affected by the environmental impacts.</p><p>A user can select an economic sector and a vector to visualize on the map. For example, a user can select primary batteries as the sector and air releases as the environmental vector. A user also can select all sectors and an environmental vector to visualize on the map where the affected areas are located. For example, a user selects air releases for the whole group of economical sectors.</p><p>Users can zoom in on the map or they can get the information about specific states. Color Plate 4 shows the graphic view of the data set.</p><p>This geographic data of EIO-LCA evaluations can be only seen by using graphic tools and is difficult to visualize using tables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. Implementation</head><p>VisEIO-LCA supports four different views that include the chart view, the scatter plot view, the data view, and the geographic view.</p><p>The graphic interface for the software prototype is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>.</p><p>The information is presented to users using the following three windows: the Project Window, the Workspace Window, and the Detail Window.</p><p>The Project Window that is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> to the left of window that displays the chart includes the data sets that a user can visualize and includes three tabs that are useful to select the data views. The first tab allows users to display charts, the second tab allows users to display the data sets used for the EIO-LCA software to make the computations, and the third tab that allows users to view the data using scatter plots.</p><p>The Workspace Window is the where the graphics are displayed. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>, The Workspace Window presents a bar chart. This window can be composed of many pages that compose a workbook with visualizations about the task performed in the project.</p><p>Finally, the Detail Window, that is to the left of the CMU logo in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>, allows users to see detailed information for the data and scatter views. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. Summary and Future Research</head><p>Explicit domain analysis helps to direct the process of designing a software system that provides data visualization. The design of visualization tools based on user tasks should produce more usable tools.</p><p>Explicit domain analysis was useful for designing and implementing the visual EIO-LCA software. The advantage of using explicit domain analysis is that provides documentation about the user requirements, user tasks, and the process used to design the visualizations. This documentation can also be used to evaluate effectiveness of the visualization.</p><p>Other engineering domains are being investigated so as to obtain a more robust and generic tool appliable to other domains.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Traditional Visualization Design Process</figDesc></figure>
