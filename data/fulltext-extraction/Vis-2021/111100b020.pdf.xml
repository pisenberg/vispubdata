<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Visualizations take advantage of people's perception to facilitate intuitively understanding data. Interactive features of visualizations become critical when considering complex data, allowing people to progres- sively refine visual representations of data. While it can aid in comprehension of large and complex data, certain patterns of interactivity can signal insular data analysis practices. Users may be unknowingly stuck inside an "echo chamber", where their own unconscious biases may lead them to attend to certain parts of the data while neglecting others.</p><p>Unconscious biases can take many forms, some of which are relatively innocuous (i.e., personal preference for a particular genre of movie) while others can lead to costly incorrect decisions or engender harmful societal stereotypes. For instance, dark-skinned people are denied parole (racial bias) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, women experience a variety of barriers to equity in C-suite promotions (gender bias) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, ailing but younger people are denied optimal treatment (age bias) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, etc. Even when these factors are not actively considered, they can implicitly affect the way people examine and process new information <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and hence their analytic behaviors.</p><p>Apart from implicit biases and stereotypes, there are other cognitive and perceptual biases that also influence people's analytic behaviors. Cognitive biases, in particular, describe systematic errors that can result from the use of "fast and frugal" heuristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> to make decisions. Several biases have been shown to extend to tasks involving visualizations for decision making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>). Yet, common visual data analysis tools such as Tableau and Microsoft Excel that help users see and understand their data do not report analytic behaviors that may correspond to such biases. Therefore we ask: how much can understanding data analysis and decision-making behaviors reduce the potentially negative influences of potential cognitive, perceptual, or societal biases, if users were simply more aware of these often unconscious factors?</p><p>We present Lumos, an analysis tool that visualizes interaction history with data (i.e., interaction traces <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>) to increase awareness of potential interaction biases that influence data analysis and decision making processes. Using in-situ and ex-situ visualization techniques, Lumos provides real-time feedback about a user's analytic behavior for self-awareness and self-reflection to potentially change future course. For example, Lumos remembers and highlights datapoints that have been previously examined in the same visualization (in-situ) and overlays the interacted datapoints on the underlying data distribution in a separate visualization (ex-situ) for comparison. Furthermore, Lumos allows users to configure a custom target distribution to reflect decision making goals (e.g., a university admissions committee in a computer science department may define an analysis target of 60% female to promote increased gender diversity in the department, even if only 40% of applicants are female). We posit that Lumos can improve behaviors exhibited during data exploration and decision-making to help mitigate the dangers of human interaction biases affecting judgments and foster more transparent analysis processes.</p><p>The primary contributions of this work include (1) a technique to model users' analytic behavior from interactions with the data, (2) a visual analysis tool, Lumos (https://lumos-vis.github.io/), that implements visualizing analytic behavior using interaction traces, (3) a series of scenarios that describe potential usage of Lumos, and (4) results from a user study to understand how Lumos helps users be more aware of their analytic behavior during visual data analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Graphical History</head><p>We are limited by our memory's capacity to remember and track our prior interactions with data in both amount and decay <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> which creates a barrier to data exploration. Analyzing prior interactions with data in a visualization is one form of analytic provenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref> often used to infer about one's analysis process (beyond analytic outcomes). Visualizing one's prior interactions can take many forms and lead to shifts in a user's analysis behavior. For instance, when users' prior interactions with charts or data points are encoded (e.g., analogous to coloring previously visited hyperlinks on a webpage purple), people tend to interact with more of the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Similarly, when exploration history is shown in interactive network visualizations, users report inspiration for conducting further analysis and greater recall of their prior explorations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Cleverly designed histories can also help users maintain contextual awareness of previously visited data when distortions are applied that would otherwise make contextual awareness a challenge (e.g., fisheye lens) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. More generally, Heer et al. summarize a design space of mechanisms for displaying interaction histories <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Given ongoing recognition within the visualization community that interaction histories can serve a wide range of purposes, recent tooling has been developed to support provenance tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Graphical traces of user interactions have also been utilized in collaborative visualization settings, e.g., to facilitate coordination of multiple users by showing current selections and interactions as "coverage" of the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> and in personalized integrated development environments (IDEs), e.g., Footsteps for VSCode 1 highlights the lines of code as they are edited by the user. Similarly, showing social information "scents" on data visualization widgets (e.g., representing others' interactions with radio buttons, sliders, etc.) leads users to make substantially more unique discoveries in the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Outside of the visualization domain, traces of prior interactions have long been applied in HCI contexts, including revisiting common regions of a page using scrollbar history <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, tracking interactions with documents by authors and readers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, facilitating groupware coordination <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, tracking user focus while browsing a webpage using eye-tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and mouse-tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> gear, etc. We take inspiration from this lineage of graphical representations of interaction history in our technique, interaction traces, expanded from <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and described further in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Modeling User Behavior</head><p>Several metrics have been proposed in data visualization to characterize behaviors during data analysis with visualizations. For instance, Feng, Peck, and Harrison propose metrics to quantify exploration uniqueness and exploration pacing as users interact with points in a scatterplot <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Ottley, Garnett, and Wan use a hidden Markov model to capture user attention to predict clicks in a visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Perhaps most relevant to the present work, Gotz, Sun, and Cao model and visualize the provenance of how a user's subset selections of the data differ from the dataset as a whole <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. We similarly model and visualize deviations of user behavior against a baseline; however, rather than focusing on explicit subset selections, we utilize a breadth of user interactions (including clicks, hovers, visualization configurations, filter configurations, etc.) as signals in our analytic behavior model.</p><p>Zhou et al. introduce a formal model of focus based on user interactions defined by (1) type of action and (2) focus of the action in the form of an additive model <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Wall et al. define metrics for quantifying bias, similarly based on (1) type of interaction and (2) object of interaction; however, these metrics differ in that they compare the observed focus to a baseline of "unbiased" behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. While these metrics have been used to quantify bias (e.g., anchoring), they are also more generally used to capture deviations from uniform behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. Because it compares user behavior to a flexibly defined baseline, in this work we utilize the metrics by Wall et al. to model user behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">LUMOS</head><p>In this section we first define the terminologies used in the paper, enumerate our design goals, and describe the Lumos user interface. Interaction Logs. Telemetry data of a user's interactions (e.g., hovers) with the user interface elements (e.g., datapoints on a scatterplot). Analytic Behavior Model. A model that quantifies user's behavior (set of actions) from interaction logs (e.g., computing the distribution of interacted datapoints and attributes). Interaction Traces. Visual feedback of the user's analytic behavior in the user interface; this is shown by adding visual scents in two ways: in-situ (at the place of interaction) and ex-situ (in an external view).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Awareness.</head><p>Knowing what is going on <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> or what has been done and found during the exploration process to perform effective reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>; in this context, knowledge gained from inspecting one's analytic behavior via interaction traces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Design Goals</head><p>Our development of Lumos was driven by five key design goals. We compiled these goals based on a combination of similar prior visual analysis tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>, formative feedback from pilot studies, and our own hypotheses with respect to usability. DG1. Capture and present analytic behavior with attributes. Overemphasis (or underemphasis) on specific attributes during data exploration may lead to unconscious biases (e.g., not interacting with a Gender attribute may practically result in a bias towards men if the dataset has more men than women). This goal translates to capturing user interactions with attributes, modeling analytic behavior, and showing interaction traces to increase awareness to influence changes in subsequent interactions. DG2. Capture and present analytic behavior with datapoints. Overemphasis (or underemphasis) can also occur on specific values of data (e.g., interacting mostly with a few top candidates for university admissions may come at the expense of neglecting other candidates). This translates to the same goal as DG1 but at the datapoint-level. DG3. Facilitate configuring different target distributions. Determining overemphasis (or underemphasis) on specific attributes or data requires comparing a user's analytic behavior with a known target distribution (e.g., the underlying data) as a baseline. However, different domains, tasks, attributes, or social norms may call for different target distributions. This goal translates to allowing users to configure different target distributions to suit their requirements. DG4. Facilitate comparison between analytic behavior and a baseline distribution. This goal translates to visualizing the user's analytic behavior and the configured target distribution and quantifying the difference (or similarity) between the two distributions. DG5. Facilitate visual data exploration while showing awareness. This goal ensures that visual data exploration usability is not sacrificed by the added awareness visualization techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Quantifying Analytic Behavior</head><p>We quantify analytic behavior using (1) the attribute distribution (AD) metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and (2) relative frequency of interactions with data and attributes. The AD metric, along a scale from 0 (no bias) to 1 (high bias), characterizes how a user's interactive behavior deviates from expected behavior. By default, the system chooses a proportional baseline of expected behavior, wherein interactions with any given data point are equally likely, reflecting the true underlying distributions of attributes in the dataset. For example, if a user interacts primarily with PG-13 movies among a dataset of movies that contains predominantly G-rated movies, the AD metric for the Content Rating attribute will be high (more emphasis). If the user instead spent more time interacting with G-rated movies, proportional to the distributions in the dataset, the AD metric value for Content Rating would be low (less emphasis). Alternative baselines can be set using Lumos (Section 3.3.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">User Interface</head><p>The Lumos user interface consists of the following views: Hovering on a single datapoint (e.g., a strip in a strip plot) shows a list of all attribute values for the given datapoint (Figure <ref type="figure">1F</ref>). Hovering on an aggregation of datapoints (e.g., a bar of a bar chart) shows a table of all datapoints that belong to that aggregation (the bar) with attributes as columns and values as rows (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).  Based on user interaction logs with attributes and datapoints, Lumos computes analytic behavior and presents real-time interaction traces back to the user. Analytic behavior and interaction traces are observed in multiple ways in the interface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">In-situ Interaction Traces</head><p>Visualization Canvas. Lumos tracks user interactions with visual representations of datapoints (e.g., bars, lines, points, strips) and colors them on a white→blue scale based on the relative frequency of interactions, e.g., dark blue color represents more interactions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) and white represents no interactions (DG 2). Lumos captures mouseover interactions as a proxy for modeling analytic behavior from interactions with datapoints. Lumos employs a heuristic to ignore mouseovers that are active less than a 350 milliseconds threshold, regarded as random, accidental, or unintentional.</p><p>An interaction with a unit visualization (e.g., hovering on a point in a scatter plot of Running Time and Worldwide Gross) is handled differently than an interaction with an aggregate visualization (e.g., hovering on a bar showing average Running Time of Action movies). In the former scenario, Lumos treats it as one complete interaction with the corresponding datapoint incrementing its interaction counter by 1.</p><p>In the latter scenario, Lumos treats the interaction as a set of partial interactions with all constituent datapoints (e.g., all Action movies), incrementing their corresponding interaction counters by 1/N where N=number of constituent datapoints. Details View. When an aggregate visualization element (e.g, bar) is hovered on, the Details View below the chart shows a table with each datapoint. Lumos captures a mouseover on a table row, treats it as an interaction with the corresponding datapoint, and leaves an interaction trace by updating the table row's background color (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) (DG 2). Attribute Panel. Like datapoints, Lumos also tracks user interactions with attributes. Each attribute card in the Attribute Panel is colored on a white→blue scale based on the corresponding number of interactions (white=no interaction; darkest blue=most interactions). Lumos captures attribute assignments to encodings (e.g., X, Y) and filters (e.g., Gen-der=Male) as a proxy for modeling analytic behavior from interactions with attributes. These interactions are totaled and normalized relative to the most interacted attribute to determine the resultant shade of blue, e.g., in Figure <ref type="figure">1B</ref>, Genre has been interacted with most (dark blue) and Worldwide Gross has not been interacted with at all (DG 1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Ex-situ Interaction Traces</head><p>Lumos allows users to compare their analytic behavior with a target distribution. Attribute cards in the Distribution Panel are colored on a red→grey→green scale (Figure <ref type="figure">1G</ref>) based on the difference between their respective analytic behavior and underlying distributions (as quantified by Wall et al.'s AD metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, Section 2.2) (DG 4). In this evaluation, we set the target distribution to the underlying data. A red background indicates that the user's analytic behavior is different from the target distribution (green background indicates similarity). For example, inspecting the visualization for Production Budget shows the analytic behavior peaking around 150M (blue area) when most movies have a budget under 50M (black curve); the magnitude of the deviation is high resulting in a red background. Similarly, the computed analytic behavior (blue bars) on Content Rating is more closely matching the underlying data (black strips) resulting in a green background.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3">Configuring Different Target Distributions</head><p>Users can define target interactive analytic behavior in multiple ways:</p><p>(1) by proportional interactions across the various attribute distributions of the dataset, (2) by equal interactions across the categories of the dataset, and (3) by defining a custom target distribution of interactions across the data (DG3). For example, consider a dataset of job applicants, where 50% of applicants identify as male, 40% of applicants identify as female, and 10% of applicants identify as nonbinary. A proportional baseline would define the target distribution of interactive behavior such that 50% of interactions should be with male applicants, 40% with female applicants, and 10% with non-binary applicants, while an equal baseline would set the target distribution of interactions with 33.3% male applicants, 33.3% female applicants, and 33.3% non-binary applicants. If, for instance, diversity is a target in filling this particular role, then a custom baseline might be set, where the target interaction distribution is 40% female, 40% non-binary, and 20% male applicants. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> summarizes these settings in the context of a movies dataset for the Content Rating attribute, and shows (in blue) how the user's actual analytic behaviors compare to the target. Users can configure proportional, equal, or custom target distributions per attribute in Lumos. In the custom mode for categorical attributes, users are presented with an interactive bar chart where they can drag individual bars (each representing a category) to their desired relative weights. For quantitative attributes, users can sketch a target distribution by clicking (to add new quantiles) and dragging points in the presented interactive histogram. While Lumos supports all three target distribution variations, our study (Section 5) utilizes a proportional configuration by default. In this evaluation, we focus on obtaining qualitative feedback from users about awareness of analytic behavior and defer the study of users defining target distributions to future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.4">Feedback from Pilot Studies</head><p>The aforementioned Lumos interface and interaction design was realized after incorporating feedback from pilot studies with five participants. These helped us fix bugs, add enhancements (e.g., enable resizing the panels), reduce errors and slips (e.g., only showing the Aggregate encoding when applicable), and guide the design choices in the subsequent user study (e.g., we decided to remove the movie Title from the dataset as participants reported that their experiential knowledge stimulated saliency biases causing an exploration that neglected the underlying data almost entirely).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">EXAMPLE USAGE SCENARIOS 4.1 Scenario 1: Increasing awareness of analytic behavior</head><p>Assume Austin is looking for a new home and is exploring a housing dataset in Lumos (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). After acquainting themselves with Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>: Lumos supports ex-situ interaction traces for three modes of target distributions (Proportional, Equal, Custom). Lumos presents these targets in the charts as black curves/strips along with user behavior (blue area). Lumos also computes the difference between target and observed behavior and encodes it as the background color of the corresponding attribute card (red,grey,green colors where redder=more different; greener=more similar). the attributes, they apply three filters that match their criteria: {Home Type=Single Family; Price ≤ $300K; Satisfaction ≥ 7} (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>). Then, they create different visualizations by specifying encodings (Chart Type, X, Y, and Aggregation) in the Encoding panel (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>).</p><p>While interacting with these different visualizations, they observe visualization elements (e.g., bars, points) changing colors to different shades of blue. For example, in the scatterplot configuration with Lot Area (Y axis) and Year (X axis) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>), Austin observes their focus has been on smaller (Lot Area ≤ 60K) and more recently constructed (2009 ≤ Year ≤ 2010) homes. Similarly, in the barchart configuration with Foundation Type (X axis) and Average(Price) (Y axis) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d</ref>), they observe they have not focused on two types of Foundation Types: {Brick &amp; Tile, Poured Concrete} (white).</p><p>During their analyses, they also observe different shades of blue in the Attributes Panel (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5e</ref>) inferring they have not focused on all attributes equally, e.g., they focused more on Price and Satisfaction (darker blues), not so much on Year and Foundation Type (light blues) and not-at-all on Fireplaces and Heating Type (white).</p><p>After acknowledging that they did focus on the blue attributes, they start inspecting the five white attributes. They state they do not care about {Lot Config and Fence Type} but regret not focusing on the other three attributes (Heating Type, Fireplaces, Central Air) associated with climate control as the city faces severe winters. Accordingly, they apply new filters and encodings and continue their analyses.</p><p>In this way, Lumos helped Austin in house-hunting by making them more aware of their analytic behavior with data and attributes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Scenario 2: Mitigating biased analytic behavior</head><p>Taylor, a loan officer, is using Lumos to analyze loan applications to determine credit-worthiness. After exploring the dataset for a while, they observe a red Home Ownership Type attribute card and a green Age attribute card (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>) in the Distribution Panel. They express happiness at not exhibiting any age bias but are concerned that their interactions with Home Ownership Type significantly deviate from the underlying data (target) distribution. They click on the card to toggle it open and begin inspecting the visualization. They observe they have unknowingly overemphasized on Own and Rent and underemphasized on Mortgage Home Ownership Type.</p><p>Willing to correct their behavior, they apply a (reverse) filter: {Home Ownership Type=Mortgage} (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>) and analyze a few previously unconsidered (white) points (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6c</ref>). They finally see a greener Home Ownership Type card (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6d</ref>) and are more content.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Study Design</head><p>We conducted a between-subjects qualitative study with the aim of understanding how Lumos helps users increase awareness of their analytic behaviors. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by our institutional review board.</p><p>We recruited 24 participants (Gender: 14 male, 8 female, 1 other, 1 preferred not to say; Age in years: μ=24.04, σ =3.44, median=24, 1 preferred not to say). Participants included students, researchers, and industry professionals with diverse educational degrees (8 bachelors, 7 masters, 9 doctoral) all from a computing or related field (e.g., computer science, human-computer interaction, human-centered computing) with a self-reported visualization literacy ≥ 3 (on a 5-point Likert scale). Sessions lasted approximately 1 hour and participants were each compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card.</p><p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted the study remotely using online collaboration tools. The actual study was conducted over the Microsoft Teams (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/group-chat-software) teleconferencing software. The experimenter provided participants access to the study environment by sharing their computer's screen and granting input control.</p><p>Participants were randomly divided into either a Control or Awareness condition, which determined the version of the system they used for the study. Both conditions had roughly equal numbers of par-ticipants with bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees (Awareness: bachelors=4, masters=4, doctoral=4; Control: bachelors=4, masters=3, doctoral=5). Participants in the Control condition did not see the Distribution Panel (along with the ex-situ interaction traces) nor did they see the in-situ interaction traces in the Visualization Canvas, Details View, and Attribute Panel. We pre-configured the target distribution to Proportional and hid the Settings Panel for both conditions.</p><p>Each participant first electronically signed a consent form. Then, depending on the study condition, they saw a 2 minute (Control) or 4 minute (Awareness) video tutorial that demonstrated the features of Lumos. Participants were then asked to perform a practice task using a dataset of cars to interact with and get acquainted with Lumos. After practice, we tasked participants to "analyze a dataset of movies to recommend the characteristics of movies that a movie production company should make next". The dataset consisted of 709 movies (rows) and 9 attributes (columns): Production Budget (ɩ), Worldwide Gross (ɩ), Running Time (ɩ), IMDB Rating (ɩ), Rotten Tomatoes Rating (ɩ), Release Year ( ), Content Rating ( ), Genre ( ), and Creative Type ( ). Participants were encouraged to think aloud during the task. Throughout the task, their interactions were recorded. The study ended with a debriefing in which participants discussed their overall experience with the system, provided suggestions for improvements, and completed a questionnaire to rate the usefulness of Lumos features. All sessions were screen-and audio-recorded for qualitative analysis.</p></div>

P A 07 said "[they] don't really hover on things in e.g., a scatterplot but information shown on hovering a bar chart [the details view agg] was awesome because you showed individual data". Also, "it shows all information in one space." (P C 20, P C 24) and "could be useful for multivariate hypotheses" (P A 10). Two participants found it "hard to draw conclusions from lists of words and data" (P C 17, P C <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref> and preferred to see the information visually utilizing the Details View "only as a reference" (P C <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>. P C 18 utilized the Details View "because the visualization wasn't as helpful".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.3">Usefulness Scores: Lumos technique</head><p>Participants in the Awareness condition also saw in-situ and ex-situ (Distribution Panel) interaction traces in the user interface. Figure <ref type="figure">7b</ref> summarizes the usefulness scores (1=Not useful at all; 5=Extremely useful) as reported in the post-study questionnaire: Difference between analytic behavior and target distribution. Ten participants found the difference between their analytic behavior and the underlying data (red-green coloring in Distribution Panel) very useful (median A =5) "giving a sense if I'm looking at the dataset in an unbiased way" (P A 06). Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>: Summary of quantitative findings across the two experimental conditions, as RainCloudPlots <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. VIS=Visualization; Attr=Attribute.</p><p>Ex-situ interaction traces in Distribution Panel. The overall feedback on the ex-situ interaction traces in the Distribution Panel was positive; participants found the bar charts for N attributes (median A =4) more useful than the area charts for Q,T attributes (median A =4) with P A 06 nicely summarizing, "I can track and channel my focus based on discrete bar charts by applying a filter...but it is difficult to discretize and track a continuous [Q,T] attribute". For eight users, these real-time traces helped increase awareness ("Geez, I haven't looked at Drama movies at all"-P A 07), influencing them to interact differently (e.g., by creating a bar chart with Genre to inspect movies of other potentially underemphasized genres) while two participants either ignored them ("I never looked at the individual distributions of attributes"-P A 12) or preferred to look at them after analysis "as the bars will be moving, and that's distracting" (P A 09).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In-situ interaction traces in Visualization Canvas.</head><p>There was mixed response to the in-situ interaction traces (white-blue colors) in the Visualization Canvas (median A =3). For P A 06, they "helped in tracking visited points" nudging them to interact with points that were not interacted yet, while for P A 05 they were confusing and distracting, nudging them to re-interact with them. P A 08 did not want the colors to stay persistent but "be able to clear existing interactions and start a new session with a new set of model movies for comparison". In-situ interaction traces in Details View. Only four participants found the in-situ interaction traces (white-blue colors) in the Details View to be useful (median A =1). In-situ interaction traces in Attribute Panel. Participants generally found the in-situ interaction traces (white-blue colors) in the Attribute Panel to be useful (median A =4). For P A 05, they helped increase awareness of already-interacted attributes ("I see that I have spent a lot of time on Release Year so I'll now see something else") while for P A 12, they required some time to get acquainted with ("the coloring in the Attributes panel...I didn't use it initially, and later on it hit me that I had this feature. Once I noticed it, it was very useful"). Summary. Comparing the distributions of scores for the aforementioned features (Figure <ref type="figure">7b</ref>), participants found the ex-situ interaction traces more useful than the in-situ interaction traces, supporting H3, consistent with experimental results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. We believe this is because in-situ interaction traces are always visible to a user whereas ex-situ interaction traces can be used more on-demand without sidetracking the analysis task at hand. Furthermore, in-situ traces block an otherwise common attribute encoding channel, color, that can be undesirable for and cause inconvenience to some users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.4">Awareness Moments</head><p>In-situ traces in the Attributes Panel. There were instances when Control participants expressed a need for tracking the already-interacted attributes. For example, we observed P C 13 use hand gestures to recollect and count the attributes that they had already visited and P C 14 exclaimed, "I hope I have interacted with all (attributes)". Awareness participants, on the other hand, saw the interaction traces and had several instances of awareness during their respective analyses. Two participants acknowledged their choices ("I don't think Release Year should matter too much, hence I am not interacting with it."-P A 04, "I don't think Runnning Time is important to me"-P A 07) while two participants also suggested correcting future course via interaction ("I see that I have spent a lot of time on Release Year so I'll now see something else"-P A 05, "[on seeing a white attribute bar] now I'm going to interact with Running Time"-P A 22), also supporting H4. Two participants reflected upon their choices after the study while they were answering questions pertaining to self-reported focus on individual attributes in the post-study questionnaire ("actually I forgot, had I remembered, it might have been interesting to not click on the same thing over and over."-P A 03, "I didn't use the blue attributes panel but now that I see these questions, I would've seen them more"-P A 08). These and the desire for awareness moments by Control participants validate H1. In-situ traces in the Visualization Canvas and Details View. Eight participants found the in-situ interaction traces in the visualization canvas to be useful; two participants took some time to get acquainted with them ("very useful but I learnt about them slightly afterwards"-P A 01, "I was initially confused but then over use I got used to them and found them useful in tracking visited points"-P A 06). P A 03 found the colors to be useful but questioned the technique because "if it is based on [me] hovering on a point again and again, it might not be 100% correct." P A 05 was distracted and "getting drawn to the visited points (instead of the white un-visited points)." There was minimal commenting on the in-situ traces in the Details View but it led to some awareness for P A 04 who hovered on an uninteracted (white) bar in a bar chart and observed "there aren't many blue rows which means I haven't been focusing on it." Ex-situ traces in the Distribution Panel. There were multiple instances of awareness among participants (supporting H4). P A 04 verified the interactions traces by comparing it with ground truth ("distribution of my focus on Running Time (blue) is representative of the applied filter"). P A 05 reflected upon seeing three red attributes in the Distribution Panel and hypothesized that they were "just thinking aloud and exploring and will (now) follow a more targeted approach". P A 05 reflected upon seeing a red Content Rating attribute ("Seems I didn't interact with R-rated movies enough so this view nudges me towards those") and applied a filter to show only R-rated movies. P A 07 reflected upon the white Drama category in the Distribution Panel and justified that they "didn't care about Dramatization movies [...] who cares?" At one point, P A 07 observed many red cards and exclaimed, "this is so biased but whatever." P A 11 tried to correlate the effects of their interactions with different attributes ("I noticed that Adventure is representative of most values in Rotten Tomatoes Rating and IMDB Rating [...] This is because I mostly interacted with just Adventure movies and that caused those attributes [in the Distribution Panel] to be colored green"). P A 10 did not use the Distribution Panel as they "didn't know how to use it in the context of what [they were] doing".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.5">Interactive Behaviors across Experimental Conditions</head><p>Overall, Awareness participants exhibited more diverse behavior in terms of interactions with datapoints and attributes than Control (Figure <ref type="figure">8a</ref>; μ A =256, σ A =115; μ C =289, σ C =66), validating H2. Interactions with Datapoints. Figure <ref type="figure">8b</ref> shows the distribution of all interactions with datapoints across conditions (μ A =89.92, σ A =43.83, μ C =98.75; σ C =35.67). P A 08, on seeing the interaction traces, became fearful of skewing their interactions. Both conditions interacted with a similar number of unique datapoints (Figure <ref type="figure">8f</ref>; μ A =35.08, σ A =20.18, μ C =33.67; σ C =13.36) indicating that the in-situ blue colorings did not nudge participants to interact with more white points (in fact, P A 05 felt drawn towards the blue points). Interestingly, this result seems different from the one found by Hindsight <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, where participants tended to interact with more unique points when data were colored based on prior interactions. Figures <ref type="figure">8(e,i,m</ref> Interactions with Attributes. Figure <ref type="figure">8(c,d</ref>) show the distribution of total (μ A =35.75, σ A =17.8, μ C =37.42; σ C =18.25) and unique interactions (μ A =7.17, σ A =1.64, μ C =8.67, σ C =0.65) with attributes across conditions, respectively. Four awareness participants did not interact with certain attributes as they were not important to their analysis ("I don't think this [Running Time] is important to me"-P A 11) while two others tried to interact with more attributes to try and mitigate their biased analyic behaviors with attributes (P A 05) and datapoints (P A 07). Charts, Filters, and Encodings.</p><p>On average, Control participants created more charts (Figure <ref type="figure">8d</ref>; μ A =8.33, σ A =5.02, μ C =10.08, σ C =5.28), changed more encodings (Figure <ref type="figure">8h</ref>; μ A =16.58, σ A =7.86, μ C =23.00, σ C =13.11), and applied (Figure <ref type="figure">8l</ref>; μ A =4.17 σ A =5.65 minutes). P A 09 opened the cards but commented that they would prefer analyzing their performance after the task was over. One awareness participant did not utilize these cards as they were content with the red-green backgrounds of the closed cards (P A 12).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.6">Temporal analysis</head><p>To understand the cadence of interactions, we plotted hover, filter, encoding, and Distribution Panel interactions over time, and superimposed the AD metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> (representing analytic behavior) for each attribute. We found that for some participants who did not interact with these UI components, their analytic behavior was skewed for specific attributes (as evidenced by high AD metric values for Genre for P C 16 in Figure <ref type="figure">9a</ref>). For others, interactions led to significant shifts in analytic behavior. For instance, while P C 13 used Worldwide Gross as an encoding in a chart, their analytic behavior toward the attribute became more proportional to the underlying data (Figure <ref type="figure">9b</ref>). While a filter was applied to IMDB Rating (≥2.3 and ≤9.1), P A 09's analytic behavior began to deviate from the underlying data as shown by increasing AD metric value (Figure <ref type="figure">9c</ref>). Lastly, while we found instances where inspecting the Distribution Panel and accordingly interacting with the visualization appear to reduce biased analytic behavior (e.g., Figure <ref type="figure">9d</ref>, P A 01), such instances were not abundant among our participants. Thus, temporal analysis provides minimal evidence to support H4, but interaction traces provided participants opportunities to reflect on their analytic behavior, judging how their process differs from the baseline, and if that difference is appropriate for their task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Using Color to visualize interaction traces</head><p>Fun, Focus, Distraction, or Inconvenience? For P A 08, "interacting [with scatterplot points] and seeing colors change was fun" but for P A 05, it was a distraction as they were "getting drawn to the visited points [instead of the unvisited points]". P A 09 noted "highlighting the same data point over and over again skews the distribution visualization, which could be an issue" while P A 08 became "careful to not interact with dots and skew their interaction trace". P A 10 asserted "a hover does not imply I am interested in that point" and altogether ignored the blue colorings while P A 07 suggested capturing "mouse interactions based on proximity and not an exact hover" to compute analytic behavior. Next, using color to encode interaction traces took away an encoding channel that could otherwise be used by an attribute. In fact, P A 02 mentioned they "confused the blue colors with an [attribute] encoding". P A 12 also asked if there was "a reason for having the coloring throughout the visualization?" Furthermore, P A 12 raised an accessibility concern noting, "making the tool [Lumos ] color-blind safe would be really important". Thus, per our participants, using color to visualize interaction traces can be fun, cause a shift in emphasis, cause inconvenience, or be a distraction motivating the need to study alternate encoding approaches.</p><p>If not Color, then what? While in this evaluation of Lumos, we studied the usage of color (shades of blue, red, and green) to encode interaction traces, there are other visual variables that can be modified to encode and convey the same information, e.g., stroke color, stroke width, size, shape, orientation, opacity, etc. It must be noted that some visual variables might work better for certain visualizations than others (e.g., modifying color works better for a scatterplot than a strip plot) and that some variables may not even be applicable for certain visualizations (e.g., it is difficult to modify the shape of a line chart). Exploring this design space will help derive guidelines for effective in-situ and ex-situ visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">The role of target distributions</head><p>Target distributions in Lumos serve as a benchmark against which analytic behavior can be compared. For some tasks, meaningful target distributions may exist (e.g., forming committees with specific representation from certain groups). However, it may be harder to articulate a target distribution for other decision-making tasks, in which case standard baselines for comparison are more meaningful. Lumos allows users to modify these or use the data distribution as a default.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">False positives in modeling analytic behavior</head><p>The Lumos technique of presenting interaction traces can be subject to false positives. For example, users might intentionally not interact with an attribute because it is either not important or they are not interested in it. Labeling these as underemphasized may not be correct, as it was a conscious decision by users to ignore them. Furthermore, a categorical attribute, when encoded along one of the scatterplot axes, can lead to the formation of visual clusters that offload a cognitive task to a perceptual one, rendering that attribute's filter somewhat redundant. On the other hand, users can also unintentionally neglect aspects of data, e.g., the Attribute Panel may not be able to fit all attributes of a dataset, causing the attributes that are outside the viewport to be potentially neglected during analysis. Lumos helps the user tackle both: by showing unintentionally uninteracted attributes and by allowing users to intentionally set custom target distributions for attributes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Toward additional mitigation strategies</head><p>Based on Lumos results, interaction traces help increase the user's awareness of their analysis practices, sometimes influencing them to interact and mitigate unconscious biased analytic behaviors. We believe this is a passive mitigation strategy since the user has to inspect the difference between their analytic behavior and the target distribution and devise an appropriate strategy, e.g., by applying a filter. P A 01 and P A 08 suggested we implement a more active mitigation feature with "a button to automatically apply a reverse filter [instead of them having to manually apply it]", "especially for continuous attributes". For example, P A 06 saw their interactions with different Genres (Concert, Documentary, and Western) and reflected "[they] should now interact with Drama since that is maximum and these are almost nil". They applied a filter to correct their unintended underemphasis but after a few interactions found themselves overemphasizing towards Drama movies and reversed the filter. This act of balancing focus across all attributes can lead to frustration, sidelining the analysis task at hand. This is motivation to build mixed-initiative systems that assist the user in mitigating biased analytic behaviors either by acting on-demand (when the user clicks a "Mitigate" button for an attribute) or actively by automatically applying (or removing) a set of filters that negate the overemphasis (or underemphasis).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5">Lessons Learned</head><p>Encourage users to get lost in their analysis, but use awareness features to remind them. As described by the guidelines of "fluid interaction" <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, users may become less aware of their own process while performing in-depth analysis. Achieving this level of usability and utility in visualization tools is desirable, but raises the need for awareness functionality such as that in Lumos. Awareness features can help remind users that alternatives should be considered. Awareness of one's own activity is helpful, guidance towards best ways to mitigate may be better. Participants saw utility in interaction traces toward increasing awareness of their analysis processes. But, what's next? While users may be aware of potential biased analytic behaviors, there may not be a clear path forward to correct those. Thus it can be fruitful to explore guidance to help users actively mitigate biased analytic behaviors (e.g., by recommending data, visualizations, or filters that may draw a user's attention to overemphasized or underemphasized parts of the data). Different tasks call for different target distributions. "Biased analytic behaviors" (deviations from a baseline) in context of a movies dataset can likely be chalked up to relatively harmless preferences. However, given different analysis tasks, or different domain contexts (hiring, medical, etc), there may be a much more urgent need to ensure that the target baseline distribution is fit to the task. Lumos can provide the flexibility to specify custom target distributions accordingly. Promote awareness while maintaining user agency and control. While we maintain that user agency and control should be ensured, providing people with awareness of their analysis behavior has merit. At times, these goals may be at odds. For instance, if active strategies are employed for systems to automatically apply bias-mitigating measures, then agency may be compromised. These design decisions should be carefully considered when designing visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">LIMITATIONS</head><p>Lumos currently supports only a small set of visualization types; however, we chose them to test across different aggregation types. Also, analytic behavior is modeled only from interactions, which may not be a complete proxy for attention; in the future, one may consider user gaze or other sources to more accurately approximate it. Lastly, Lumos models analytic behavior by equally weighting the interactions. As P A 06 suggested to "remove older interactions, say only keep the most recent 100 or 200 of them [as] people lose attention [over time]", we may consider interaction recency in the future.</p><p>Finally, interactions with aggregate visualizations (e.g., hovering on a bar in a bar chart) are currently considered as N equally weighted interactions of magnitude 1/N where N = number of data points belonging to that element. This has variable impact on the metrics due to different statistical tests used to compute the analytic behavior model (AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>) depending on the attribute type (e.g., χ 2 test for categorical attributes, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for numerical distributions). Future work can explore alternative computations for models of analytic behavior that may reflect a user's attention and intentions more precisely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION</head><p>Lumos is a visual data analysis tool that models analytic behavior of users from their interaction history and provides real-time feedback for awareness and self-reflection of, e.g., overemphasis (or underemphasis) on aspects of data. Our evaluation found that Lumos increases users' awareness of their analysis behaviors in real-time, promoting reflection upon and acknowledgement of their intentions with the data. These results can have far-reaching implications toward mitigating biased analytic behaviors in decision making contexts, e.g., aid a hiring committee to meet their gender diversity targets and generally foster more transparent analysis processes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>(A) Data Panel shows the currently loaded dataset.
