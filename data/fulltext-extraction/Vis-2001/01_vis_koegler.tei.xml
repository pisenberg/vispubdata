<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The analysis of combustion and other reactive chemistries that involve turbulent flows is a challenging problem. Generally, simulation data for such problems have large numbers of variables with complex interactions, and structures that develop, such as flames, can be very amorphous in shape and composition. Data analysis can be very difficult even in two dimensions.</p><p>Feature tracking is a useful method for visualizing and analyzing scalar and vector datasets in a wide range of application. Just a small set of examples includes meteorology, oceanography, and the study of turbulent flows <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Feature tracking allows the scientist to focus on regions of interest within a dataset and allows quantification of these features' evolution over time. Combustion scientists are often interested in structures such as ignition kernels, flame fronts, and flame sheets. Thus feature tracking is an obvious method to try to improve analysis of these datasets.</p><p>The focus of this paper is to evaluate the usefulness of some basic feature tracking algorithms as analysis tools for combustion datasets by application to a dataset modeling autoignition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">CASE STUDY: AUTOIGNITION</head><p>The spontaneous ignition of flammable gaseous mixtures is relevant to the study of combustion in diesel engines. Of specific interest are the ignition and evolution of combustion in an inhomogeneous turbulent mixture of fuel and oxidizer, and the variables controlling these processes.</p><p>The autoignition process can be divided into three phases: 1) pre-ignition buildup of radicals and other reactive intermediates, 2) ignition, and 3) flame front propagation. Ignition may occur at a number of different times and locations. Once a site ignites, a flame front will spread out from that location, like a ripple on a pond. Qualitatively, the ignition will occur in areas where radical concentrations are high and flame fronts will spread preferentially into hot enough areas with the right mix of fuel to oxidizer. Feature tracking will help to quantify these events. For this study, the focus will be on the pre-ignition buildup of reactive intermediates.</p><p>The reaction system was comprised of hydrogen fuel (50% hydrogen/50% nitrogen by volume) at 300K mixed with the oxidizer (air: 21% oxygen/79% nitrogen by volume) at 1200K to achieve an average mixture fraction of 0.5 and pressure of 5 atmospheres. More details of the computation can be found in Echekki &amp; Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Data was provided as 69 time steps from 0 to 0.086 msec with time step intervals of about 0.0013 msec. The simulation domain was a 600 x 600 grid of size 0.378 cm. x 0.378 cm. The variables provided were the progress variable (a measure of completeness of combustion), temperature, and species mass fractions for the reactants: H 2 &amp; O 2 , the product: H 2 O, and intermediates: O, OH, H, HO 2 , and H 2 O 2 . For the analysis presented here, the datasets were reduced by a factor of 2 in each dimension to 90,000 elements and only every third time step was examined except where noted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">IMPLEMENTATION</head><p>The codes used in this study exist as a C++ library called FDTOOLS and are the initial steps in the design of a postprocessing tool for use on a variety of data structures including 2D &amp; 3D uniform and adaptive meshes. A major goal of development is reusability. These codes are being developed within the Common Component Architecture (CCA) specification <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Also, the codes are not integrated with a specific visualization package. A major advantage of this is that these codes can be used during a simulation for on-the-fly feature tracking.</p><p>The design of the data objects used by FDTOOLS borrows heavily from the design of data objects in VTK (Visualization Toolkit) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Data is manipulated through the virtual base class, 'fdDataSet', and datasets are made up of subclasses of 'fdCells' to allow higher level algorithms to perform without knowledge of the specific data structures.</p><p>The feature tracking is orchestrated through the 'feature manager' which manages a list of all features found during its lifetime, a list of currently existing features, and the different algorithms (encapsulated as objects) for the specific tasks of detection, tracking, and visualization. In the future, multiple algorithms will be available for each task.</p><p>The feature detection algorithm used was a basic segmentation scheme based on thresholding and region growing. A cell was considered to be part of a feature if its value fell between the two thresholds. If a cell passed this test, its neighbors were evaluated recursively until all failed the test. An array kept track of cells that had already been visited to ensure that every cell was tested only once.</p><p>The feature detector returns a list of locations of the features for each time step. The feature manager then uses output from the feature tracker to assign these locations to features, which exist across multiple time steps. A location contains a list of pointers to the cells in that region and various information about the location such as min/max/average values, size, bounding box coordinates, etc. A feature is defined as a list of locations, has a unique ID, knows whether it still exists at the current time step, and has pointers to its parents and children.</p><p>Tracking algorithms compare locations from the previous time step to the current time step and return a correspondence matrix where element e i,j = 1 if previous location, i, and new location, j, correspond. The tracking algorithm used first checked to see if the locations' bounding boxes overlapped. If they did, it then compared the cells in each location for overlap. The search space was first reduced by limiting the comparison to cells that occur in the overlap between the bounding boxes.</p><p>The feature manager updates its feature list in the following fashion: 1) If a new location does not correspond to any previous locations, it is a new feature. 2) If a previous and a new location overlap with only each other, the location is a continuing feature.</p><p>3) If a new location overlaps with multiple previous locations, it is a child of merging features, and 4) if multiple new locations overlap with a previous location, they are children of a splitting feature. Children of splits or merges are created as new features and their parent features are terminated. 5) If any previously existing features do not correspond to new locations, they are terminated.</p><p>An interface for visualization is currently provided by subclasses of 'fdVisualization' that supports basic methods such as 'vizArray' and 'vizCountours'. The current study used a subclass that encapsulated MATLAB and work is underway to provide a similar use of VTK.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RESULTS</head><p>The algorithms were evaluated by examining the features that resulted when defined as regions with high HO 2 concentrations. HO 2 concentration was chosen because it is one of the first intermediate species to show up. The initial case of thresholding HO 2 concentration at 1x10 -7 was arbitrarily chosen.</p><p>Selected time steps are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>. Initially little islands of high HO 2 slowly grow and occasionally merge. At later times, ignition events are evidenced by the presence of rings of   Features were detected by thresholding at 1x10 <ref type="bibr">-7</ref> . Feature labels are located at the lower left corner of their bounding boxes (sometimes quite far from outline). Because the images are scaled to maximum values which vary between time steps, a color bar is provided for each image. Note that in the last image, there are a few misclassifications: features #82 and #84 have been renumbered as features #90 and #92, features #81 and #83 have been renumbered #88 and #91, feature #11 has been renumbered #87, and feature #18 has been renumbered #89.   <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Classification events that occur between 0.047 and 0.085 msec by the tracking algorithm with coarse and fine time steps, compared to classification by hand. high HO 2 concentration that quickly spread as first seen in the upper right hand image in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> (time = 0.042640). An ignited feature grows a lot faster and adjacent features also get pushed and tend to move farther. Post ignition, there are many more merging events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Evaluation of Tracking Algorithm</head><p>The tracking algorithms worked very well in the pre-ignition period. At later time points, the algorithm had two types of problems. A number of examples can be seen in the last images in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>. Small, fast moving features were misclassified if they did not overlap in space between time steps. For example, features #87 and #89 were both incorrectly classified as new features instead of continuations of features #11 and #18. Another type of misclassification occurred when adjacent fast moving features overlapped between time steps. For example, the tracking algorithm identifies feature #90 as a child of the merging of features #82 and #84 and also incorrectly classifies #84 as a feature that splits. Tracking with smaller time steps should decrease the number of both types of errors. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the breakdown of classification events that occur during the later time steps for the test case with coarse and fine time steps. The misclassification of isolated fast moving features is indicated by the large number of "born" and "die" events. These are greatly reduced by using the smaller time steps. The misclassification of adjacent features is indicated by large numbers of merges and splits but can also be directly measured as a merge/split event. The number of merge/split events was not greatly affected by reducing the size of the time steps. Although even finer time steps may improve performance, it may be worthwhile to look into more sophisticated algorithms such as matching based on degree of overlap <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and/or attribute matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Effect of Choice of Threshold</head><p>The number of features at each time step for a number of threshold values is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 2</ref>. At early times, the number of features is very dependent on the threshold level but less so as time increases. Over the range of time of 0.02 to 0.06 msec, it appears that the number of features for thresholds at 5x10 -7 and 1x10 -6 are fairly constant. The average size of the features for each threshold level vs. time is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>. For all threshold levels the average size of the features increases with time. Also, the lower threshold levels tend to give larger average features sizes as would be expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Feature Based Analysis</head><p>Our definition of features includes some areas that eventually ignite. Our first question is what is different about these areas?</p><p>The range of values for the data set and the features of temperature and the concentrations of the reactants at time = 0.0116 msec are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. A plot of the average H 2 concentration of each feature vs. its average temperature is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref>. Each feature was followed through all time points and was classified (by hand) as igniting, extinguishing, or existing until consumed by a growing flame front. From the feature analysis, it is concluded that HO 2 concentrations build up in hot regions that have just enough H 2 (mass fraction of 0.002) and that initial average temperature is a good predictor for the feature's fate; hotter features are more likely to ignite. The behavior of the selected features with time can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5</ref> which plots the maximum temperature with time. Features that contained ignition sites are easily identified by their sudden jumps in temperature. It can also be seen that autoignition occurs at about the same time in feature #39, #46 &amp; #47 while feature #5 ignites a bit later.  1x10^ <ref type="bibr">(-8)</ref> 5x10^ <ref type="bibr">(-8)</ref> 1x10^ <ref type="table">(-7)</ref> 5x10^ <ref type="table">(-7)</ref> 1x10^(-6) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion &amp; Future Work</head><p>The application of feature tracking to this combustion problem was helpful in understanding the data but was also very useful in quantifying results which will be very valuable when comparing datasets with different initial conditions. In future work, more properties of the features will be examined including shape factors, velocities, and correlations with the other variables. Also, different definitions of features will be explored. Autoignition is a multiphase process and multiple definitions of features will be needed. The next feature to examine will be the flames (defined as areas of high heat release rates) that propagate through the mixture after ignition. The definition of a feature as a list of locations was adopted to enable feature IDs to persist in the absence of splitting or merging. However, this renders the computation of event statistics difficult since it necesitates the querying of each feature for its existence in the time period of interest. The future feature manager will be modified to store locations in lists for each time to simplify event calculations.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Selected time steps (6, 9, 12, 15, 18 &amp; 19) of HO 2 concentrations (time is in msec).</figDesc></figure>
