			<abstract>
				<p>We present the problem of visualizing time-varying medical data. Two medical imaging modalities are compared-MRI and dynamic SPECT. For each modality, we examine several derived scalar and vector quantities such as the change in intensity over time, the spatial gradient, and the change of the gradient over time. We compare several methods for presenting the data, including isosurfaces, direct volume rendering, and vector visualization using glyphs. These techniques may provide more information and context than methods currently used in practice; thus it is easier to discover temporal changes and abnormalities in a data set.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Time-varying data is common in medicine. Physicians frequently follow progression of disease and make treatment decisions based on periodic scans of a patient. For example, multiple sclerosis (MS) is a degenerative disease characterized by scar tissue that appears as bright lesions in spin-spin (T2) and proton density (PD) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain scans. Thus, physicians use sequences of MRI images to diagnose MS and track disease progression over several months or years.</p><p>Similarly, in nuclear medicine, function of a particular organ may be analyzed by measuring the temporal change of the spatial distribution of radioactive tracer bound to molecules with known biological function. These tracers are designed to concentrate at the organ of interest; hence, they visualize organ function.</p><p>At present, nuclear medicine dynamic studies are generally limited to planar single photon imaging, which gives poor localization and cannot be accurately corrected for attenuation effects. To address these issues, we use the new dynamic SPECT (dSPECT) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> that allows us to obtain quantitative information about kinetic processes in the body, from the data acquired using a standard clinical acquisition protocol. The result of dSPECT reconstruction, which includes attenuation and resolution recovery corrections, is a 4D data set composed of a time-series of 3D SPECT images. There are currently no methods to display and analyze this type of data.</p><p>One organ that can be analyzed using dSPECT is the kidney. Radioactive tracers in the bloodstream are expected to wash out in the kidneys and collect in the bladder as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig.1</ref>. We expect the activity to come down the aorta abdominalis (1) and flow into the aorta renalis (2). Here the activity will be distributed over the kidney cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> and then pass the medulla (4) to collect in the renalis pelvis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Approximately every 30 seconds, a small amount of urine containing the activity will flow down the ureter <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> to collect in the bladder (7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FIGURE 1. Hand-drawn diagram of flow through the kidneys</head><p>Currently, radiologists interested in temporal information from some imaging modality must manually compare 2D images of the same patient, acquired at different times, on a slice-by-slice basis. Such comparisons are difficult and time consuming; thus, not frequently done, particularly when the volumes are not aligned or the quantity of images is very large. Furthermore, 2D slices provide no information about 3D structure or rates of change.</p><p>We believe that visualizing time series data in 3D using flow visualization techniques could provide new insight into the information contained in the data and lead to improved diagnosis or treatment. For this reason, we are exploring techniques for visualizing time-varying medical data, and analyzing their effectiveness for MRI and dSPECT. {mktory, torsten, stella}@cs.sfu.ca, nroeber@mail.cs.uni-magdeburg.de, aceller@physics.ubc.ca</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Previous Work</head><p>Methods to visualize volume data, primarily isosurface extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>[13] <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and direct volume rendering (DVR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>[3] <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> have been extensively studied. Recent developments have produced efficient data structures and algorithms for rendering time-series volume data <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. However, we are unaware of other work extending volume visualization methods to 4D medical data sets.</p><p>By contrast, several 4D visualization techniques have been developed for flow visualization. These include glyphs, streamlines/timelines, texture advection, and line integral convolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>[6] <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Initial investigation into the problems of visualizing dSPECT and MRI time series data can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In addition, a few recent attempts have been made to apply flow visualization ideas to tensor data from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Kindlmann and Weinstein use volume rendering with novel methods for assigning colour and opacity values <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Laidlaw et al. use oriented "brush strokes" to visualize tensors, in a manner similar to glyph visualization or texture advection <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> visualize tensors with the aid of stream tubes and stream surfaces. These techniques are effective for tensor data in particular applications, but have not been applied generally to vector visualization in medical data sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Approach</head><p>Since methods to visualize 4D fluid flow have been extensively studied, we felt these techniques would be a good starting point for our investigation. Our approach is to look at techniques developed for other applications and evaluate how and when they work for 4D medical data. Results of this evaluation will be used to develop new techniques in places where existing methods are inadequate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data Preparation and Preprocessing</head><p>Our MRI data consisted of 11 time steps (each one month apart) with dimensions 256 x 256 x 22 slices. Brain tissue and MS lesions were segmented from each slice using methods given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Registration was necessary since a slight change in head position could produce misregistration artefacts as large as real lesion changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Registration was accomplished using Automated Image Registration <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Parameters for registration and additional preprocessing details can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Dynamic SPECT data was acquired with a Siemens e.cam camera with two heads, 90 degrees apart, and with single 180 degrees rotation. The data was reconstructed using the dSPECT reconstruction, which yields 4D dynamic SPECT data. The matrix size of the reconstructed spatial image was 35 x 50 x 80 (with voxel size 4.7 mm 3 ). Total acquisition time was 12 minutes and 64 temporal frames were recorded. Attenuation and resolution recovery correction were used in reconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>[8].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Vector Extraction</head><p>Before visualizing the change over time in a data set, we needed to understand what changes we wanted to see.</p><p>For dynamic SPECT, we had clear expectations of how activity should flow, so we could use a flow simulation model to calculate flow vectors. First, a 3D region of interest mask was used to classify each voxel to a particular tissue. Using voxel classification and position, an average flow direction and velocity for the voxel were computed. These vectors were fit to the real data in a second iteration step. To compute the final flow direction and velocity we assumed a homogeneous flow field. For most tissues the vectors are nearly constant over time; only the ureter has a periodic flow with a maximum around every 30 seconds. The flow direction and speed were computed using the initial flow vector, the flow direction of neighbouring voxels, and the rate of change of the voxel time-activity-curve. The resulting vectors represented the flow of the radioactively labeled molecules.</p><p>For MRI, expectations of how intensities would change over time were less clear, and anatomical masks for every tissue type were unavailable. Hence, we defined the following quantities:</p><p>Note that dG/dt (the change in gradient over time) is equivalent to the spatial change of dI/dt; thus, this quantity may provide a good indication of spatial movement over time, while dI/dt should give us an idea of how intensities are changing temporally. However, these vectors are merely a starting point for exploration into the data set; their physiological meaning is unclear and it is not obvious that they will provide interesting or useful information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Visualization Methods</head><p>We explored several visualization methods: isosurfaces, DVR, and glyphs, to compare their effectiveness for the two imaging modalities and applications. All of our methods were implemented with the aid of the Visualization Tool Kit <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In addition, we used IDL <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> for some dSPECT visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Isosurfaces</head><p>Semi-transparent isosurfaces from different time frames were displayed together and coloured by time. Isovalues for each time frame could be modified interactively. Additional isosurfaces (the brain for MRI and the kidneys for dSPECT) provided context and orientation cues. Furthermore, users could interactively rotate, zoom, and pan the display, change isovalues and opacities for each time frame, and step through time as an interactive animation.</p><p>For MRI, we had the advantage of segmented brain and lesion data. Thus, a very low isovalue could be selected to easily separate lesion or brain tissue from the background in the segmented data sets. For dSPECT, isovalues were found by trial and error, with the kidney having a lower isovalue than regions with high activity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Direct Volume Rendering</head><p>We visualized intensity (I) and change in intensity over time (dI/dt) using DVR. For intensity data (I), the transfer function highlighted high intensity regions. For dI/dt, it was designed to indicate magnitude and direction of the change at each voxel. Interaction and surface models of the brain/kidneys were incorporated similar to the isosurface program described above. In addition, animations showing cumulative changes over time could be generated.</p><p>In the segmented MRI data, non-lesion material had a value of zero; hence, size changes appeared as large intensity changes. This effect could easily be removed by using unsegmented data to calculate dI/dt; however, the effect is not necessarily undesirable since it highlights changes in shape, which may be important.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3">Glyphs</head><p>Glyphs were used to visualize flow vectors for dSPECT, and dI/dt, G, and dG/dt for MRI. In many cases, isosurfaces of the data were included for orientation purposes (i.e. brain and lesions for MRI and kidneys for dSPECT). Two types of glyphs were utilized: 3D glyphs with a cone geometry and hedgehogs with a line geometry.</p><p>Generally, glyph colour and length represented vector magnitude, while orientation illustrated flow direction. However, for the 1D dI/dt vectors, colour represented whether the change was negative or positive, and length indicated change magnitude. Glyph orientation was either (1) in exact opposite directions for negative and positive change or (2) in the direction of the surface normal, with the idea that lesion areas may be thought of as "growing outwards"or "shrinking inwards" along the surface normal. For MRI ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.2 (a)</ref>), isosurfaces provide a 3D impression of lesion position, orientation, and volume. Since several data sets can be displayed, it is possible to see that some older lesions disappeared (blue areas) and some new lesions appeared (red areas).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results and Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Isosurfaces</head><p>In our dSPECT kidney study, we are interested in where the activity is located and how fast it washes out. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.2 (b)</ref> shows a shrinking iso-surface illustrating the washout process. In the first time step (green), most activity is contained in the cortex, while in the last one (blue), most activity is in the pelvis.</p><p>Note that because 3D objects are projected into two dimensions, colour combinations may be caused by isosurfaces lying behind one another rather than at the same location. Interactive rotation of objects improves understanding of 3D orientation, contributing to the resolution of this problem. Also, increasing the number of isosurfaces causes complete occlusion of some objects. To address this, we developed tools to allow users to interactively change opacities and isovalues for individual contours.</p><p>Animations showing changes in isosurfaces allow all time steps to be viewed without occlusion. These animations can either be generated for a single viewpoint and viewed offline, or run interactively so the user can step back and forth through time frames and change parameters and viewing direction at any time.</p><p>Although our isosurface programs run at interactive speeds, the information they provide is natually limited to surfaces. We explored DVR and glyphs to address this issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Direct Volume Rendering</head><p>We use DVR to visualize scalar values I and dI/dt. Because we used the VTK ray-tracer rather than a faster volume renderer, interaction was slow. However, DVR provided interesting information as described below, and we feel the speed issue can be easily addressed using existing algorithms.</p><p>For dSPECT, where there is a clear flow of activity, we found it most useful to render intensity values and illustrate change over time using animation.The single focal point at the center of the activity makes it easy for viewers to follow the change in activity throughout the animation. Moreover, intensity values may be more natural to visualize than change in intensity. <ref type="figure">Fig.3 (b)</ref> and (c) show two frames from a direct volume rendered animation of dSPECT data. Areas with low activity appear green, while areas with high activity are coloured red. You can clearly see that in (b) most activity is contained in the kidney cortex and medulla. In (c), three time frames later, we can see that a lot of activity has washed out and collected in the pelvis.</p><p>By contrast, for MRI, we found that rendering intensities and displaying the time dimension using animation was not effective.</p><p>Animations showing intensity allow the user to see global changes (e.g. if many lesions in one area changed in a similar way). However, there is no clear focal point, and attentive search is required to identify the (more common) small, localized changes.</p><p>A direct volume rendered image of dI/dt changes in MS lesions is displayed in <ref type="figure">Fig.3 (a)</ref>. This figure illustrates that localized intensity changes occurred in the MS lesions. For example, the bluish spot in the middle represents an intensity drop, while several red and brown spots represent intensity increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Glyphs</head><p>For dSPECT, glyphs and hedgehogs are used to visualize flow of activity. <ref type="figure">Fig.4 (c)</ref> shows the flow visualized using 3D glyphs. The cone geometry clearly shows flow direction; furthermore, glyph length and colour make it easy to see the speed of the washout.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig.4 (d)</ref>, hedgehogs indicate flow towards the pelvis and down the ureter. Colour represents the concentration of activity; you can see that the concentration in the kidney cortex and medulla are higher than in the pelvis.</p><p>In an animation, we would see that most vectors remain the same in speed and direction. However, in the ureter, the flow direction would remain constant, but the velocity would change periodically, with a maximum approximately every 30 seconds. <ref type="figure">Fig.4 (a)</ref> and (b) show glyphs and hedgehogs for dG/dt vectors in MRI. As expected, no global pattern of flow can be seen. In (a), several glyphs point in a similar direction for a localized area near a lesion. This indicates a change in the lesion at that point. However, such patterns are much less frequent than we hoped, and require extensive searching by the user. In addition, context information is lost as the user zooms in to search for local patterns, so keeping track of the current position is difficult. A second, global view showing position may fix this problem.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig.5</ref>, glyphs are used to visualize dI/dt values from MRI. Here, global trends are easy to see, especially with glyph colouring. The user can then zoom into areas of interest to gain more detailed understanding of changes in that area.</p><p>Overall, glyphs ran at interactive frame rates and provided detailed information at selected points. However, glyphs are not a global technique, so the images appear cluttered. Hence we are exploring other methods such as streamlines. Initial results are promising for dSPECT (see <ref type="figure">Fig.6</ref>); however, the MRI data is challenging due to low image resolution and lack of a clear flow direction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Challenges</head><p>We encountered several challenges worthy of mention. First, it is unclear which quantities are most informative. We experimented with some simple quantities, but it is not clear how to validate these against medical criteria. Further, we found the limited resolution in the slice dimension of our MRI data (22 slices) to be a problem. Rendering these data sets from a side viewpoint resulted in very blurry images. Interpolation to produce additional slices may reduce this problem, but would not remove the additional problem that some small lesions could be missed altogether due to partial volume effects. Increasing the number of slices during acquisition is not practical since this increases scan time such that patient motion becomes problematic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions And Future Work</head><p>We have presented several methods for visualizing time varying medical image data. These techniques have the potential to compress large quantities of data into a single image, as well as provide new measures currently not used for diagnosis, such as rates of change. These techniques can provide more information and context than a slice by slice visualization could do; as a result, it is easier to discover temporal changes and abnormalities in a data set. Since gaining a short or long-term dynamic picture of a patient's physiology could help physicians understand disease progression, we believe tools such as ours could be of great use to physicians trying to formulate diagnoses or treatment plans.</p><p>Improved interaction and iterative development and evaluation of graphic interfaces will improve effectiveness of our visualizations. Particular attention should be paid to perceptual issues related to design. Correlation of new measures, such as velocity or rates of change, with existing disease measures will be essential for their validation. Other future work includes optimizing the programs for speed, exploring new visualization techniques, and considering other imaging modalities and applications.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>,y,z,t) Intensity in the volume, a function of 3 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension (scalar value) dI/dt Change in I over time, calculated by forward differencing (positive or negative scalar value) G(x,y,z,t) Spatial gradient at each point, calculated by central differencing (vector) dG/dt Change in gradient over time, calculated by forward differencing (vector)</figDesc></figure>
