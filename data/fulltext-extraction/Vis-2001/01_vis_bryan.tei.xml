			<abstract>
				<p>The Temporal Bone Dissection Simulator is an ongoing research project for the construction of a synthetic environment suitable for virtual dissection of human temporal bone and related anatomy. Funded by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), the primary goal of this project is to provide a safe, robust, and cost-effective virtual environment for learning the anatomy and surgical procedures associated with the temporal bone. Direct volume visualization has been indispensable for the necessary level of realism and interactivity that is vital to the success of this project. This work is being conducted by the Ohio Supercomputer Center in conjunction with the Department of Otolaryngology at t he Ohio State University, and NIDCD.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">BACKGROUND</head><p>The temporal bones are located on the side of the human skull, above and behind the jaw and surrounding the ear canal (see Color Plate 1). This area includes the auditory anatomy, the facial nerve, and vestibular organs and is the subject of many important and delicate procedures, such as exploratory and corrective surgery, biopsies, tumor removal, and implants <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. This region is very complex, and the many small and fragile structures it contains makes it one of the most challenging areas for surgical intervention and to understand <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Surgeons typically require many years of study to become familiar with three-dimensional anatomic relationships and gain proficiency in related surgical procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Conventional training is achieved by means of printed material and sessions in a dissection lab; however these methods are both time consuming and expensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Kuppersmith et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and Nelson <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> provide excellent descriptions of the essential temporal bone dissection lab, which consists of one or more stations, each with a temporal bone holder, a binocular microscope, a suction-irrigation device, and a drill. Using this equipment, a resident or surgeon performs a dissection by removing bone with the drill and removing fluid and bone dust with a suction-irrigation device. Structures are systematically exposed or removed in accordance with a manual or under direct supervision.</p><p>The drawbacks of a physical temporal bone dissection are that it requires the use of a dedicated laboratory and personnel as well as bone samples harvested from cadavers or synthetic plastic models <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. Inconsistent supplies of cadaveric bone, typically limited to adult samples, can make it difficult to learn rare or specialized procedures or to practice on infant or child anatomy. Cadaveric samples also carry the risk of infection, and dissections are usually limited to one per sample, so mistakes can be costly <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Synthetic m odels offer a safer and lower cost alternative to cadaveric samples, but do not yet fully duplicate the behavior or pathological diversity of real bone. In addition, while dissection is the primary means for surgical training, the dissection lab fails to fully reproduce the detail and scope of an in-vivo surgical environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>The primary goal of our simulation is to provide a customizable and more complete alternative to learning anatomy and surgical technique as opposed to printed media or physical dissections. We hypothesize that this will allow a more thorough and rapid means of assimilating anatomy and procedure than conventional techniques. This hypothesis and the efficacy of the simulation will be evaluated in a resident program at The Ohio State University later this year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PREVIOUS WORK</head><p>A fair amount of research has emerged in recent years for visualizing and simulating interaction with virtual temporal bones. One of the first such systems was developed by Harada et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and used three-dimensional reconstruction of histological cross sections of the temporal bone in order to increase understanding of the anatomy. The virtual bone could be arbitrarily oriented, sliced, and removed but required extensive preprocessing and was monochromatic. Kuppersmith et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> provide excellent delineation for the construction of a virtual temporal bone dissection simulator and have developed a preliminary system. Their system renders geometric surfaces extracted and segmented from Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, and uses haptic and aural feedback to increase realism. Mason et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> have developed a virtual temporal bone system in the form of an integrated teaching tool. Histological slices were scanned, aligned, manually segmented, and then converted to geometric surfaces. The model was subsequently displayed stereoscopically in a CAVE environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, allowing a user to arbitrarily orient and alter the visibility of anatomy in order to learn the functional relationships between structures. John et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> are currently developing a surgical simulator beginning with a detailed task analysis and leading up to the implementation of a system for preoperative planning, surgical simulation, education, and training. The project presented in this document is most similar to that of Kuppersmith et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The major differences include the use of direct volume rendering for visualization, construction of a synthetic dissection workstation, emphasis on training through a combination of identification and exposure of key structures, and integration of an intelligent tutor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">IMPLEMENTATION</head><p>Our simulation educates and trains users through tasks based on the exposure and identification of key structures. The system consists of two parts, each requiring a user to perform tasks consistent with a laboratory manual of the temporal bone region. The first part of the system is the dissection simulator for learning surgical procedures. The primary goal here is to gain experience and proficiency by manipulating a virtual drill and virtual suction-irrigation device to expose specific structures and to follow surgical protocol. The second part of the system incorporates aspects of an intelligent tutor for learning anatomy through interactive identification. Tasks performed in this part include identification of emphasized anatomy, manipulating the virtual bone to find and select specific anatomic structures requested by the tutor, querying the tutor to locate specific anatomy, and watching virtual dissections regenerated from expert tracing. The simulation allows the user to easily learn relevant anatomy, while preserving a surgical context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Requirements</head><p>The system requires enough realism to replace or augment conventional training, while remaining technically feasible and cost-effective with current technology.</p><p>The system must provide stereoscopic presentation to duplicate stereoscopy from a binocular microscope. Two haptic (force-feedback) input devices are required to simulate the bone drill and suction-irrigation device, allowing a user to effectively interact with the bone and perform the dissection. The system must synthesize audio cues to simulate the pitch and frequency changes of the drilling burr during its interaction with bone. Most importantly the system must provide a high degree of interactivity during the virtual dissection to eliminate user-induced oscillations and control errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The goal for this project is to provide sustained frame rates between 15 and 20 frames per second during interactions with the virtual bone.</p><p>The intelligent tutor portion of the simulator requires the ability to dynamically emphasize and distinguish structures for the purposes of identification. For example, the tutor will select and emphasize a specific structure by rendering all unselected structures semi-transparent and monochromatic, and the selected structure fully opaque in an emphasizing color. The tutor will then ask the user to identify the structure. Alternatively, a user can ask the tutor to locate a specific structure, at which time the tutor will emphasize it in the same manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Architecture</head><p>The existing system has been developed on a fourprocessor Silicon Graphics Onyx2, with 1 GB main memory and 64 MB texture memory. A PHANTOM™ 1.5 haptic interface device from Sensable Technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is used to simulate the drill, and a PHANTOM™ Desktop simulates the suctionirrigation device. A Virtual Research V8 binocular display system simulates the binocular microscope. For optimal compatibility with this display device, two 640x480 viewports are rendered by the system, one for each eye. A version of the system has also been ported to a Silicon Graphics Octane2 system, although there is a slight drop in visualization performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Data</head><p>The primary temporal bone data used by the simulator is a 64MB (128x256x512, RGBA) anisotropic volume with a voxel resolution of 0.2x0.2x0.5mm 3 derived from CT and MRI acquisitions. Higher resolution volumes, including microCT acquisitions, will be obtained and incorporated later in the project. To avoid expensive texture swaps in the graphics hardware, this and future volume acquisitions will be constrained to fit wholly in available texture memory. The acquired volume is segmented manually into various features by a team of experts. Although autosegmentation methods exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, they are not capable of functional segmentation. That is, automatic segmentation fails because there is no inherent information in the data to delineate functional differences. Custom software allows experts to directly segment volumetric structures in stereoscopic clarity using the same visualization software used by the simulation. The acquired volume is manually colored using transfer functions and direct 3D "painting" to produce a volume that more closely resembles real anatomy, and an opacity channel is added by filtering occupancy information. The opacity channel is used by the visualization algorithm to increase image quality. The final temporal bone volume consists of five channels: three color channels, an opacity channel, and a segment channel.</p><p>The drilling burr used in a real dissection is a small tungsten-carbide or diamond burr attached to a drill. Large tungsten-carbide burrs are generally used for coarse and rapid bone removal, with smaller diamond burrs used for more detailed work. In the simulator, the drilling burr is represented virtually by a polygonal ellipsoid (for visualization) and a modification kernel containing an ellipsoidal mask (for modification). Drilling is simulated by interactively positioning the virtual burr in the volume, with the mask controlling how voxels in the volume are modified. Currently, voxels are "removed" by making them partially or wholly transparent. In the future, removed voxels will also be actively "thrown," based on the speed and orientation of the drilling burr, and propagated until they hit other stationary voxels, in order to simulate bone dust. This dust can then be removed by the suction-irrigation device.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Visualization Technique</head><p>Visualization is implemented using direct volume rendering methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, rather that indirect methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, to reduce overhead associated with frequent modifications to volume data. Specifically, a three-dimensional texture-map-based volume-rendering algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> implemented in OpenGL 1.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> renders the temporal bone data. This method was selected for several reasons: it is easy to implement; it makes direct use of acquired data with little to no preprocessing; it supports the frame rates necessary for effective interaction; no additional processing is required as a result of direct local or global changes to the data; and it is extremely efficient on the selected development platform. Other volume rendering methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> required complicated or expensive algorithms to incorporate local modification, or were otherwise too slow under current implementations. Meiβner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> provide a thorough and a ccurate qualitative comparison of popular visualization techniques, including texture mapping, and are one justification for this choice. Direct rendering via auxiliary dedicated hardware <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> is a promising technology that emerged after the start of the p roject but is currently limited to orthographic projection of 8 or 12 bit monochromatic data and consequently does not meet the requirements of this project.</p><p>Despite the speed of the texture-map-based visualization algorithm, direct rendering of the entire volume to two 640x480 viewports yields no more than two or three frames per second. This sluggish performance is due to pixel-fill performance inherent in the visualization hardware. Two techniques increase performance during interactions with the virtual bone: one during local interaction (e.g. drilling and palpation), and one during global interaction (e.g. viewpoint changes). During local interactions, only the portion of the viewport affected by the interaction is re-rendered, since the rest of the image remains unchanged. During global interactions, the viewport is remapped to a size similar to the volume dimensions (e.g. 256x256), and the volume rendered to the smaller viewport. The final image in the smaller viewport is then texture-mapped to fill the original viewport. Image quality in this case is slightly reduced; however use of this method is justified by the dramatic increase in interactivity. When global interaction ends, the volume is rendered to the original viewport (i.e. 640x480), for maximum quality. Additional information on the visualization and interaction techniques employed by our system can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CURRENT SYSTEM</head><p>The system supports arbitrary dissection of virtual temporal bone data acquired from CT and MRI scans. The simulation includes stereoscopic presentation with aural and haptic feedback. Interactive rates during bone removal peak at around 20 frames per second, with an average of around 15 frames per second. Force-feedback is computed on the virtual drilling burr by a spherical force-field of virtual springs, which sense their distance to the volume using ray-cast techniques. At this time, the suction-irrigation device has not been fully integrated into the system. Synthesized audio is generated from a combination of multi-harmonic sinusoids and white noise, and is modulated based on drill speed and the haptic response. An in-context GUI provides access to various options and the tutor utilities, allowing the user to access all features from within the surgical context. Drilling rates are controlled by a modified Xomed foot-pedal, with the on-screen GUI accessed through a button on the PHANTOM™ input device.</p><p>Color Plate 2 shows a user performing a virtual dissection in the system. Color Plate 3 illustrates the in-context GUI and the ability of the tutor to selectively emphasize specific structures in response to a user query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">RESULTS</head><p>The user community has been introduced to the simulator through individual demonstrations in our lab and through presentations at local symposia. This community comprises residents, local otologic surgeons, and teaching faculty. Local experts, i.e., faculty surgeons, have provided face and construct validity through formative evaluations throughout development. Controlled studies for summative evaluation to determine concurrent and predictive validity, as well as reliability, are scheduled for the autumn quarter of the 2001-2002 school year, with results to be published in 2002. During the study, the simulator will be placed in the temporal bone dissection laboratory of the Department of Otolaryngology at The Ohio State University for use during the surgical techniques portion of the temporal bone curriculum.</p><p>Although major results are still forthcoming, initial responses to the simulator have been very positive. The overwhelming sentiment has been a general sense of excitement. Most users appreciate the novelty of the simulator, and describe situations where its features would be useful in enhancing their ability to study the temporal bone region. The intelligent tutor and its user tracing features have also been well received. Key criticisms have addressed haptic performance and credibility, along with visual realism, both of which are scheduled for refinement later in the project.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>Hardware restrictions inherent in the development platform currently constrain the size of the temporal bone volume to 64MB or less, if sufficient interactivity is to be maintained. This constraint will become more problematic as the size and resolution of acquisitions increase. Future acquisitions may yield volumes with dimensions of 1024x1024xN or greater. Larger volumes also lead to problems with segmentation, as it is largely manual. Although time consuming, custom segmentation software is helping to reduce this overhead. Performance of the existing system depends heavily on the development platform. While augmenting the visualization algorithms boosted performance during global and local interactions, these modifications barely allow the simulator to meet minimum interactivity requirements.</p><p>Advances in technology and the development of novel visualization algorithms are expected to mitigate or eliminate many of these hardware limitations. In particular, improvements in the speed of rendering algorithms and the proliferation of cheaper and more powerful graphics cards will make the system more portable and facilitate efforts to increase realism. As this project continues, the system's capabilities will be expanded to include simulated bone dust, bleeding and irrigation, soft tissue modeling and dynamics, support for multi-resolution volumes, and assessment protocols.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>In summary, we have presented a working prototype system for virtual simulation of temporal bone dissection. The system offers a paradigm from traditional practices by integrating technological advances to provide a safer and more cost-effective way to learn fundamental techniques used in temporal bone surgeries. Our methods have produced a real-time interactive volumetric system obviating the need for physical materials in initial training. It provides a more accessible way for residents to practice dissection and surgical techniques and to increase exposure to pathological variance. The recreation of temporal bone dissection in a realistic, synthesized, interactive session will serve as both an anatomical tutorial and a surgical technique simulator. Through continued refinements and evaluation, we are confident that the system is easily extensible to preoperative assessment, presurgical planning, and surgical documentation.</p></div>		</body>
