				<p>This paper presents a novel method to estimate illuminationdependent properties in image synthesis prior to rendering. A preprocessing step is described in which a linear image basis is developed and a lighting-independent formulation defined. A reflection function, similar to hemispherical reflectance, approximates normal Lambertian shading. Intensity errors resulting from this approximation are reduced by use of a polynomial gamma correction function and scaling to a normalized display range. This produces images that are similar to normal Lambertian shading without employing the maximum (max) function. For a single object view, images can then be expressed in a linear form so that lighting direction can be factored out. During normal rendering, image quantities for arbitrary light directions can be found without rendering. This method is demonstrated for estimating image intensity and level-of-detail (LOD) error prior to rendering an object.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>This work describes a technique for approximating image quantities without rendering, and presents example applications to illumination estimation and perceptual based LOD selection under novel lighting directions. Our method employes only sample images and is appropriate for polygonal, point rendering, and volume visualization. We overcome a limitation of the nonlinear max function, normally employed in Lambertian shading, to produce a sample image basis. This nonlinearity does not permit the expression of the illumination equation in linear form so that lighting direction may be factored out from object geometry. In our method, for a given view an image corresponding to an arbitrary light vector is expressed as the weighted sum of a set of basis images. Lambertian-like reflection maps are obtained by applying polynomial gamma correction and scaling to sample images with a hemispherical shading function. We call our approximation technique gamma corrected hemispherical shading (GCHS). Global or local quantities such as direct illumination may then be calculated for arbitrary illuminant directions using pre-computed means of basis images. To determine LOD-induced perceptual error, the preprocessing phase can also calculate illumination independent error values from image signal power differences resulting from LOD object models, relative to high-resolution models. This difference can be modulated by a visual contrast sensitivity function (CSF) to allow imperceptible differences. During normal rendering the estimated error would be employed to select the LOD model with desired error as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. The reason for estimating direct illumination and for making error a function of lighting direction as well as viewing direction is to allow greater simplification of surfaces that are not visible to the light or do not change significantly, such as regions of no or ambient only illumination.</p><p>Images produced by normal Lambertian shading and GCHS shading are depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Note the similarity between GCHS and normal images. Gamma correction generally compensates for nonlinear image formation in video, film, and synthetic images <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Larson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> have employed gamma correction through histogram modification to locally preserve image contrast. Tumblin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> have described methods with gamma transforms to compress layers of objects in digital imagery to preserve scene contrast. We apply gamma correction to better approximate nonlinear effect of the max function to eliminate negative pixels in Lambertian shading. We propose a basis expansion where weights for an arbitrary image are computed by projecting the associated light vector onto those corresponding to each basis image. The polynomial gamma correction allows light vector weights to be separated from the sample basis images. Illumination-independent image quantities, even those employing Fourier or other linear transforms, can then be pre-calculated for use during image synthesis for arbitrary lighting directions.</p><p>The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of previous work. Section 3 describes difficulties associated with the nonlinear max function and develops a linear shading method from the hemispherical reflection function. In Section 4 we describe our GCHS correction method to reduce the visible difference between approximate linear shading and Lambertian shading, with example results. Section 5 describes the computation of image quantities under changing illumination without re-rendering, including intensity estimates and frequency-space perceptual error metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Section 6 presents an approach to reduce the size of the basis used in GCHS. Finally, conclusions and directions for future work are presented in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">RELATED WORK</head><p>The desire for photorealistic and interactive rendering has led to developments including image-based rendering <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, point rendering <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, and several polygon-based simplification methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Given desired frame rates and computational limitations, allowing some degree of error in images is often necessary. This can result from limits on image cache sizes, volumetric point resampling, or by less dense surface approximations in polygonal models. Quantifying the effects of rendering error in synthetic images has been studied in relation to early termination of expensive global illumination algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, volume rendering <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and mesh simplification <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Rushmeier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> employed real images and images computed from different global illumination algorithms to calculate a frequency-space error. Significantly, they included visual perception so that errors which were more easily detectable by the eye were given more weight. Image error as a function of illumination intensity has been described by Ramasubramanian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> using pre-computed spatial error potential maps which incorporates perceptual features. Error measures that are independent of the rendering method have been presented that employ pre-computed object error profiles over a range of views <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> as a function of a simplification variable. Directly measuring image error by partial re-rendering a modified object-space and comparing affected image regions to cached images has also been presented <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>However, the ability to know the effect of simplification under different illumination conditions has not been available without rerendering as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Re-illuminating objects under novel lighting conditions has been pursued by Nimeroff et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and Teo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. However, lights remained fixed in location relative to the scene. Rushmeier, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> demonstrated that complex surface features (bump maps) may be obtained from three (3) measured images with varying light directions. Debevec et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> presented the re-illumination of human face images with reflection functions acquired from measurements of many views and illumination directions. Belhumeur et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> have shown that, for a given view, the sub-space of images possible under variation in lighting direction is determined by surface normal distribution of the illuminated object, and that three (3) images are sufficient to form a basis for diffuse lighting.</p><p>Our method for computing re-illuminated image properties employs sample synthetic images and techniques as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. However, we address the relocation of directional light sources as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> rather than re-direction of a fixed light. The problem associated with the max function in normal Lambertian shading is removed by use of an alternative shading function, specifically hemispherical shading, presented by Nishita and Eihachiro <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> to render objects under outdoor illumination. The re-lighting work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> and Fourier-slice volume rendering <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> have employed hemispherical shading to account for visibility. Use of a such linear shading allows linear transforms, employed in visual perception metrics, to be calculated as a pre-process independent of illumination. Also, if image regions are known to receive ambient illumina-tion only, rendering costs may be reduced in the corresponding object space. To increase the similarity of hemispherical shaded objects to Lambertian shading, we apply gamma correction <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> followed by intensity scaling to simulate the effect of the max function. Gamma correction is extensively employed by tone reproduction systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> to increase visibility in poorly lit regions, simulating the adaptation of the eye. However, we propose to use gamma correction to reduce the visibility of surfaces in poorly lit image areas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">VISIBILITY AND REFLECTANCE</head><p>In real images, surfaces which are obstructed from the view of a light source are not illuminated, and thus neither diffuse nor specular reflection is possible. In the absence of ambient light, the surface would have zero radiance in the image. In image synthesis, the amount of light reflected from a surface is usually computed from the surface normal vector, view and light direction vectors, and a surface reflection function. While reflection functions can be complex, Lambertian reflectance is often used to compute surface shading. The scalar product employed in Lambertian reflectance is linear but does not account for the light and surface visibility, resulting in negative radiance values. To account for visibility, image synthesis employs the max operator so that all negative radiance values are set to zero. However, the nonlinear max function prevents the expression of Lambertian shading in linear form.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Linear Reflectance</head><p>One of our primary interests in this work is to develop computations of lighting-dependent image properties without rendering the object space. To be useful for applications such as LOD selection, these computations will also involve linear transformations, such as the Fourier or wavelet transforms. If the linear form of Lambertian reflectance, without the max function, is employed, pre-computed values can be calculated. However, negative radiance will result in values that deviate significantly from real imagery. To overcome this, we employ a function inspired by hemispherical reflection, which has been used to simulate outside lighting under natural sky conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Our adaptation of hemispherical reflection is shown in Equation 1. With this formulation of reflection the resulting image is given by: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where N.w refers to the dot-product of N and w, and:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E(u,v) is the image E sampled at image coordinates (u,v) k d</formula><p>is the Lambertian reflectivity coefficient for the object space surface mapped to the sample <ref type="bibr">(u,v)</ref> N is the corresponding surface normal of the object space surface L is light intensity arriving from direction w.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>If we express w and N in terms of the Euclidean basis:</head><p>then Equation 1 can be expressed as: </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">E u v , ( ) Lk d 2 --------1 N + .w ( ) = w w x x w y ŷ w z ẑ + + = N n x x n</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Sample Image Basis</head><p>Equation 2 is a linear formula for creating an image using hemispherical shading, given a light vector and per-pixel reflection coefficients and surface normals. The latter two parameters may be removed by use of four (4) sample images, rendered from known lighting directions, and used to solve for the (k d N xyz ) matrix. These images form a basis for the view such that an arbitrary light vector can be incorporated by summing the images with suitable weights. As shown below, the weights can be found using only the arbitrary vector and the light vectors employed to create each basis image. Equation 2 could be formulated with three (3) sample images if per-pixel reflection coefficients were subtracted before processing. However, this would also require knowledge of per-pixel diffuse reflection coefficients. Simply using an additional image eliminates the necessity to obtaining reflection coefficients, and produces a square matrix so that the pesudo-inverse is not required.</p><p>To develop an image basis, we first writing Equation 2 for four (4) sample image row vectors:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(3)</formula><p>Here w ij refers to the component j of the illuminant direction i. The matrix of (k d ) and (k d N xyz ) elements can then be solved for by inverting the matrix of sample lighting directions M defined in Equation 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(4)</head><p>This is then substituted into Equation 2 to yield a linear equation, given by Equation 5, for an image produced with an arbitrary illuminant direction. Note that the factor cancels since the sample images themselves incorporate this factor. Also, the column vector of ones (1) in M does not produce a singular matrix since all rows and columns are still linearly independent, assuming independent w i . A set of four (4) independent light vectors will produce a square matrix which may be inverted giving:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(5)</formula><p>Equation 5 may be written in the form: <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> where c k is the k th element of the row vector . This form illustrates Equation 5 as an expansion of an image with arbitrary illuminant direction on the sample images as a basis, and weighting coefficients determined solely from the sample image illuminant directions and the arbitrary illuminant direction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">APPROXIMATING LAMBERTIAN SHADING</head><p>If hemispherical shading is to be used to produce images for estimating illumination before rendering, the degree of pixel error must be understood and if possible reduced. The goal of such an operation is to depress pixel values that are in the range of (0,1], corresponding to the negative range of pixels in normal diffuse shading. Also, pixels in the range <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, corresponding to allowed positive diffuse values, should be impacted as little as possible. An additional requirement, necessary to what follows, is that the resulting image also be in the form of a projection onto a basis set of images, as in Equation 6. Ideally, a linear operator may be defined, so that operations performed on the four (4) images could be linearly combined.</p><p>The method we propose produces a vector space by multiplication such that the combination is still linear, however the number of basis vectors in this product space is higher than in the original vector space. Consider the curves presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>. The input pixel range, representing the results of shading, is shown on the abscissa. The output display range is shown on the ordinate axis and represents a mapping of (possibly modified) input pixels to normalized display values by scaling the range of input value from zero (0) to one <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Note that the input range is labeled with two (2) axis scales, where (1+N.L)/2 corresponds to hemispherical shading and N.L to normal diffuse shading. These two input ranges encompass the possible outcomes of their respective shading functions. The dynamic range for both is two (2), though one extends from -1 to 1 and the other from 0 to 2. The output mapping of hemispherical and parallel diffuse shading curves is labeled by the same notation with the exception that the max operator has been applied in normal diffuse shading. The curve labeled (1+N.L) 3 /8 is a correction applied to increase the similarity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">of 1+N.L shading to max(N.L,0)</ref>, and error is the difference between max <ref type="figure">(N.L,0)</ref> and (1+N.L) 3 /8. Other functions, such as the sigmoid <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> rational polynomial with optimized parameters, may further reduce error relative to normal diffuse shading. However, it is not clear how to generate a vector space from such a function, and polynomial multiplication does generate such a space. Other suitable transformations is an area for further research.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">E u v , ( ) L 2 ---k d 1 w + x N.x w y N.ŷ w z N.ẑ + + ( ) = L 2 ---k d u v , ( ) 1 w x w y w z 1 n x u v , ( ) n y u v , ( ) n z u v , ( ) = E L 2 ---w k d ( ) k d N x ( ) k d N y ( ) k d N z ( ) = w E 1 E 2 E 3 E 4 L 2 --- 1 w 1x w 1y w 1z 1 w 2x w 2y w 2z 1 w 3x w 3y w 3z 1 w 4x w 4y w 4z k d ( ) k d N x ( ) k d N y ( ) k d N z ( ) = M 1 w 1x w 1y w 1z 1 w 2x w 2y w 2z 1 w 3x w 3y w 3z 1 w 4x w 4y w 4z = L 2 ⁄ E w M 1 - E 1 E 2 E 3 E 4 = E c k E k k 1 = 4 ∑ = w M 1 -</formula><p>The most significant feature of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> is that positive values of N.L shading correspond to values greater than or equal to one (1) with hemispherical shading. Negative values, normally removed by max(N.L,0), correspond to hemispherical shading values less than one <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. A gamma correction greater than one (1) applied to hemispherical shading can greatly reduce values corresponding to the negative Lambertian range. Hemispherical values corresponding to a positive N.L are also effected (see the error curve in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>). However, GCHS images are very similar to that obtained with Lambertian shading, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref>, and we believe can be useful for computing image quantities such as mean value and approximate LOD errors.</p><p>By using modified hemispherical shading in this way, we eliminate the necessity of the max operator for visibility, allowing a linear system in a higher dimensional vector product space, shown in Equation 7. An exponent of three (3) allows an inflection point, so that values of zero (0) and one (1) can be obtained, and can be performed by binomial expansion of the original four (4) basis images in Equation 6. Gamma correcting and scaling Equation 6 produce coefficients and basis vectors that are linear combinations of the original values. Collected terms resulting from the binomial expansion are given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> presents an example of the Stanford bunny model, simplified to 8,000 faces, rendered using normal Lambertian shading and gamma-corrected hemispherical shading. Results for rendering the same model but illuminated from a different direction are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref>. Both GCHS images were produced starting from a set of four (4) hemispherical-shaded images, obtained with ray-casting, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 7(a)</ref>, where E i refers to image vectors in Equation 6. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 7</ref>(b) presents the GCHS basis images using an exponent of three (3). These images correspond to the V vector elements shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, where the twenty <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> image vectors run from top to bottom, left to right. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> is a plot of the light vector weighting coefficients A i, defined in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, obtained for <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(b) and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref>(b). Note that, while the sum of all coefficients is 1.0, the magnitude of coefficients for images under arbitrary illumination can vary significantly. We believe that this is explained by the degree to which the arbitrary image differs from any of the basis images. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref> is darker than any basis image so that basis images will have positive and negative values of similar amplitude. When large portions are bright as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, fewer basis images have significant coefficients, with larger values for the remaining coefficients. The magnitude of arbitrary light vector coefficients is most likely a function of the lighting vectors selected to produce the basis images.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Intensity Estimation</head><p>The use of pre-computed pixel means of basis images allows the relative image intensity to be computed, given the illuminant direction, without re-rendering. Global basis image means may be employed to estimate global direct illuminations. However, for use as a simple example of mesh simplification, the image is tiled with 16 by 16 pixel windows and intensity mean values computed for each window using the basis images.</p><p>Before rendering, the mean value of each window is computed with GCHS and taken as an indication of the local illumination on the faces falling within the given window. We heuristically selected a threshold of thirty (30) for a minimum acceptable value and allowed simplification within windows below this value. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 5</ref> illustrates this application. The bunny model shown in (a), rendered with an arbitrary lighting direction, was segmented into windows and mean values computed using Equation 7 with the same light direction. The original mesh, shown in (b) was then simplified to that in (c) using the Qslim quadric error software <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Mesh faces within windows with low predicted illumination (&lt; 30 ) were allowed to be simplified under the assumption that low predicted illumination indicated the absence of internal contract. Other quantities, such as the intensity variance, can also be calculated without rendering and may be useful for estimating local properties such as contrast masking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">LOD Error Estimation</head><p>An additional example illustrates the usefulness of approximate shading when computing potential perceptual image error, such as with LOD approximations. We make use of frequency space image metrics, as presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, which involves the computation of Fourier coefficients and image power spectra. Using approximate shading, these coefficients can be found for an arbitrary illuminant direction using transforms of the vector space basis images. Let E' represent the hemispherical image after the gamma correction as shown in Equation 7. The Fourier series of the image E' can now be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(8)</formula><p>The Fourier series of a difference image formed between E' images, produced with high and low-resolution models, can now be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(9)</formula><p>The signal power in the difference image can be written in terms of the real and imaginary components in Equation 9. We may compute the difference image power ∆P L for an arbitrary illuminant image at frequency (u,v) as a function of the basis image coefficients: <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> Here W L = ∆R∆R T + ∆I∆I T is a real matrix and is a function of frequency only. Thus ∆P L (u,v) is obtained by transforming the W L matrix at image frequencies with the coefficient vector A. Note, however, that W L is not a function of illuminant direction. This is embodied solely in the vector A. Therefore, W L may be computed once (per object view) and transformed by A during rendering to produce error values for an arbitrary illuminant direction.</p><p>The size of W L (u,v) is in general too large to maintain for every view and LOD in a discrete error profile. If image error is defined as the normalized, frequency space mean square error, which is summed over the extent of the image frequency space, overhead is reduced to a matrix for a given view. Even this can be reduced since W is symmetric. For computation, individual components of W may be computed from R and I, which requires only 40 terms per LOD for each view. Note also that the high-resolution matrix W H does not change with LOD and thus must be computed only once for each view irrespective of the number of LOD models. The difference between high-resolution and low-resolution terms in W L may also be pre-calculated for each view and LOD model.

As in earlier perceptual error metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the difference in magnitude of signal power obtained from images of high and low resolution object models is computed using the Fourier series. We have now developed the metric in terms of the Fourier coefficients of basis images, and a vector A that is a function of illuminant direction only. The error can then be computed for an arbitrary illuminant vector using the basis image transforms, M -1 , and the given light direction vector. To incorporate perceptual effects, we employ the CSF to apply visual contrast and spatial frequency threshold levels of the human cortex. Mannos and Sakrison <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, who measured the CSF by conducting a series of psycho-physical experiments on human subjects, expressed their results in Equation 11:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(11)</formula><p>where f s is angular spatial frequency in cycles per degree corresponding to rectangular image frequency <ref type="bibr">(u,v)</ref>. Equation 11 can now be applied to Equation 10 so that the difference image power will be modulated by the visual system's frequency response: <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> where S corresponds to the difference matrix W(u,v) multiplied by the CSF at the angular frequency corresponding to (u,v). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 6</ref> presents error values for images produced with LOD mountains generated from an elevation height field. The x axis values are LOD model index number, with zero (0) corresponding to 1,000 faces and seven (7) to 8,000 faces, in steps of 1,000. Light vector numbers, given on the y axis, refer to 6 randomly computed light vectors. Individual light vector error curves were normalized to the corresponding high-resolution model's image signal power, as in Equation 12. For <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 6</ref> these were then normalized to the maximum value for all LODs and light vectors. Images for the full 8,000 face resolution illuminated with light vectors 0, 2, and 5 are show in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 6</ref>(a) was computed using normal max(N.L,0) reflection and direct Fourier analysis. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 6</ref>(b) was computed using our GCHS matrix formulation without multiplication by the CSF. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 6</ref>(c) is the same calculation but including the CSF multiplication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">LOD Error Estimation with GCHS</head><p>Note that errors for LOD values are all large for coarse LOD models and approach zero (0) as the model approaches the reference model's complexity. However, highest errors occur for light vectors which provide relatively little illumination. This can be explained by noting that the difference image signal power is divided by that obtained for the high-resolution model with the same light vector. Therefore, the smaller total value of signal power tends to amplify image differences. The luminance adaptation mechanism of the vision system does produce increased sensitivity at lower intensity levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. However, extremely low image intensity can result in low sensitivity to LOD differences, indicating that some other image quantity, such as mean intensity estimation, may also be employed to provide a more robust error metric. Note too that use of the CSF tends to compress the overall range of error. Error at lower LOD is increased but declines more sharply as LOD complexity rises as compared to non-CSF GCHS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">REDUCING BASIS SIZE</head><p>One drawback of a linear basis shading formulation is that a large number of terms can result, such as twenty <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> terms from the cubic gamma correction. Because the number of polynomial terms increases as O(n 3 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, a larger gamma exponent will result in large basis sets and even large error matrices. Reducing the number of basis is desirable if an acceptable error can be maintained. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> we have employed a singular value decomposition (SVD) projection of our GCHS basis onto a lower dimensional vector subspace. As before let V denote the cubic polynomial basis images obtained with GCHS. Employing the inverse SVD, we can express V as: <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> where P k and Q k are the k th row and column vectors respectively from the left and right singular vector matrices, and s k is the k th singular value. N is the number of images in the full basis and M is some number less than or equal to N. When M&lt;N, an approximation to V is computed. However, if all but a few singular values are small remaining terms may be dropped. Therefore, calculations involving the matrix product of A and V can be replaced by: <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> where q k = AQ k . In our results, we have found that the amount of error introduced is a function of the lighting vector A, with five <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> or fewer terms adequate to keep total pixel error below 1% for some light vectors. This can become as high as 20% for others. The error is most evident as negative pixel values and is greatest for images that are primarily back lighted, resulting in very little contrast within the object. Lowest errors are seen in images such as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(b) which contain significant contrast.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">C f s ( ) 2.6 0.0192 0.114f s + [ ] 0.114f s ( ) 1.1 - [ ] exp ( ) = e ∆P L u v , ( )C f s ( ) v ∑ u ∑ P H u v , ( )C f s ( ) v ∑ u ∑ -------------------------------------------------------- A S L u v , ( ) v ∑ u ∑ A T A S H u v , ( ) v</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We have presented a technique to address the estimation of synthetic image properties without rendering the image. The hemispherical reflectance function was described and the GCHS method presented to simulate max operations. A linear system was then developed to produce newly-illuminated views using precomputed sample images. The key feature is that the weights for the basis images are derived solely from lighting direction. Two example applications were then presented. The first was an estimation of local image intensity, as a function of light direction, to determine model faces suitable for more aggressive simplification. The second presented an adaptation of an existing error metric to include variations due to illuminant direction.</p><p>Several areas of future work have been identified to expand the usefulness of this method. Incorporating specular reflections may be possible with higher gamma exponents, similar to Phong shading. Also, use of other linear transforms, such as the wavelet transform, may be beneficial to better simulate visual perception. Finally, since LOD image error estimation does not depend on the image synthesis method, this technique is useful for rendering algorithms which do not employ explicit connectivity, such as point or surface rendering. A useful compromise between reducing the basis size and allowable error can be obtained, we believe, as LOD comparisons are performed for images illuminated under identical conditions. Optimizing this approach will be an area of further research. </p><formula xml:id="formula_11">V 1 -V 20 E 1 E 2 E 3 E 4</formula><p>Permission to publish this paper was granted by the Director, Geotechnical and Structures Laboratory, U.S. Army ERDC. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>(a) Normal diffuse shading.
