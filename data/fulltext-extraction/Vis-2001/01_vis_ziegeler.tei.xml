			<abstract>
				<p>Traditional methods for displaying weather products are generally two-dimensional (2D) plots or just text format. It is hard for forecasters to get the entire picture of the atmosphere using these methods. The problems apparent in 2D with comparing and correlating multiple layers are overcome simply by adding a dimension. This is important because pertinent features in the data sets may lie in multiple layers and span several time steps. However, simply using a three-dimensional (3D) approach is not enough. The capacity for analysis of small-scale, but important, features in 2D is lost when transitioning to 3D. We propose that 3D&apos;s advantages can be incorporated with 2D&apos;s small-scale analysis by using an immersive virtual environment. In this case study, we evaluate our current standing with the project: have we met our goals, and how should we proceed from this point? To evaluate our application, we invited meteorologists to use the application to explore a data set. Then we presented our goals and asked which ones had we met, from a meteorologist&apos;s perspective. The results qualitatively reflected that our application was effective and further research would be worthwhile.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In meteorology, visualization may be applied in both an analytic and diagnostic manner towards the prediction of atmospheric behavior and phenomena. Meteorology visualizations have evolved from static two-dimensional overlays to time-lapse series with imposed (or implied) three-dimensional features. However, to fully realize the benefits of atmospheric modeling and to better understand the physical processes in the atmosphere, an immersive visual environment could prove valuable. Such a virtual environment allows direct observation (for comparison with observed data and phenomena) and an assessment of model parameterization (compared to real physical processes). These provide for improved understanding, analysis, and prediction of storm systems and their behavior as well as for discrete knowledge of their inherent features.</p><p>As electronic technology improves and computational power increases, collected and generated data sets are growing larger and more complicated. Data sets contain several vertical layers, multiple time steps, and multiple variables. These data sets are growing in size and resolution to provide information that covers larger geographic areas with greater accuracy as is the case with mesoscale models in atmospheric science. Data sets such as these present new challenges for scientific visualization.</p><p>We propose that a virtual environment, with the appropriate virtual interfaces and visualization techniques, could improve experts' interpretations of atmospheric data. The resulting meteorological products would be enhanced, and decision makers would be provided with additional perspective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">PROBLEM 2.1 Data</head><p>Although our case study would apply to any atmospheric data, our research involves data sets generated by regional mesoscale models. These tend to be highly specialized and specific data for a large number of grid points in a three-dimensional depiction of the atmosphere. For each of these points a variety of equations are solved for short timesteps. The data used herein was generated by version 3 of the fifthgeneration Mesoscale Model (MM5). MM5 is a regional-scale primitive equation model that can be configured hydrostatically or non-hydrostatically <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. It uses a terrain-following coordinate in pressure and solves its finite differential equations with a timesplit scheme using the leapfrog operator. Multiple, moving, overlapping nesting capability exists with two-way interactivity. The boundary-layer physics include a simple bulk aerodynamic parameterization or a more detailed scheme: Blackadar's planetary boundary layer model (PBL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The atmospheric radiation option presents long-wave and short-wave schemes that interact with the atmosphere, including cloud and precipitation fields as well as with the surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. It has Polar-stereographic, Lambert conformal, and Mercator projection options. MM5 permits any number of vertical levels to be used. In this study, the nonhydrostatic option, Blackadar's PBL model, and Lambert conformal projection were utilized. The model was run on triplenested domains centered at Jackson, Mississippi with an outer domain grid spacing of 27km, and inner grids of 9 and 3 km respectively.</p><p>The Kain-Fritsch convective parameterization scheme was used in the outer domain while an explicit moisture scheme that includes prognostic equations for cloud-water, ice, rainwater, and snow were employed on the two finer domains.</p><p>MM5 data files average about 30 to 40 data variables. The format classifies each data field by dimension, ordering, and other attributes. Fields of dimension 2 are variables computed at the surface or some plane perpendicular to the surface. Fields of dimension 3 span all layers of the entire grid. Ordering allows the format to specify special orderings of the data within each variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Traditional 2D Visualization</head><p>Most of the visualization involving MM5 in the past has been 2D. This 2D visualization of multi-layer, time-series data makes it difficult to see all layers and time steps in a single image. Animation is the most obvious solution to visualizing the timeseries aspect of the data. However, we still have the problem that inherently three-dimensional (3D) data, which captures the essence of atmospheric behavior, is being reduced to 2D. To be able to analyze phenomena that span several layers, one would have to imagine each image superimposed over the other. This could be a difficult task for many layers. The task would be further complicated with time-series data.</p><p>Another inherent problem with 2D visualization is displaying multi-variable data. Each layer in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows two variables simultaneously, one with vector glyphs and another with isolines. It is already cluttered with information, but it is still feasible to show a third variable using a color-mapped surface (chloropleths). Showing more than three variables without the variables occluding each other is difficult, if not impossible, even with transparent and fade-in/out software programs. The only other option, if we want to continue using 2D, is to add more images. Of course, this presents the same problem present with multiple layers: it is difficult to compare multiple variables. Two widely used 2D meteorological visualization applications are GRADS <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and NCAR Graphics <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Traditional 3D Visualization</head><p>Using 3D visualization and animation, we can easily view multilayer, time-series data sets in a unified manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. Interactive 3D visualization exploits the mind's ability to grasp complex environments. For example, instability of atmosphere is crucial for the development of storms. The stability of the atmosphere is dependent upon vertical structure. Tabular outputs and plotting tools can be used to view vertical structure, but 3D visualization techniques can provide a visual understanding of vertical structure in any part of the domain. In addition, if the data are time sequenced, the analyst can determine how the vertical structure of data varies over time, location, or any combination of location and time. In fact, atmospheric motions and behaviors require analysis in a true continuum to identify heat, moisture, and mass fluxes and exchanges properly and adequately. This is critical given the general non-linearity of atmospheric processes and their crossscale impacts and feedbacks. To the operational user (and forecaster) they provide physical insight -and true visualizationof what the atmosphere is "doing" in a visible manner. Such information is extremely valuable to the user who requires sensible evidence and interpretations for decision-making.</p><p>3D visualization does share a common problem with 2D: a limit on the number simultaneous variables that can be displayed. This limit is arguably higher in 3D; however, with high-resolution multi-variable data sets, the visualizations can get cluttered and nearly unreadable very quickly.</p><p>Finally, we claim that traditional "desktop 3D" visualization loses an important feature of 2D: the ability to closely examine smallscale, but important, phenomena within the data set. This is an easy task in 2D. We simply zoom in to the area of an image in which we are interested. If we were to zoom into the center of an image, for example, the surrounding data would not occlude our view of that area. Also, if we wanted to compare that area to another area, zooming out and panning around the image is easy. However, with desktop 3D, we are generally viewing a volume of data from outside the volume. Although, it is possible to implement 3D navigation such that the user is placed inside the data, it is still difficult for the user to analyze the data as if inside the data set <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The challenge is to visualize multi-layer, multivariable, time-series data sets in such a way that we can take advantage of 3D techniques without losing the 2D techniques' valuable capacity for small-scale analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">PROCEDURES 3.1 Data Format</head><p>Due to its grid structure, data ordering, and P-sigma vertical configuration, MM5 output data format is unique compared to other weather forecast numerical models. Since we want a visualization system that will be flexible and adaptable to new formats, the MM5 output data are too specific to be a generic format. Attempting to directly visualize data from the MM5 data format would create complicated visualization algorithms, since they would have to be designed to handle the different types of data fields. Our solution is to convert the MM5 data to some other format more compatible with multiple formats. We call our format MetArray.</p><p>The first issue is grid format. We cannot assume that there is any regular spacing on the x and y axes, since all of the points are given explicitly. Sigma values give no indication of the pressure or height of the data points without the user having to perform calculations. Nor do they give any indication of the spacing between the individual layers. We at least need to convert the sigma layers to pressure surfaces. Using pressure surfaces is one option for visualization; however, it is also possible to transform pressure into a reference height. With the height values calculated for every point, we have an explicit (i, j, k) coordinate for every grid point. These are stored in a height grid file. Also, a pressure data field now exists, which we store in a separate file. This will be important when users of the system would like to query or view the pressure values.</p><p>Another issue is wind vector data. MM5 stores each component of the wind (U, V, and W) as a separate data field. Since a user may like to visualize wind using vector glyphs, streamlines, etc., we combine the data fields into a single, three-component wind data field. Before we do this, however, we must interpolate the W (vertical) data field to our standard sigma layers, since it is calculated on layers halfway between each standard sigma layer.</p><p>Each variable is written to its own file, with every time step included within that file. After all data fields are written to files, a MetArray file is written, containing all of the information necessary to read the data fields (the dimensions of the grid, the number of time steps, the number of variables, file names, etc.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Visualization Prototyping</head><p>To ensure that our conversions are correct, and to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of 3D visualization, we implemented a prototype visualization application. The application is designed to use a combination of traditional 3D visualization tools (isosurfaces, vector glyphs, direct volume rendering, etc.) and some new tools that we developed. First we construct a terrain surface. By default, it has a brown to tan ramped color map based on height if no data is applied. However, since many of the variables in the data set are 2D surface variables, we allow the option to color map the surface based on any 2D data field. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 2 and 3</ref> show the terrain color mapped with rainfall. For further context information, we superimpose county vectors for the state of Mississippi over the terrain for the innermost domain.</p><p>Next we assign typical 3D visualization tools to certain variables in a manner that we think would be most intuitive. We use white isosurfaces of very low threshold to show cloud density. Looking at the 3D views of the data set, the isosurfaces appear as clouds, which is the intention. We use direct volume rendering (DVR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> to display appropriate 3D variables. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, we use DVR to visualize temperature.</p><p>Finally, we developed our own technique for visualizing specific types of variables. The MM5 data sets contain several types of mixing ratio variables. These variables define the mass of a precipitation or moisture type per mass of air at a specific grid point. Examples include moisture, cloud-water, rainwater, snow, and ice mixing ratios. We have already used isosurfaces for cloud-water mixing ratio, and DVR is very difficult to implement if we want to simultaneously visualize multiple mixing ratio variables.</p><p>Our alternative technique involves placing small particles in grid points with relatively higher values. The user may set the maximum number of particles per grid point. Based on the maximum, the number of particles is linearly interpolated from the data value. The respective numbers of particles are randomly scattered near the grid point.</p><p>We call this new tool a particle density field. For a variable such as snow mixing ratio, these particles would appear intuitively as "snow flakes." An additional advantage to this technique is that we may display other variables and simply change the color of the particles. For example, if we made our snow particles white, and then added blue particles for ice mixing ratio, the two should display well simultaneously. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> illustrates this exact situation. The same configuration is also used in Figures 4 and 5.</p><p>We used Open Visualization Data Explorer (OpenDX) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to implement our 3D application to avoid re-creating computational algorithms and graphics routines. Its data model is more adaptable than most software and easily lent itself to our MetArray format.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Implementing Immersion</head><p>We successfully fused multiple layers, time steps, and variables using 3D visualization. However, we want to combine 3D's ability to provide the "big picture," yet maintain 2D's analysis advantages. Our solution is to implement an immersive virtual environment (VE). Besides our primary goal, there are additional advantages to applying VE technology to meteorological visualization:</p><p>• Improved human-computer interaction <ref type="bibr">[</ref> Wider field-of-view <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> When implementing a meteorological VE, we want to follow the same methodology that we used when designing our 3D visualization application. This implies that we utilize the same or similar visualization tools. However, we also want to address issues specific to VE's, and we want our final application to be more user oriented. Our 3D application was designed for a few data sets with some tools hardwired to the variables. It was only necessary to serve as proof of concept. The VE should allow the user to decide which visualization tools are appropriate for any given variables.</p><p>In following our methodology, we implement the terrain surface in a similar manner as our 3D application. Any 2D variable may be used to color map the surface. Isosurfaces are implemented using the marching cubes algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and may be used for any 3D variable. We diverge somewhat from our 3D application in that we did not implement DVR. Instead, we simply place points at every n th grid point (where n is defined by the user) and color these points based on the data value.</p><p>DVR can be computationally expensive, and interactive frame rates must be maintained in order for the VE to be useful. Finally, we implement the particle density field for visualizing 3D mixing ratio variables. The user does, however, have the option to visualize other 3D variables using this tool. We call our resulting immersive application MetVR.</p><p>MetVR is designed to run in a CAVE. This is a spatially immersive environment consisting of multiple walls (varying from 2 to 6) that surround the user. The application itself is built upon the VR Juggler <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> libraries with OpenGL as the graphics API. We chose VR Juggler because it is open source and more portable than other competing VE libraries. VR Juggler is also written in C++, and we are using an object-oriented design strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Improvements upon Previous VE's</head><p>Both Cave5D <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and vGeo <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> can cache data on disk, but MetVR is optimized for multi-variable, time-series data sets. Thus it streams in the data as needed. MetVR is faster and more flexible. We also feel that the visuals are much richer. Finally, MetVR is free and user extendible. To use vGeo, one must purchase both the CaveLibs and vGeo itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">RESULTS</head><p>With MetVR at a usable phase in its development, we could compare its effectiveness with traditional 2D and 3D applications. The evaluation involved meteorologists testing the application in the CAVE to determine its effectiveness and usefulness.</p><p>The evaluators had considerable experience using GRADS for 2D visualization and Vis5D for 3D visualization. We allowed them to explore the data set and noted any comments and questions. When the users were finished evaluating, we showed them our list of primary goals as shown in section 3.3 and asked if they thought we had met those goals. For unmet goals, we asked if they had any suggestions for improvements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Small-Scale Analysis</head><p>With their experience in traditional 2D and 3D visualization, the users did indeed find that small-scale features were easier to see and analyze in the VE. They could identify regions of interest from a distance, and then simply navigate to the area for further inspection. One specific advantage that a user noted was that the VE shows the tops and bottoms of cloud layers when he navigated to a specific region. This is an important feature in storm analysis since the location and shape of clouds indicate if a storm is or will be present (i.e. low altitude, thin clouds usually mean a storm).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Additional Advantages</head><p>The users found the navigation more natural than with a desktop system. They could simply point to the location with a wand and press a button to fly there. The users thought that they could easily complete common analysis tasks using the given interface.</p><p>As expected, the users found that immersion in the meteorological data in the CAVE was an excellent metaphor for actual weather. They found the stereoscopy to be very useful in discriminating between near and distant features -a much more difficult task in Vis5D. Also, the wider field-of-view allowed them to see more data simultaneously.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>With our 3D approach, we were able to introduce some visualization techniques that are not commonly used tools in meteorology.</p><p>We combined these tools with the more conventional methods. Finally, using an immersive VE, we were able to combine 3D's greater ability for multi-layer analysis with 2D's capacity for small-scale analysis. We could qualitatively identify how our immersive VE achieved this goal. We believe that such an advantage, in addition to the other listed advantages in using immersion, could lead to improved interpretation of meteorological data. Such an improvement would bring about better weather related products and increased capability in decision-making. Our conclusion from this study is that a VE could be properly tailored for atmospheric analysis, and further development of such a VE would be valuable.</p><p>For future work, we plan to do a comprehensive study comparing the abilities to see small-scale features so that we can quantify the improvements gained by immersion. We also plan to implement improvements to MetVR based on users' recommendations. To help indicate the user's location within the dataset, we will add a "you-are-here" overview map with an icon indicating the user's location inside the dataset.</p><p>For the particle density fields, spheres instead of points may be desirable. However, this is unrealistic, considering the rendering time necessary to render the required number of spheres. Instead we propose using a single bill boarded polygon and texture mapping the polygon with the image of a sphere. Additional features will include new tools and enhancements to tools.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>illustrates how multiple layers are usually displayed in 2D.</figDesc></figure>
