				<p>We introduce a new algorithm for fitting a Catmull-Clark subdivision surface to a given shape within a prescribed tolerance, based on the method of quasi-interpolation. The fitting algorithm is fast, local and scales well since it does not require the solution of linear systems. Its convergence rate is optimal for regular meshes and our experiments show that it behaves very well for irregular meshes. We demonstrate the power and versatility of our method with examples from interactive modeling, surface fitting, and scientific visualization.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Subdivision schemes provide efficient algorithms for the design, representation and processing of arbitrary topology smooth surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Application settings range from industrial design and animation to scientific visualization and simulation. A basic technique in any of these areas is the approximation of a desired surface with a given surface. For example, scattered data interpolation over arbitrary topology surfaces, approximation of complex isosurfaces arising in scientific visualization, or interactive freeform surface editing. In particular the latter requires fast methods which go beyond traditional control point manipulation and its sensitivity to iso-parameter line and patch boundary layout.</p><p>In this paper we introduce a new method for fitting a subdivision surface with details to a given shape. It generalizes the method of quasi-interpolation to Catmull-Clark surfaces and enables efficient approximation of a given shape to any desired accuracy. The basic idea is to use local, weighted averages of samples of the desired surface as control points. Detail coefficients (in the sense of a Laplacian pyramid construction) are computed in a coarse to fine process in the same way, and added only where the fit is not satisfactory. In particular, no solution of global linear systems with an a priori fixed set of coefficients is required <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Quasi-interpolation enjoys an optimal order of convergence away from irregular vertices, making it asymptotically as good as least-squares. Empirical tests show that our method also performs well in the non-asymptotic regime.</p><p>Quasi-interpolation is useful for many data fitting tasks, particularly when the level of detail varies over the data set. Objects such as these, indicative of geometric modeling and scientific computing applications, are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Each shape is a subdivision surface with details computed using quasi-interpolation, whose fidelity to the actual object can be controlled to any desired precision. The final representation is amenable to further manipulation by performing successive local approximations on the same surface. Note that we do not address the correspondence problem. Instead we assume that a correspondence exists, i.e., a mapping from the given surface to the desired surface, and focus on the rapid computation of appropriate, adaptively chosen detail vectors to ensure that a given error tolerance is met. In many settings such correspondences exist naturally; for example, in direct manipulation during interactive editing or in the evolution of an iso-surface in level set methods for scientific computing. In other settings establishing such mappings requires the full power of a parameterization algorithm (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Related Work</head><p>Fitting subdivision surfaces with details to existing data was the subject of work by Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> who used a subdivision surface with displacement maps (i.e., single level details) to fit scanned geometry using a costly global optimization method. Earlier, Halstead et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> described fitting of Catmull-Clark surfaces to a set of interpolation constraints. Neither approach scales well, due to the size of the linear systems and their poor conditioning, nor do they allow for local fitting. For complex fitting tasks, such as an emboss or an iso-surface extraction, this quickly becomes untenable. In contrast our approach is based on local operations. Thus there is no linear system to solve, providing both good scalability and local control.</p><p>Manipulation of subdivision surfaces in the editing setting has been studied, e.g., by Zorin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, who described hierarchical editing of Loop surfaces with details, while DeRose et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> focused on Catmull-Clark surfaces and (semi-)sharp crease rules to achieve a number of modeling effects. Both rely on control point manipulation, requiring careful layout of patch boundaries and isoparameter lines. Placing arbitrarily shaped, curve-like features on a Loop surface with details was addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> by fitting fine level control points to a given profile, but without any accuracy guarantees. Similarly, in the context of classical and hierarchical spline methods, Conrad and Mann have shown how to use quasi-interpolation for surface pasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> to achieve arbitrary placement of features in interactive editing. Unfortunately their method achieves only approximate continuity across pasting features. In contrast we extend quasi-interpolation to subdivision surfaces with details, which allows for a uniform treatment of local displacements throughout the hierarchy and guarantees globally smooth results.</p><p>The generic problem of approximation of functions by subdivision surfaces in the regular setting is a subject of study in approximation theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> where it is shown that quasiinterpolation is asymptotically as good as least squares approximation. However, in the presence of irregular vertices, optimal approximation methods are not yet known. In fact, even the optimal rate of approximation remains unknown <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Our algorithm generalizes quasi-interpolation to Catmull-Clark surfaces (we use the variant of Biermann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>) and extends earlier ideas applied in the context of trimming for Loop surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. While there is currently no approximation theory for the irregular setting we find empirically that the numerical accuracy of our method compares very favorably with least-squares solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Quasi-Interpolation</head><p>Before we review some basic facts about quasi-interpolation for surfaces, we begin with a simple univariate example to explain the difference between least-squares optimal approximation and quasiinterpolation.</p><p>An Example Consider the univariate approximation problem with uniform cubic B-splines. Given samples of a (sufficiently smooth) function f , the least-squares method computes control points for an optimal cubic spline with knots at the integers. This requires the solution of a linear system whose size is proportional to the number of knots. The approximation error can be reduced by increasing the number of knots.</p><p>Instead, the following local method can be used. Let pi be the control point at i and set</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">pi = ‚àí 1 6 f (i ‚àí 1) + 4 3 f (i) ‚àí 1 6 f (i + 1), ‚àÄi ‚àà . (1)</formula><p>This is a local operator, therefore it cannot guarantee interpolation. However, this quasi-interpolant is an exact interpolant whenever f is a cubic polynomial. When knots (and samples) are taken at denser intervals, i.e., the spacing h is decreased, the approximation error converges to zero as O(h 4 ), the same rate as for least-squares approximation. In this sense quasi-interpolation is asymptotically as good as least-squares approximation. We will see later on that it also compares very favorably in the non-asymptotic regime, i.e., for a given finite h.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Quasi-Interpolation in Shift-Invariant Spaces</head><p>A PSI (Principal Shift Invariant) space is a space spanned by the integer translates of one function <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. We restrict our attention to the case of a bivariate function Œ¶ which is continuous and compactly supported, e.g., the bicubic B-spline. The PSI space SŒ¶ is defined as the span of the integer translates of Œ¶,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">SŒ¶ = span Œ±‚àà 2 {Œ¶(‚Ä¢ ‚àí Œ±)} .</formula><p>A scale of spaces with increasing resolution is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S j Œ¶ = span Œ±‚àà 2 √í Œ¶(2 j ‚Ä¢ ‚àíŒ±) √ì = √í f (2 j ‚Ä¢) | f ‚àà SŒ¶ √ì ,</formula><p>where j denotes the level (j = 0 is coarsest). As j increases, the space S j Œ¶ captures finer scales. For subdivision surfaces, the underlying function Œ¶ is refinable, namely, it can be written as a combination of dilates and translates of itself. Therefore we have S j Œ¶ ‚äÇ S j+1 Œ¶ . We measure the approximation error in the maximum norm, f ‚àû = maxx f (x), and denote b j (f ) ‚àà S j Œ¶ as the best approximation to f from the space S j Œ¶ . It can be shown that if SŒ¶ contains all of the bivariate polynomials of degree less than m + 1, then for every function f which has m + 1 continuous and bounded derivatives, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">b j (f ) ‚àí f ‚àû = O 2 ‚àíj(m+1) , j ‚Üí ‚àû,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>and we say that the scale of spaces S j Œ¶ has approximation order m + 1. The converse is also true: in order to get approximation order m + 1, SŒ¶ has to contain all bivariate polynomials of degree less than m+1. In that sense Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">2</ref>gives an optimal error estimate.</p><p>A quasi-interpolation operator Q j is defined by a locally supported mask (a Œ≤ ) Œ≤‚àà 2, which is applied to samples of the given function <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">For j = 0, 1, . . ., Q j calculates a function in S j Œ¶ that approximates f , Q j f = Œ±‚àà 2 ¬º Œ≤‚àà 2 a Œ≤ f (2 ‚àíj (Œ≤ + Œ±)) ¬Ω Œ¶(2 j ‚Ä¢ ‚àíŒ±).</formula><p>If the mask a contains only a few non-zero elements, then Q j computes the coefficients of each basis function using a weighted average of only a small number of samples of f .</p><p>If a quasi-interpolation operator reproduces all polynomials œÄ up to and including degree m, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Q 0 œÄ = œÄ then Q j f ‚àí f ‚àû ‚â§ c2 ‚àíj(m+1) f (m+1) ‚àû Œ≤ |a Œ≤ |,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>for all functions f that have m + 1 continuous derivatives, for j = 0, 1, . . .. The constant c depends only on the support of the mask a. Thus a quasi-interpolation operator can achieve the optimal approximation order m + 1. The only condition is that Q is exact for polynomials up to the maximal degree of polynomials in the space SŒ¶. Fortunately, it is not difficult to construct such operators. Although Q j uses only samples of the function, it can be shown that Q j f converges to f not only in the maximum or l2 norms, but also in Sobolev norms, i.e., derivatives of Q j f converge to derivatives of f .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Quasi-Interpolants for Regular Meshes</head><p>For regular meshes, Catmull-Clark surfaces are exactly bicubic Bspline surfaces. The corresponding PSI space is spanned by the bicubic B-spline Œ¶ with support in [‚àí2, 2] 2 . That space contains all cubic polynomials, but not all quartics. Therefore quasiinterpolation must only be exact for cubic polynomials, m + 1 = 4, to achieve the optimal approximation order.</p><p>Quasi-interpolation stencils which are supported on the 1-ring of a given vertex are simple to derive in the regular setting. Due to symmetry we need to choose coefficients a, b, c (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2b</ref>) so that the resulting stencil produces the proper B-spline control point values for constant (p(x, y) = 1) and quadratic (p(x, y) = x 2 ) functions. Reproduction of linears and cubics will follow from symmetry. These two requirements are satisfied for all simultaneous solutions of 1 = 4a + 4b + c ‚àí1 = 12a + 6b. Arbitrarily setting a = 0, for example, results in a stencil which requires only 5 function evaluations. The minimum l1 norm solution, which results in the least constants in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">3</ref>is achieved for b = 0. However, the natural generalization of the univariate setting is given by the stencil in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2c</ref>. To see this, observe that in the univariate cubic B-spline setting (Eq. 1) we have weights</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(‚àí1/6, 8/6, ‚àí1/6) = (0, 2, 0) ‚àí (1/6, 4/6, 1/6),</formula><p>which we may write as Q = 2I ‚àí L where I is the identity and L is the limit stencil for cubic B-splines. The limit stencil for bicubic B-splines is the tensor product of the univariate limit stencil <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2a)</ref>. We can now see that <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2c</ref> is equal to 2I ‚àí L. Even though its l1 norm is not minimal we prefer it since it has an obvious generalization to the irregular setting (see below).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">A Heuristic for Irregular Meshes</head><p>Since there is no approximation theory for subdivision schemes on irregular meshes, we tried different heuristics to extend quasiinterpolation to irregular vertices. For all the masks we tried, we found increased approximation error near the irregular vertices. This comes as no surprise since Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces cannot even reproduce all quadratic functions at the irregular vertices. With all trials yielding similar results, we chose a heuristic that is simple to implement. Consider the quasi-interpolation operator in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2c</ref> which can be written as twice the identity minus the limit mask</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Q = 2I ‚àí L.<label>(4)</label></formula><p>This formula carries over to the irregular setting, including common feature rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, in a straightforward fashion. The identity (I) for a given vertex in the control mesh is the stencil with 1 at the given vertex and 0 at all other vertices. Limit stencils (L) are known for all popular rules such as creases, boundaries, etc. (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). Together they define Q as above everywhere in a control mesh with regular control points leading to the standard stencil <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2c)</ref>. To see why our quasi-interpolant in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">4</ref>is a reasonable choice, it is helpful to consider the approximation problem from a different point of view. Given a control mesh that samples the target surface ‚Ñ¶ at points œâi ‚àà ‚Ñ¶ ‚äÇ √ä 3 , the usual interpolation problem is to findp such thatœâ = Lp. The vectorsœâ andp hold the samples œâi and the control points pi of the control mesh, respectively, while L contains the limit operators for each of the control points. Ignoring questions of rank for the moment, the interpolation problem may be solved asp = L ‚àí1œâ . In general, L ‚àí1 is dense, making this approach expensive. However, we can find an approximate solution for L ‚àí1 as follows. Since L = I ‚àí (I ‚àí L) and I ‚àí L &lt; 1, the use of a Neumann series gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">L ‚àí1 = ‚àû i=0 (I ‚àí L) i = I + (I ‚àí L) + (I ‚àí L) 2 + . . .</formula><p>Using only the first two terms we find</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">L ‚àí1 ‚âà 2I ‚àí L.</formula><p>Hence Q as defined in Equation (4) amounts to a "first order approximation" of the inverse of the limit operator L. This provides some theoretical insight into the good performance of our quasiinterpolant in the irregular setting that is seen in our experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The Surface Fitting Algorithm</head><p>The input to the fitting algorithm consists of a subdivision surface sin with detail coefficients and the target surface which is given as a function œÜ : sin ‚Üí √ä 3 mapping every point on sin to a new point in space. œÜ differs from the identity only in the local area of the surface that is being fitted. The user also prescribes a collection of mesh faces, A, that designate areas of the surface not to be modified. A tolerance on the distance between the target surface and the approximation must also be provided <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</p><p>We use Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces with detail coefficients</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">p j+1 = Sp j + d j+1 , j = 0, 1, . . . ,</formula><p>where S is the subdivision operator, p j are the control points of the mesh at level j, and  <ref type="figure">(s(v)</ref>). Thus s and œÜ define a correspondence between every vertex of the mesh at any level, and some point on the target surface. The correspondence determines how the target surface is sampled at the vertices, and therefore directly affects the approximation error, which we control by adaptively subdividing to increase the sampling density where necessary. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows the correspondence for a simple curve and a uniform cubic B-spline as it is alternately fitted to the curve and subdivided. The quasi-interpolation operator (Eq. 4) can be applied to samples of the function, but we have observed smaller approximation errors when applying it to the difference, œÜ(s) ‚àí s. We emphasize that the smaller approximation errors are an empirical observation and we are not aware of any theoretical justification. One nice side effect of this approach is that it ensures zero details if the surface already approximates the desired function, i.e., an interpolating solution remains unchanged under this modified approach.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">d</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Adaptive Approximation</head><p>The adaptive approximation algorithm creates a sequence of surfaces s j for j = 0, 1, . . . , k that approach the target surface œÜ(sin) starting from sin and stopping at level k when s k satisfies the approximation requirements. All of the surfaces have the same control mesh as sin. The algorithm is initialized at level zero as follows:</p><p>1. Let V 0 be the collection of vertices at level 0 that do not influence the limit surface at any patch in A. Let B 0 denote the complement of A.</p><p>2. Set s 0 := sin + Q 0 (œÜ(sin) ‚àí sin), i.e., for every vertex</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">v in V 0 , p 0 (v) = p 0 (v) + Q 0 (œÜ(sin) ‚àí sin)(v).</formula><p>For j = 0, 1, . . . do 1. Let C j be the set of patches influenced by any v ‚àà V j and let B j+1 := ‚àÖ.</p><p>2. For any patch in C j ‚à™ B j which fails the approximation criterion, add its children to B j+1 and stop if B j+1 = ‚àÖ.</p><p>3. Let V j+1 be the vertices at level j + 1 that influence at least one patch in B j+1 but none in A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Set s j+1</head><formula xml:id="formula_13">:= s j + Q j+1 (œÜ(sin) ‚àí s j ), i.e., for every vertex v in V j+1 , d j+1 (v) = Q j+1 (œÜ(sin) ‚àí s j )(v).</formula><p>The termination of the algorithm is controlled by the approximation criterion. However, the basic structure of the algorithm is independent of the particular design of the criterion. For our examples, we sample the error over the given patch at a discrete set of points, taken at vertices of its subpatches. The approximation is deemed satisfactory when the error is within the provided tolerance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Comparison of Least-Squares and Quasi-Interpolation</head><p>Quasi-interpolation is optimal in the asymptotic sense in the regular setting. However, a single level of quasi-interpolation does not give a best approximation in any of the norms that are typically of interest. To test the performance of quasi-interpolation we compared it with a best approximation in the least-squares norm: given some sin and a function œÜ, we calculated s l and sq by least-squares and quasi-interpolation respectively. The least-squares norm is approximated discretely at level 2 vertices as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">E(s) = s ‚àí œÜ(sin) 2 = ¬º v‚ààV 2 |s(v) ‚àí œÜ(sin(v))| 2 /n ¬Ω 1/2</formula><p>where n is the number of vertices. s l is defined as the minimizer of E, while sq = sin + Q 0 (œÜ(sin) ‚àí sin) .</p><p>We repeat the experiment at increasingly finer resolutions, using sq from the previous level as sin for quasi-interpolation at the next finer resolution. For s l no initial surface is needed. The results of our experiments are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> for a set of functions z = f (x, y), (x, y) ‚àà [‚àí1, 1] 2 , chosen to examine the behavior of the approximation under a variety of conditions: a smooth function with decay at infinity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4a)</ref>; a smooth function with oscillations <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4b)</ref>; a function with a C 1 discontinuity at the origin <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4c)</ref>; and a function with a C 1 discontinuity along a curve <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4d)</ref>. A regular grid with 10 divisions on [‚àí1, 1] 2 served as sin. Exemplary pseudo-color plots of the error are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. The error near singularities decays faster for quasiinterpolation, due to the local support of the stencil. The overall rate of decay of the error for least-squares and quasi-interpolation is the same. In the two cases of approximation to non-smooth functions, quasi-interpolation yields an error which is very close to the optimal least-squares error, demonstrating that the constants in the error bound are indeed low.</p><p>We examined the behavior of the approximation in the irregular setting for the function in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4a</ref>     The error near the irregular vertex grows as k increases. The error at the irregular vertex scales as O(h 2 ) since the surface does not reproduce all quadratics there. However, the error is dominated by the behavior away from the irregular vertex, where the surface is regular. For this reason, the error increases less rapidly for the quasi-interpolation approximation due to the local support of the stencil. This is most apparent for large values of k. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Examples</head><p>We have applied our method of fitting subdivision surfaces to surface modeling, data fitting, and scientific visualization. Statistics for the featured models are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>. All calculations were performed on an 600Mhz Intel Pentium III.  Cross-Section Editing Surfaces may be sculpted by modeling with cross-sectional curves <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 9</ref>). An initial curve is computed by taking a cross-sectional slice of the model. The user then directly manipulates the surface by shaping the curve to the desired profile. The surface is deformed in a local region around the cross-section, by blending with the profile curve using a C 2 blend function that goes to zero at a user-specified distance from the cross-section. At the cross-section the profile curve is interpolated to high precision.</p><p>All manipulations were performed interactively. Embossing Fine detail on the surface can be modeled in relief with an embossing stencil <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 10)</ref>. The stencil is provided by a bitmap that defines the height of the emboss. The surface is deformed by projecting the stencil on the surface and quasiinterpolating the associated height profile. The inset in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref> illustrates how the approximation adapts to features of varying detail. This process is performed adaptively both on the surface and in the bitmap to ensure that excessive refinement is not necessary. Contrary to visual techniques such as bump mapping, we provide a unified model for both fine and coarse geometric detail, suitable for manufacturing purposes. Data Fitting Laser scanning allows very detailed objects to be captured, but the data is typically far too complex to edit directly. By fitting a simple subdivision surface to the scanned data, the object can be manipulated much more intuitively while retaining its intricate detail. We demonstrate this approach by fitting a subdivision surface to laser scan data given as a dense triangle mesh (300k triangles; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8a</ref>). The artist first constructs an initial subdivision surface with a basic patch layout suitable for later animation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 8b</ref>). Since the data was acquired by a cylindrical scan, we used simple cylindrical coordinates for the correspondence 2 . After alignment, the system computes the detail coefficients to produce the subdivision surface in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8c</ref>. The fit is adaptive in areas with finer detail ("hotter" colors in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8d</ref>). Now the artist can manipulate the fully detailed model using the control points from the original surface <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 8e)</ref>. The fit was computed in 6 seconds, to a relative tolerance of 0.03%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific Visualization</head><p>The rapid visualization of an evolving physical system is helpful in simulation settings. Due to the fine resolution of high fidelity simulations, I/O bandwidth off of highly parallel machines is often a very constrained resource. Saving every frame of a level set simulation, for example, may not even be possible. Subsequent processing of the time-varying volume data using traditional methods, such as marching cubes iso-surface extraction followed by decimation of the meshes, to adapt to available rendering resources is awkward and expensive, both in time and storage. An alternative approach can be based on coarsely sampling an isosurface of interest, followed by hierarchical refinements where desired. Using an appropriate correspondence to sample the data, we construct a smooth surface at successively finer resolutions, subject to time and memory restrictions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> demonstrates this idea in the case of a level set simulation of two fluids of differing density mixing under gravity, shown by the interface between the fluids <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. At the coarsest level, a base mesh is constructed from 109 sample points. A na√Øve algorithm that constructs a mesh from the sample points themselves is demonstrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11a</ref>. Contrast this to the surface which we can generate based on the same sample points using quasi-interpolation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 11b)</ref>. The surface is fit at finer resolutions as more sample points are taken in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11c-d</ref>. The final surface in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11d</ref> was generated in 300ms. This example illustrates how the same data can be used to reconstruct the surface of interest with a much higher quality using quasi-interpolation rather than piecewise linear interpolation. This is especially evident at low numbers of samples. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Contributions and Outlook</head><p>We have presented an extension of quasi-interpolation (QI) to Catmull-Clark surfaces with details, and used it as the basis for a simple and effective approximation algorithm. Due to the locality of QI, the proposed approximation scheme can be used to apply local deformations to a surface at low computational cost and with a guaranteed error tolerance. To demonstrate the power of these operators we have given some examples of approximation based on them.</p><p>Since QI does not involve the solution of linear systems, it is significantly simpler and safer to use in comparison to other common techniques, such as interpolation and least-squares. We reviewed theoretical results about the optimality of QI, and added empirical evidence showing that QI behaves very well in comparison to the optimal least-squares method.</p><p>The appeal of our algorithm is its ability to generate a suitable approximation of any shape that possesses an appropriate sampling method, as demonstrated by our examples. Locality and the coarseto-fine fitting strategy enable many applications of this technique in scientific simulation and visualization, which promise to be much more efficient than traditional approaches (e.g., marching cubes extraction followed by decimation).</p><p>In the area of geometric modeling our techniques allows the efficient creation of highly detailed features such as embosses or the editing of cross-section curves without regard to alignment of patch boundaries or iso-parameter lines. In this way QI offers an opportunity to abstract from the underlying representation during editing. This should prove beneficial to geometric modeling user interfaces which aim to abstract from the underlying representation.</p><p>In future work we hope to develop a theory for optimal approximation in the irregular setting and explore other applications of QI in digital geometry processing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fitting applied to examples from scientific computing and geometric modeling.
