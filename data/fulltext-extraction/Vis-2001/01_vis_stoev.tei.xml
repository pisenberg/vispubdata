				<p>In this paper, we address the problem of historical data visualization. We describe the data acquisition, preparation, and visualization. Since the data contain four dimensions, the standard 3D exploration techniques have to be extended or appropriately adapted in order to enable interactive exploration. We discuss in detail two interaction concepts: (1) navigation with one fixed dimension, and (2) quasi 4D navigation allowing to simultaneously explore the four-dimensional space. In addition, we also present a picture-inpicture display mode, enabling the user to interactively view the data, while &quot;flying with&quot; a particular event, tracking its motion in time and space. Finally, we present a technique for guided exploration and animation generation, allowing for a vivid gain of insight into the historical data.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction and Related Work</head><p>Although we are able to visualize almost any kind of data nowadays, the visualization of historical data is still a challenging task. The problem with 3D space combined with an additional time dimension in general and with historical data in particular is the fourth dimension-the time. Conceptually, this problem is similar to the problem of visualizing particles and their motion in time. The data contain a time-invariant component (the terrain) and a set of event points on the time axis. Unlike particle visualization, however, we are not interested in the entireness of the particle system, neither in all particle paths. Instead, we are interested in the single time steps and the events happening at a given point in time or in a given time interval.</p><p>A number of researchers have addressed the issues behind camera control in manipulation and exploration applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Fedak et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> describe a system for underwater tracking and visualization of seals and whales. However, they only address the three-dimensional data exploration and do not consider the interactive exploration of the fourth dimension. When the time is taken into account, most of the efforts result in a movie generation. Palamidese <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> describes a context driven camera motion. Drucker and Zeltzer <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> propose camera controls based on an analysis of the tasks, which are required in a specific environment. Gleicher and Witkin <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> address a similar problem. They propose methods for camera manipulation using features seen through the lens of the camera. Galyean <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> proposes a method called the river analogy. He describes a system, which pulls the user within a given time along a predefined path. This guidance guarantees that the user will not miss given events, while providing some degree of interactivity. He applies a spring/damper system with variable spring/damper constants. One end of the spring is attached to a particle continuously moving along the predefined path. The virtual camera is attached to the other end. Depending on the location of the moving particle on the path, different values for the spring/damper system are applied. Thus, different degree of interactivity is given to the user. Even though the river flow is a simple and powerful concept, it is predefined and constant, thus, no interactive time control is possible.</p><p>Unfortunately, none of the authors consider the interactive exploration of four-dimensional data. In this work, we describe a concept and implementation for visualization and interaction with data that contain a time component. We describe tools providing guided exploration, as well as free interactive viewing of all components of the data.</p><p>Throughout this work, we will demonstrate the entire process from the data acquisition to the visualization and guided exploration on a particular event: the peasants' migrations and battles during the peasants' war in 1525 in Germany. Even though, we present only this example, the proposed techniques can be used for visualizing any type of motion in time, no matter whether this is a 90 minutes hiking trial or migration with duration of many thousands of years. In addition, the proposed techniques allow for the simultaneous exploration of any arbitrary number of motions in time. The only requirement is, that the underlying terrain model does not change within the visualized time interval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data Acquisition and Preparation</head><p>The data originate from notes and delineations recorded during the peasants' war in the spring of 1525. They contain the route of the peasants, from village to village gathering people and protesting against the feudal system and the growing taxes. Unfortunately, the original data sheets were destroyed during world war two. We only have copies of the delineations and notes made before they were destroyed. The copies show the motion of the peasants as a simple polygonal line lo (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). However, these documents are hand made and hence not very accurate. Therefore, no direct mapping onto a terrain model followed by instant visualization is possible. Instead, in the first step we had to transfer by hand these data (lo) onto a 2D topographic map lm.</p><p>On the other hand, we have a triangulated terrain model of the corresponding 2D topographic map. Thus, the next step of the data preparation is to assign height to the 2D line lm. For each point we can determine the height by interpolating the z-coordinate of the corresponding triangle points. Applying this approach to all point pairs in lm results in a three-dimensional line lt, which lies exactly on the surface of the terrain.</p><p>The digital elevation model is acquired from a real digital elevation model with 5 meters resolution. For performance reasons, we have simplified the model. Thus, our final data set consists of not more than 25,000 triangles. This amount of data can be rendered o l <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: The copies of the original maps showing the path of the peasants. We only have single pictures at our disposal (therefore the gaps between the images), copied before the originals were destroyed.</p><p>with reasonable frame rates of at least 25fps on currently available consumer graphics hardware.</p><p>At this stage of the data preparation we have a three-dimensional line lt. However, we do not have yet information about the time values associated with it. Fortunately, for some of the places visited by the peasants, we know the exact arrival and departure times, which were recorded by participants in the war. These points define the mapping of the 3D polygon lt into the four-dimensional space (l f ). The times associated with the points between two timesampled points are interpolated. Thus, to each intermediate point we assign a time value depending on the distance to the closest time-sampled points, concerning the time. In the remainder of this work, we will call the polygon pieces between two time-sampled points timed segments. The entire data pre-processing pipeline is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. In order to enhance realism, instead of assuming constant speed, we introduced constraints to the interpolation of time between two time-sampled points. In particular, we assigned decrease of the velocity depending on the elevation, respectively acceleration of the velocity in parts with decreasing elevation. This is done for each pair of points on the line l f . After accomplishing this step, we can start with the data visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data Visualization</head><p>There are various ways of displaying four-dimensional data. The most convenient way is to compute a projection along one of the four axes. This reduction of a four-dimensional problem to a threedimensional visualization is also applied in our historical data visualization. In particular, we are always displaying three-dimensional slices of the four-dimensional space. In contrast to a movie, which undergoes the same transformation (from 3D to 2D), the tools we propose here enable interaction with the 4D data, and not only equidistant 2D slicing of a 3D data set (i.e. showing a movie). In our scenario, each displayed 3D scene is either a real slice of the 4D space orthogonal to the time axis, or a projection of a time interval parallel to the time axis. In the latter case, the result of the projection is a set of points each of which originally lay on a time slice of the 4D space. In case the time value of a queried point (the fourth dimension) lies between two time-sampled points (thus slices in 4D), we perform four-dimensional linear interpolation before the point is projected parallel to the time axis. The connection of all projected points in the resulting 3D image corresponds to the way (l f ) of the tracked subject within the given time interval.</p><p>For displaying the path l f or parts of it, we have applied truncated cones as basic primitives. The cone centers lie on the line between point pairs of l f . Unlike cylinders, which can be applied to visualize data with constant radius, with truncated cones we are also able to visualize time-varying data interpolating the radii between the points of a timed segment. Hence, we are able to display one more parameter. An example for such a parameter is the number of the people participating in the migration and will be discussed later on (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3)</ref>.</p><p>For visualizing the data, we utilize a modified version of the OpenGL's extrusion library <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. This library provides a set of functions for extruding a geometry shape along a given threedimensional path. Unfortunately, the extrusion has to be computed for every frame, even if the input data do not change. Therefore, we modified this library in such a way that the extrusion is computed only once in a pre-processing step, whereas the resulting triangle strips are stored. During visualization, triangles belonging to sample points within the currently activated time interval are displayed using the pre-computed geometry. The beginning and the end of the extrusion have to be computed each time the current time (interval) has changed. This step is necessary, since the interactively adjusted time values can lie, considering the time, between two points on the four-dimensional polygonal line l f . With this pre-processing, we achieve rendering times of 40 fps on average with a terrain model consisting of 25,000 triangles and extrusion with approximately 40,000 triangles (750 sample points, for each pair of points 40 triangles, plus additional triangles for the joints between each two truncated cones) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</p><p>When the extrusion is drawn, various parameters are visualized. The diameter of the extrusion is used to visualize the number of people in the displayed migration segment. The color of the migration is used to differentiate the affiliation of the people (e.g. "red" vs. "blue"), but it can also be used to display the "mood" of the troops. In general, it can be used to visualize any up to threedimensional information using pseudo colors (in the 3D RGBspace).</p><p>The proposed visualization method offers even the ability to display many timed segments simultaneously. We realized this with a single global time parameter, which can be interactively manipulated by the user. During rendering, each timed segment renders its parts in the given global time interval. This enables the visualization of complex battles and even tracking (parts of) several people's lives simultaneously.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Interaction Concepts</head><p>So far, we have described the data acquisition, management, and display. In this section, we discuss in detail the interaction concept. Due to the fact, that there is no simple way of interacting with fourdimensional data, we have to apply the projection parallel to the time axis as described in Section 3. Furthermore, in order to enable interactive visualization concerning all four parameters and not restrict the visualization to a simple movie, we consider the following conceptually different interaction strategies:</p><p>(a) Interaction with fixed time value/interval and adjustable position in space;</p><p>(b) Interaction with a fixed position and adjustable time;</p><p>(c) Interaction with freely adjustable time and space (3 1/2 D).</p><p>Case (a) is a trivial case, in which the interaction is reduced to regular terrain visualization, since we display the projection of a fixed time (interval) parallel to the time axis. In case (b) the interaction is more powerful and enables visualization not only of the peasants' position, but also display of their movements within an interactively adjusted time interval. Although, the alternating combination of (a) and (b) allows for vivid exploration of the data, it does not allow for interactive manipulation of various parameters simultaneously. Thus, the most interesting case is case (c), which is discussed in detail in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Continuous Time Increment</head><p>Even though it is difficult to navigate through time and space simultaneously, one of these parameters can be adjusted to be continuously incremented. This implies that the incremented parameter is a one-dimensional parameter, or there is another way of mapping one continuously changing value to a multi dimensional parameter. While this parameter is being continuously incremented, the space spanned by the remaining axes can be freely navigated. When this is applied to the time parameter in our scenario, the event-space time (or simply event time) is incremented by a fixed value. In other words, the event time is elapsing, while the user can navigate freely through the space. If we imagine a two-dimensional data set and a time dimension, this concept corresponds to the movement of a slice orthogonal to the time axis (i.e. a movie, consisting of 2D images and a time axis). In the four-dimensional scenario, a 3D hyper-plane is continuously moved in the 4D space. The analogy to a continuously incremented time interval in 4D is the motion of a slice with certain thickness in the three-dimensional scenario. The data within this slice is projected parallel to the time axis and the resulting image is displayed.</p><p>In order to enable free exploration of the four-dimensional space, we increase the current time value by an user adjusted increment. While the time value is continuously increased, the threedimensional projection (at each point in time) can be freely navigated. Note that the time increment cannot only be adjusted with arbitrary precision, but it can have also a negative value, thus allowing backward motion in time.</p><p>We also implemented an adaptive strategy for the time increment ti. In particular, if the space distance between two points in time (Pt and Pt+t i ) is smaller than a given value d, the time increment ti is increased until d is exceeded. In other words, in time intervals in which the displayed geometry does not change significantly ti is increased (see also <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). On the other hand, if the distance in space between two points in time Pt and Pt+t i is greater than the value d, the time increment ti is decreased (e.g. halved) until either the distance drops below d, or the minimum time step is reached. In the latter case, the speed of motion is too large to allow display of smaller pieces of way.</p><p>Optionally, we provide a time scale that displays to each point in time the speed of motion of the tracked subject. This additional information helps to easily discover intervals in time with no motion at all (e.g. during the night time) or such with high speed of motion. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the speed of motion coded as a gray scale value. White color indicates segments with high velocity of motion, while dark regions show segments with slower motion. For simplicity, the speed is assumed constant between two time-sampled points. miniaturized window also changes. The computation of the camera path for this visualization is discussed in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Navigation with Continuous Space Movement</head><p>A strategy, similar to the introduced time increment strategy has been implemented for the space parameter. Even though, the space is not a one-dimensional parameter, we can use a (pre-)computed parameterized path in space. Instead of continuously increasing the event time, the user can now interactively explore the event time while being guided through the space.</p><p>There are two possible ways of defining a path in space. In the first scenario, the user is required to interactively select points, which are interpolated with Hermite splines <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> in order to provide a smooth, interpolating camera path (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4)</ref>. Note, that in this case, the view direction is not taken into account.</p><p>In the second scenario, we can use the path of a time-tracked subject. This path is now shifted in z-direction, such that it lies above the terrain model. Since the original data may contain sharp turns, it has to be smoothed for more convenient virtual camera motion. For the smoothing, we applied the weighted sum of the time-adjacent points as a function of the time t:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P t = j∈[−k,k]</formula><p>(Pt+j)fw(j) + Pzo Whereas Pt+j = P (t + j) is a point on l f at time t + j, [−k, k] is the time interval in which the points are taken into account, Pzo is the offset zo, and fw(j) is the weight of each point used for the computation of the new point P t . The weight function is a simple Gaussian function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">fw(x) = e −x 2 p</formula><p>with parameter p defining the impact of the function in terms of the number of points affecting the final position of P t , thus p depends on k.</p><p>Once the virtual camera path is defined, the user is required to define the velocity of the flight. This is done interactively modeling the curve of the velocity for the generated path. The result of this step is the function f (x), which maps to each x a camera position in the space. Interpreting the x parameter as user time, introduces a second time value to the system, which is continuously incremented by xi. Depending on the speed of the motion, xi is assigned such a value that will cause the camera to move at desired speed.</p><p>When this step is accomplished, the user can start "flying" along the path. During the flight, the displayed event time, respectively the event time interval can be interactively adjusted and viewed. This strategy can be compared with flying a plane along a predefined route and adjusting the event time in such a way, that one can observe the events happening in the current view frustum. Unlike the continuous event time increment described in the previous section, in this scenario the user can freely manipulate the event time, while the user time is incremented continuously. Thus, another way of exploring a four-dimensional data set is introduced. Unfortunately, such navigation has one main limitation: the manipulated data can be "out of sight". This means that the extrusion corresponding to the interactively adjusted time interval is not in the viewing frustum of the user. Therefore, the more flexible way of interaction is to allow the user to choose an arbitrary view direction while being pulled along the virtual camera path. If the aim of the visualization is to provide guidance through the four-dimensional space, the set of techniques proposed in the next section has to be used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Guided Exploration of Time and Space</head><p>In order to facilitate the exploration, we also provide guided exploration. This corresponds to motion through the 4D space with predefined path in space and predefined time for each point on the path. Thus, the proposed approach can also be utilized for animation generation.</p><p>The implementation is an extension of the approaches described in the previous section: we have to define a path in space providing additionally fixed orientation for each of the points on the path. We have to consider this viewing direction and to guarantee that the moving time-dependent extrusion is always within the view frustum of the camera. When a path is interactively defined setting camera positions and orientations, the view direction is implicitly set. It is interpolated by the Hermite splines addressed above. For the interpolation, we have to consider the motion of the tracked extrusion. This is applied as an additional constraint for the computation of the viewing direction. As soon as the moving extrusion reaches the border of the image seen from the current camera, the camera is slightly rotated in order to keep track of it.</p><p>This approach proved to work well, in case the motion of the displayed extrusion in the time is uniform and not too "jumpy". Even stops with longer duration are managed successfully, since we have used not only the extrusion seen from the current camera, but also considered few steps of the future movement. Thus, this method provides smooth deceleration and acceleration on sudden "stop and go"-events in the visualized extrusion.</p><p>Unlike Gleicher and Witkin <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, we compute the orientation of the camera during the flight generation. We also have to deal with dynamic objects, the positions of which change in the viewed threedimensional space. However, since we always know the position of the extrusion at the current and later time, this is taken into account as well. The result of this step is a path in space, tracking the motion of the time depending events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>In this work, we have presented a concept for visualization of fourdimensional data. We first described how the original data are mapped onto a terrain model and how the known time events are used to generate a real four-dimensional data set. Afterwards, we discussed in detail different exploration strategies that can be considered as 3 1/2D navigation approaches. We applied the concept of letting one of the dimensions to be continuously "floating". This enables interactive exploration, while being guided through time or space. Furthermore, we describe a picture-in-picture display mode, imparting the ability to simultaneously explore the data interactively and have a look from the tracked subject's perspective. Finally, we presented an approach for automatic guidance in the explored four-dimensional space. This is a useful feature for generating animations and non-interactive exploration.</p><p>In conclusion, it turned out that the interactive exploration with continuous time increment is the best way to navigate through the data. It enables intuitive navigation, while the elapsing event time has the same behavior as the real user time. This was the favorite approach of our partners from the historical department of the University of Stuttgart.</p><p>The second favorite technique was the provided "fly-with" mode, enabling the simultaneous viewing of two perspectives: The interactively manipulated user viewpoint and the miniaturized view of time-tracked data. This technique allows the user to put himself/herself in place of the peasants and to view the situation from their point of view, thus, helping to understand the reasons for some of their decisions.</p><p>The set of all introduced techniques, provided a valuable navigation aid for exploring four-dimensional data containing a time dimension, as it has been shown with the particular historical data. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Data pre-processing pipeline.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 3 Figure 3 :</head><label>33</label><figDesc>also shows another visualization approach enabling convenient visualization: the picture-in-picture display.

When the time parameter is interactively changed, the new view shown in the The brighter the color of the extrusion, the faster the motion: The single timed segments are between the time-sampled points A to G. Points with two associated times are either visited twice (e.g. B) or the velocity of motion dropped at these places to zero (e.g. C, E, and F ).
