			<abstract>
				<p>The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) experiment at the Brookhaven National Lab is designed to study how the universe came into being. It is believed that after the Big Bang, the universe expanded and cooled, consisting of a soup of quarks, gluons, electrons and neutrinos. As the temperature lowered, electrons combined with protons and formed neutral atoms. Later, clouds of atoms contracted into stars. In this paper, we describe how techniques of volume rendering and information visualization are used to visualize the large particle track data set generated from this high energy physics experiment. The system, called TrackVis, is based on our earlier work of VolVis-Volume Visualization software. Example images of real particle collision data are shown, which are helpful to physicists in investigating the behavior of strongly interacting matter at high energy density.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In order to study the state of matter which existed at the beginning of the universe, physicists have tried to recreate the conditions of the early universe, approximately 1 millionth of a second after it exploded into being. It is thought that in this brief instant, the fundamental subconstituents (quarks and gluons) of matter had not yet condensed into the composite particles (hadrons) which we know to form the physical universe today. Rather, the early universe is believed to have consisted of a plasma of the subconstituents of matter which were deconfined and therefore free to interact with one another. To observe and study a transition to this primoridial phase of matter is one of the primary challenges presently before nuclear and particle physicists.</p><p>The effort to produce the necessary conditions in the laboratory is accomplished at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> of the Brookhaven National Lab (BNL). Let's understand the meaning of RHIC first. The Relativistic of RHIC describes objects traveling near the speed of light. At this speed, motion is governed not by Newton's laws, but by Einstein's theory of relativity. An ion is an atom that has been stripped of its electrons, leaving only the nucleus. Heavy ions are so called because their nuclei contain many protons and neutrons. A collider is a particle accelerator in which two beams of particles circulate in opposite directions and can collide head-on at very high energy. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the physical facilities that make up the RHIC. The RHIC consists of a huge ring and several of BNL's existing particle accelerators, such as ATR, AGS, etc., which have been linked together to provide a continuous path for the RHIC's beam to travel.</p><p>Beginning at the bottom right, the blue lines trace the underground tunnels that bring the particle beam into the RHIC. Then, the beam is divided and sent in one of two directions; clockwise, shown as the yellow line, and counterclockwise, shown as the blue line. Collisions occur at six points on the ring, forming intersections. There are specially designed detectors at these intersections to record collision data. In a collision, particles won't be completely destroyed. The ion bunches will actually pass through one another, creating a hot, dense area that will last only a tiny fraction of a second. As this area cools, some of the ions' energy will convert to matter. In the experiment, gold nuclei at ultra high energy are used. When these heavy ions collide head to head, a highly compressed, high temperature state in which a phase transition to a deconfined state is expected. In the aftermath of a central AuAu collision, thousands of particles are produced which need to be observed and visualized, both individually and collectively to extract meaningful science from this experiment. McCormick et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> proposed a volume rendering method for this kind of high energy physical experiments. In their work, they were interested in the particle density data. Each of the voxels in the volume would contain a count of the number of particles mapped to it. Users can selectively control the transparency and colors used in rendering. However in this work, our concern is to help the scientists to find the correlation between each particle track. Due to the overwhelming complexity of the particle states produced at the RHIC, a fundamentally new approach to analyze and understand data is required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Track Reconstruction</head><p>STAR is one of the two large experiments at the RHIC. Its primary purpose is to search for signatures of quark-gluon plasma formation and investigate the behavior of strongly interacting matter at a high energy density by focusing on measurements of hadron production over a large solid angle. As the heavy gold nuclei collide at the center of the pipe, they send out showers of subatomic particles. Because of the magnetic force generated by the multi-layered cylinders in the pipe, these particles eventually hit STAR's many particle detection sensors, which record the impact of those particles and feed the information to computers as raw data. Later, physicists retrieve and sort through the data to reconstruct what happened in the collision.</p><p>The information of tracks is stored in different tables. When a charged particle moves in a static uniform magnetic field, its trajectory is a helix. To reconstruct its geometry, we need at least five parameters: the starting point, the length of the track, the dip angle at the starting point, the azimuthal angle at the starting point and the curvature. Based on the helix rendering technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the 3D position of the points on each track can be calculated by the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x´sµ x 0 • cos´φ • h ¡ s ¡ 1 r ¡ cos´λµµ cos´φµµ ¡ r (1) y´sµ y 0 • sin´φ • h ¡ s ¡ 1 r ¡ cos´λµµ sin´φµµ ¡ r (2) z´sµ z 0 • s ¡ sin´λµ (3)</formula><p>where s is the path length along the helix; (x 0 ,y 0 ,z 0 ) is the starting point at s s 0 0; λ is the dip angle at the starting point; r is the radius at the starting point; φ is the azimuthal angle at the starting point; h is the sense of rotation of the projected helix in the XYplane, h sign´qBµ; B is the z component of the homogeneous magnetic field and q is the charge of the particle. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the projection of a helix onto the XY plane. As the curvature is zero, <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Projection of a helix on the XY plane the geometry of a track reduces to a straight line. The formulas will change to</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x´sµ x 0 • s ¡ cos´λµ ¡ sin´φ 0 µ (4) y´sµ y 0 • s ¡ cos´λµ ¡ cos´φ 0 µ (5) z´sµ z 0 • s ¡ sin´λµ<label>(6)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Track Visualization</head><p>The method used currently in the RHIC visualization employs the OpenGL standard graphics library. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> shows one of the result. Using this approach, users can interactively change the viewpoint position, orientation and the colors of different types of tracks. This approach works well if we don't have many tracks and collision points. As the real experiment begins, there are thousands of tracks in one event. The 3D overlap and occlusion become so serious that it is almost impossible for the researchers to see the specific tracks clearly. We need an approach that not only helps us understand the specific tracks, but also gives a global view of the rest of the data.</p><p>To solve the problem, we developed the TrackVis system, based on volume rendering techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. During the track reconstruction step, we resampled the data on a predefined grid. Taking advantage of the transparency character of the volume data, researchers can concentrate on specific tracks, while still keeping the global view of the rest of the data. In order to achieve interactive speed, our system uses a VolumePro real-time volume rendering board <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> on a PC. By combining interactive 3D visualization of flow fields with scalar information, our system helps researchers to understand the global properties of the final state that the particles produced in RHIC interactions in a better way. The system is based on our earlier work on VolVis -Volume Visualization software <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, compiled using the library for VolumePro, and is written in Visual C++ 6.0. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> shows the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of TrackVis, along with a 3D view of 3384 particle tracks from a real experiment. The left panel is the control panel. Physicists can change the 3D cursor, light, blending and other parameters here. The bottom right part is the RGBA transfer function window, allowing physicists to change the transfer function and color mapping functions. In this image, we use white for tracks we are interested in, blue for the starting points of tracks, red for the ending points of tracks, and gray for all the other tracks. Physicists can manipulate the transfer function to render only a part of the features.</p><p>Currently our system supports the following functions:</p><p>Zoom in and out By changing the grid size, this function enables researchers to magnify part of the track data in order to have a better observation. Feature representation using scalar value Various track parameters such as energy and types of track particles can be mapped to the intensity values of voxels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Track filtering</head><p>Physicists can change the range of parameters to display only the tracks satisfying the conditions. For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure  5</ref>, we display tracks with curvature between 0.007 and 0.009 and map track energy to the intensity value of voxels, we can see from the bottom right window that the corresponding energy parameter also falls in a specific range. This proves the physical principle that the higher the energy value, the lower the curvature value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Range of interest specification</head><p>This helps physicists to decide which portion of the data to render.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Track clustering</head><p>Tracks can also be clustered into groups based on their difference in curvature, dip angle or other parameters. This function can dramatically decrease the number of tracks displayed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fisheye view</head><p>The function of Zoom in and out scales the data set with a same factor. Fisheye view can help researchers to view both the data in focus and the global data. Currently there are two distortion functions in our system. We will discuss them further in the next section. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows the 3D cursor of the system. It can be displayed as crosshairs or planes. Physicists can specify the radius of the interesting area centered at the 3D cursor. The size of the grid can also be changed to 64 ¢ 64 ¢ 64, 128 ¢ 128 ¢ 128 and 256 ¢ 256 ¢ 256. This image here shows only the part of the tracks researchers are interested in. It is discretized on a 128 ¢ 128 ¢ 128 grid. The bottom window shows the energy distribution of that subset of tracks.</p><p>Besides the volume rendering functions, we also have a dialogue used especially for track visualization. Physicists can change clustering conditions, filtering variables, the fisheye view parameter, zoom in and zoom out factors, and other features through the dialogue window. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Nonlinear Magnification</head><p>Nonlinear magnification <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> is a technique to stretch and distort spaces in order to produce effective visualization of data. Several methods have been introduced in the literature of information visualization. Here we implement a 3D fisheye view. A fisheye lens is a very wide angle lens that magnifies nearby objects, while shrinking distant objects. It is a valuable tool for observing both local detail and global context at the same time. Two 1D functions are supported in our TrackVis f isheye f unction :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">g´xµ ´d•1µx dx•1 (7)</formula><p>f´xµ tanh´dxµ <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> where d is the distortion factor. Applying these 1D functions directly to the X,Y and Z axis, we get a 3D fisheye. This type of transformation is called the orthogonal transformation. If the 1D function is applied to the radius component of the polar coordinates of the grid points, it is a radial transformation. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows the effect of a fisheye view. Image (b) is the result of using a 3D orthogonal transformation of the fisheye function, while image (a) is the original view of a subset of tracks. Physicists can change the distortion factor to specify the amount of magnification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Applications</head><p>There are many physics research groups in the STAR experiment, such as the EbyE (Event by Event group), the PEC (Peripheral Collisions group), the Spin (Spin physics group) and the Strangeness (Strangeness physics group). Each of them has a different emphasis on the same data set. Our TrackVis visualization system advances the tool-set currently available to the RHIC scientists, so that they can understand the regions-of-interest in the space of the data with little effort. For example, in the Strangeness group, researchers are interested in a kink position between two tracks. The candidate tracks should satisfy a set of conditions: they should have the same charge; their 3D distance at the closest point should be less than a specific value, the distance of the last point of the parent track and the first point of daughter track must be less than a certain value, and the decay angle should be greater than a predetermined number, etc.. However, in the experiment, many different topologies can occur and could fake a real candidate; for instance, a track could be interrupted. On the other hand, the vertex point may be relatively far from the kink and this complicates the search and the identification of actual candidates. Based on our TrackVis, researchers can interactively specify their requirement of track energy, decay angle, etc. through the user interface, limiting the number of track pairs. By modifying the transfer function, they can emphasize the tracks they are interested in, while having a global view of the other tracks. The fisheye view also helps them to discover the fake candidates quickly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We described how we used volume rendering and information visualization methods to establish the TrackVis system for the RHIC project to help easily physicists investigate their experiments. Our system is general, easy to use, low-cost, customizable, extensible, fast and portable. New feature representation methods, clustering techniques and magnification methods can also be added easily. It has an immense potential to enhance the infrastructure of many science and engineering applications. Many physics research groups benefit from our system. As the experiment continues, new physical models of tracks, such as the multiple scattering model, will be included in the system. As the amount of data generated from the experiment increases dramatically, a fundamentally new model in the feature space, such as a NURBS magnification model, will be needed. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Physical facility of the RHIC experiment.
