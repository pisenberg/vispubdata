			<abstract>
				<p>For psychophysical studies in spatial cognition a virtual model of the picturesque old town of Tübingen has been constructed. In order to perform psychophysical experiments in highly realistic virtual environments the model is based on high quality texture maps adding up to several hundreds of MBytes. To accomplish the required real-time frame updates, view frustum and occlusion culling without visibility pre-processing, levels of detail, and texture compression are applied in an interleaved manner. Shared memory communication and a standard PC with two commodity graphics cards is used to enable the powerful combination of those techniques because this combination is not yet available on a single graphics card.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The model of Virtual Tübingen is an example for using Virtual Environments in spatial cognition research. It can be used for comparative studies between real and virtual environments to validate the experimental results objectively. A high fidelity "Virtual Reality" environment enables to provide participants in experiments a level of sensory realism, which is as close to their experiences in real world as possible. Thus, a relatively simple geometry for the buildings is used and photographs of the actual city are applied as highly detailed texture maps. The size of the model is several tens of thousands of polygons and several hundreds of megabytes of texture.</p><p>The real time management of the scene complexity -here the huge amount of textures -is one of the key problems. Until very recently, graphics hardware for commodity PCs did not offer more than a few MByte of texture memory but even with todays cards with 32 to 128 MByte of on-board memory, there is still not enough space to store this huge amount of textures. So far, a 3-pipe Infinite Reality2 Onyx2 with two raster manager boards per pipe was used to accomplish interactive frame updates.</p><p>To overcome the lack of insufficient texture memory space, an interleaved combination of view frustum culling, occlusion culling, levels of detail, as well as texture compression based on the available OpenGL extension (ARB texture compression) is applied to Virtual Tübingen. Thus, one can accomplish real-time frame updates on commodity PC Hardware.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Related Work</head><p>Culling invisible objects is one of the classic topics in computer graphics <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Early approaches are based on culling hierarchical £ WSI/GRIS, University of Tübingen, Auf der Morgenstelle 10/C9, D-72076 Tübingen, Germany, Email: meissner,jorman @gris.unituebingen.de Ý Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics Spemannstraße 38, D-72076 Tübingen, Germany, Email: Stephan.Braun@tuebingen.mpg.de subdivision blocks of scenes to the view-frustum <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Although this is a simple but effective scheme for close-ups or walk-throughs, it is not suited to reduce the occlusion depth per pixel. Level-of-detail (LoD) rendering is another approach to reduce the rendering complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, generating different LoDs of objects. During rendering, the appropriate LoD is determined depending on the distance of the object to the observer, its screen space size, and other parameters. Thus, the rendering complexity of objects which are further away is effectively reduced.</p><p>Visibility has been of special interest for walk-throughs of architectural scenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> and rendering of large models <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Unfortunately, most of these approaches are limited to room-or cave-like scenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> or do not provide interactive rendering (more than 10 frames/second) of large models on commodity graphics hardware <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Furthermore, many do require a significant amount of pre-processing and are limited in their application for dynamic scenes.</p><p>In December 1997, Hewlett-Packard proposed an OpenGL extension for occlusion culling <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Similar to the hierarchical zbuffer approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, graphic primitives, which represent a more complex geometry, are rendered within an occlusion test mode to determine their visibility. Depending on the result, all underlying geometry is rendered or skipped. Shortly after this announcement, an almost identical approach has been presented by SGI on their Visual PC and very recently, nVIDIA announced such an occlusion query for the NV 20 but it is yet not available in the API.</p><p>Finally, texture compression is yet another technique to reduce the bandwidth requirements. While there are many lossy and lossless compression techniques for textures, hardware support for compressed textures within OpenGL is rare. Knittel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> proposed a texture mapping hardware using a tile based compression technique. S3 first offered a commercially available hardware using a similar compression scheme. Very recently, the OpenGL ARB 1 included this compression under ARB texture compression and it is supported on the ATI Radeon and nVIDIA NV 20.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Building Virtual Tübingen</head><p>One of the fundamental difficulties in building a virtual environment is the trade off between a highly realistic 3D model and the computational demands imposed by the model.</p><p>On the one hand, if the model is too simplistic, the resulting behavior in a virtual environment will not coincide with behavior in the real world. On the other hand, if the model is too detailed, spatial or temporal mismatches can arise such as difficulties in grabbing a virtual object with a hand, or a delayed response after pressing a virtual button <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> due to a too low frame rate.</p><p>Cognitive research in object recognition has shown that biological recognition systems do not need detailed structural descriptions of the objects to be recognized. They rely more on image based representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Therefore, Virtual Tübingen focuses more on highly detailed texture maps and uses relatively simple geometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> OpenGL Architectural Review Board.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Geometric Processing</head><p>For the construction of 3D-models of the buildings architectural drawings provided by the city administration of Tübingen are used. Separate plans for each floor of almost every building are available, as well as drawings of the front and backside of those buildings (left of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). The geometric processing proceeds as follows: A graphics tablet is used to digitize each floor. The most relevant points of the shell on each of these drawings are picked. These are mostly corner points and very easy to determine interactively. The front and back views are used to determine the height of each floor as well as the shape and the height of the roof. After having digitized the drawings in this way, a purpose-built software tool is used, generating a polygonal 3D-model of the house. As a result, a triangulated model of the building is obtained, as illustrated in the middle of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Texture Processing</head><p>As mentioned before, most of the realism derives from photographs that are taken from the real buildings in Tübingen. Because the majority of buildings are actually houses grouped together in blocks, these sides are mostly front sides. The textures covering the ground floor of the buildings have a resolution of 1 pixel every 1-2 cm and half the resolution at each subsequent floor. Typically the streets in Tübingen are only 5 meters wide while the houses are 15 meters high. This causes some problems with shadowing and obstacles, but means that even with a wide angle lens one cannot capture a house from the front in a single photograph. The picture shows a considerable trapezoidal distortion and therefore two or more photographs are needed to cover the whole front. A tool called Cor-Tex (Correcting Textures) was developed that allows to map the distorted images in a perspective correct way onto the polygonal model. CorTex is based on an algorithm given by Heckbert <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. This fast mapping procedure allows for the automatic and consistent control of texture resolution and thus supports multiple levelsof-detail. An example of a textured house is shown in the right part of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Street Modeling</head><p>Embedding the buildings in a landscape of streets is one of the challenges in this project. The houses are aligned to each other utilizing a polygon with a map texture on it. Since no height data is available for the old part of the city it is difficult to adjust the vertical scale of the houses. A technical map shows the contours of the buildings and altitude of some points on the street. This information is sufficient for obtaining the gradients of the streets. After adding the streets to the model, the vertical position of the buildings is aligned using the actual altitude of the street. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows a typical street with height differences. The result of the modeling process is a hierarchical Performer <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> scene graph which holds the entire model with all of its level of detail nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Custom Rendering</head><p>Besides the tremendous challenge of modeling such a highly detailed city model, it is also extremely demanding to render. Even though the polygon load is fairly low (few tens of thousands of polygons), the overall texture load is overwhelming (several hundreds of MByte), and thus the real challenge when rendering this model. So far, a three-pipe SGI Onyx2 Infinite Reality2 was used to render Virtual Tübingen simply because the IR2 was the only machine offering large texture memory (64 MByte) as well as antialiasing 2 . Fortunately, rendering such a model on PCs is now feasible since Performer runs on PC class machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> and commodity PC graphics hardware also offers large texture memories, anti-aliasing, and even texture compression and hardware support for occlusion culling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Preprocessing</head><p>One severe restriction for the rendering was that the scene is not static but dynamic. During the experiments of the human spatial cognition, houses are exchanged, moved, and resized. Thus, many techniques as i.e. an aspect graph cannot be applied. Due to this boundary condition, the occlusion test as introduced by Hewlett-Packard (occlusion flag), was the algorithm of choice for testing visibility on the fly.</p><p>Despite the dynamic behavior, preventing the pre-computation of visibility information, some pre-computations can still be done. First, the texture compression is done by requesting all textures of the scene, building a mipmap of each texture using gluBuild2DMipMaps(), compressing each level using glCom-pressedTexImage2DARB(), and finally replacing the uncompressed textures in the Performer scene graph. Second, for each house compiled display lists are generated and stored in the corresponding nodes. No further pre-computations are performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Scene graph traversal and sorting</head><p>The conventional rendering approach in Performer is thread based, interleaving tasks such as view frustum culling, occlusion culling, drawing, etc. of subsequent frames and one can define call-back functions to perform those tasks. There are several issues preventing the use of this concept within the context of Virtual Tübingen: first, on Linux there is (currently) no multi-thread support by Performer. Second, each task traversing the scene graph receives as input the output of the previous task, causing scene graph traversal overhead. Furthermore, the here implemented occlusion culling approach -based on the HP occlusion flag <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>) -performs best for front to back sorted rendering and requires a tight interleaving of the actual drawing process and the occlusion culling process. Therefore, a fully custom traversal and rendering approach was chosen.</p><p>For each frame, each node of the scene graph is touched only once. The scene graph traversal is performed by keeping a list of active scene nodes, named DepthList. In the initialization step the DepthList contains only one element, a pointer to the root node of the scene graph (in case the scene is within the view frustum, else NULL), see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>. While the DepthList is not empty, the head element is removed from the list and processed. Processing a node depends on the node type: in case it is a node within the hierarchy that does not contain any geometry, view frustum culling is performed on all children <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> (1). The children residing in the view frustum are then inserted into the DepthList in front to back order (insertion criteria is the distance of the bounding volume to the eye point). If the currently processed node is a geometry node (pfGeode), occlusion culling is performed using the HP occlusion culling flag <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. If the geometry is determined to be visible, the fully textured house is rendered using the appropriate level of detail.</p><p>The following pseudo-code summarizes the scene graph traversal, sorting, culling, and rendering approach used:  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> illustrates the processing of the nodes and the actual content of the DepthList for the initialization and the first two iterations.</p><p>Once the DepthList is empty, no more nodes need to be processed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Interleaved Culling and Rendering</head><p>While the previously described traversal, culling, and rendering order is valid, it is distributed across two processes and two graphics</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Iteration Init</head><p>Step 1</p><p>Step 2</p><p>. . . cards. The reason is that currently there is no graphics card available that offers texture compression as well as the occlusion test <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . Therefore, a PC with two graphics cards is used in the current setup. The PC is a dual Pentium3 (800 MHz) and contains a nVIDIA NV 20 and a HP fx5. Accessing two different graphics cards with different OpenGL extensions requires that two processes run in parallel. One process (master) takes care of the scene graph traversal, DepthList update, and view frustum and occlusion culling (HP occlusion test on the fx5). Occlusion culling is performed by testing the bounding volumes of the objects. In case an object is detected visible, the display list of this object needs to be rendered to correctly update the framebuffer for subsequent occlusion tests. Fortunately, all but the depth test can be disabled. The result of this process is an array of flags, indicating which object (display list) is visible for a given view. The other process (slave) controlling the nVIDIA NV 20 simply waits for the information which display lists are visible and renders those objects without performing any tests at all. Thus, high quality antialiasing using 2x2 footprints can be used because only few objects are visible at a time.</p><p>The process communication is realized using a common shared memory segment and semaphores. For better performance, the culling and rendering processes are pipelined: while the NV 20 renders frame Ò, the fx5 detects the visible objects of frame Ò • ½ .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>The interleaved culling and rendering approach on two graphics cards is a straight forward solution to combine different functionality not available on a single system. While texture compression requires less storage for textures trading image quality for bandwidth (reduced to 25%), occlusion culling is of great use to easily remove invisible objects, increasing the overall rendering speed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Image Quality</head><p>There are two factors that do influence the image quality: the earlier mentioned texture compression is supported in hardware but it is lossy and thus, image quality is potentially reduced. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4(b)</ref> and (c) show two images of the textures of two houses without and with texture compression. The emphasized image difference is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4(d)</ref> and demonstrates that the difference is largest where high frequencies are present in the texture. Nevertheless, it is generally hard to notice, especially during motion where such details are of less importance. Another option to influence the image quality is full screen anti-aliasing (FSAA). When using ¾ ¢ ¾ oversampling ( GL FSAA QUALITY), a much better image quality is obtained than with all the other possible options which tend to produce severely blurred images 6 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Rendering Performance</head><p>For the performance measurements, results were averaged along a camera path moving around the center of the model oriented such that most of the houses reside within the view frustum. Using a moderate size of the model containing 100 MBytes of textures, the nVIDIA NV 20 was capable of delivering roughly 16 frames per second using texture compression and view frustum culling. However, the frame-rate drops significantly to ½ frames when omitting texture compression due to texture swapping. This is frequently accompanied with inconvenient stalls that can last for a few seconds and unacceptable for virtual reality environments. Combining the two graphics cards reduces the bottleneck by culling the hidden objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , leaving only a few ones to be rendered (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>(e) and (f)). Thus, there is even enough time and bandwidth to enable full screen anti-aliasing ( GL FSAA QUALITY).</p><p>When moving to the full model of the city, no interactivity can be obtained without occlusion culling. The frame-rate is below one due to severe texture swapping, even when enabling texture compression. In contrast, still smooth 10 frames per second are accomplished using the combination of all culling techniques because for each frame only the relevant textures are fetched.</p><p>In summary, with the interleaved culling and rendering on those two cards, stalling can be prevented enabling smooth frame updates which are mandatory for virtual environments. The currently accomplished frame-rate is 23 frames per second for the small model and 10 frames per second for the large model, with room for improvement: so far, only geometry nodes are tested for occlusion but hierarchy nodes could also be tested. This can save valuable and costly occlusion tests, by culling entire groups of Ò hidden geometry nodes in one instead of Ò occlusion tests. Furthermore, instead of using the given scene graph as is, one could rearrange the objects for a better spatial partitioning, again possibly reducing the number of necessary occlusion tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and further increasing the overall performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>Combining the techniques of view-frustum culling, levels of detail, occlusion culling, and texture compression as presented in this paper, allows real-time walk-throughs of large models with textures exceeding the texture memory capacity by far, i.e. "Virtual Tübingen". The advantage of the presented interleaved culling approach is reduced scene traversal time and efficient culling without pre-processing. No pre-processing was mandatory since the houses change in size and location during an experiment which prevents many other well-know visibility techniques from being used.</p><p>In the future, we would like to move to a single graphics card solution which can be expected in the near future since the nVIDIA NV 20 already has the occlusion test in the hardware but it is not yet available in their OpenGL API. Furthermore, one needs to investigate the influence of the texture compression on human perception during spatial cognition tasks and in case an influence can be proven, one might want to use compressed textures during motion only and switch to uncompressed textures when the observer is not moving. As (e) using additional occlusion culling. Note that some houses are occluded but not culled. This is due to wrong tagging as street elements in the original scene graph and occlusion culling is not performed on streets.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Process of constructing a house model.</figDesc></figure>
