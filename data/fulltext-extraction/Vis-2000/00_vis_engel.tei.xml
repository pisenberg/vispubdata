			<abstract>
				<p>For a comprehensive understanding of tomographic image data in medical routine, interactive and high-quality direct volume rendering is an essential prerequisite. This is provided by visualization using 3D texture mapping which is still limited to high-end graphics hardware. In order to make it available in a clinical environment, we present a system which uniquely combines local desktop computers and remote high-end graphics hardware. In this context, we exploit the standard visualization capabilities to a maximum which are available in the clinical environment. For 3D representations of high resolution and quality we access the remote specialized hardware. Various tools for 2D and 3D visualization are provided which meet the requirements of a medical diagnosis. This is demonstrated with examples from the field of neuroradiology which show the value of our strategy in practice.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Interactive visualization is one of the most important means for the investigation of tomographic data resulting from CT and MR scanners. This requires both a 2D analysis to realize the local information within single slice images and a 3D representation conveying the spatial information of lesions and related structures. Compared to indirect strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> which rely on polygonal models, direct volume rendering has proved to be superior in this context <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. It integrates all the available information and provides implicit segmentation of the image data using transfer functions which assign color and opacity to all data values. This avoids time-consuming preprocessing in many cases of practical relevance. Therefore, interactive manipulation and high-quality rendering are essential features for the application in a clinical environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. However, a major drawback for clinical application is the availability of systems which provide the necessary graphics capacity. High-end servers, supercomputers and workstations with special 3D graphics acceleration hardware, numerical computation power and highperformance IO bandwidth provide the necessary means to handle large scientific data sets. On the other hand the computation and rendering capabilities of modern desktop PCs are quickly increasing as demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>In this case study remote volume rendering based on 3D texture mapping and local visualization using JAVA was made available and examined within a clinical environment. After an brief overview in section 2 explaining fundamental issues of the applied £ Institut für Informatik, Abteilung für Visualisierung und Interaktive Systeme, Breitwiesenstr. 20-22, 70565 Stuttgart, Germany, Email: engel@informatik.uni-stuttgart.de</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>¤ ¥</head><p>Neurochirurgische Klinik, Schwabachanlage 6, 91054 Erlangen, Germany, Email: hastreiter@nch.imed.uni-erlangen.de rendering algorithms, the established visualization system is described in section 3. Subsequently, different clinical examples are discussed in section 4 which show the usefulness of our approach in practice. Finally, section 5 illustrates some technical results of our system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Rendering Algorithms</head><p>Modern desktop PC graphics adapters provide sufficient rasterization power to render high resolution volume data sets with interactive frame rates using 2D texture mapping. 3D texture mapping hardware is still only available on mid-size and high-end graphics workstations. Because of this fact two different texture-based rendering algorithms were chosen for the local and remote visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Object Aligned Slices</head><p>The local approach for 3D visualization, which is similar to Shear-Warp algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, is based on 2D texture mapping which is now a standard feature of low-cost graphics adapters. The rectilinear volume data is tripled into three perpendicular stacks of object aligned texture slices (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 1)</ref>. For rendering the texture slices are projected onto three stacks of square slice polygons. The slice stack most perpendicular to the line of sight of the viewer is selected and blended back-to-front into the frame buffer. During the process of texture mapping the volume data is bilinearly interpolated on a slice polygon. The attained frame rate is limited by the rasterization rate of the graphics hardware. A geometry engine which is often not available on low-cost graphics adapters does not increase the frame rate considerably. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">View Aligned Slices</head><p>The use of 3D texture mapping hardware has become a powerful visualization option for interactive high-quality direct volume rendering <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. The rectilinear volume data is first converted to a 3D texture. Then, a number of planes perpendicular to the viewers' line of sight are clipped against the volume bounding box. The texture coordinates in parametric object space are assigned to each vertex of the clipped polygons. During rasterization fragments in the slice are trilinearly interpolated from the 3D texture. The resulting polygons are projected onto the image plane using adequate blending operations to realize back-to-front or front-to-back compositing (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 2</ref>). Since this process is supported by specialized graphics hardware, the time it consumes decreases considerably compared to a software implementation. Thus, interactive frame rates can be achieved. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Visualization System</head><p>In order to exploit the capabilities of the high-end visualization server a native implementation for the server application was chosen. Since many platforms must be supported on the client side, JAVA was selected. Despite JAVAs' performance disadvantages compared to natively compiled software our experience shows that it supplies quite efficient classes for image manipulation and 3D volume visualization.</p><p>The system consists of a JAVA/JAVA2D/JAVA3D based client and a server which is based on C++ and OpenInventor (see <ref type="figure">figure</ref> 3). On the client side first a data set obtained by the scanner is loaded into a slicing tool which allows one to inspect slices in axial, coronal and sagittal directions. A subregion can be selected and locally visualized using a JAVA3D viewer which uses objectaligned textures for the visualization. High quality visualization is available by transferring the volume data to the server application.</p><p>The server application, which utilizes 3D texture mapping hardware was developed based on a stand-alone application <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> which was adapted using the framework introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The server renders images off-screen into the PBuffer which is a non-visible frame buffer. Then the image data is compressed, transferred to the client. The client decodes the data and displays the images in the clients render area. Mouse and GUI events are sent to the server and are processed by OpenInventor which schedules re-rendering when needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Slicing Tool</head><p>The first step of visualization consists of loading DICOM data from the scanner into the slicing tool (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 4)</ref>. The tool allows for the interactive inspection of the data in axial, coronal and sagittal directions. It was implemented using JAVA2D which supplies powerful and efficient classes for rendering and manipulation of image data. The following features are supported: § Slicing and Zooming: Slicing in axial, coronal or sagittal direction in three synchronized panels. Selecting a volume position on one slice panel will show the correspondent slices in the other two panels. While zooming into the volume data nearest-neighbor or bilinear filtering can be applied. § Transfer Function Control and Subregion Selection: The mapping of volume data to RGB values can be interactively manipulated using the transfer function control panel. A rectangular subregion of the volume data for 3D inspection is selectable.  <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: General architecture of the visualization system. Volume data from the scanners is first loaded into the slicing tool. Then a medium quality visualization of a subvolume using the JAVA3D renderer can be performed locally. For high-quality rendering the data is uploaded to the visualization server. The JAVA3D renderer requests a single full frame from the server after local interaction by sending new view parameters. The remote renderer generates a new frame after each mouse interaction, thus resulting in an image stream from the server.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Local Renderer</head><p>After selecting an interesting subregion of the volume data using the slicing tool, a 3D visualization using locally available 3D graphics hardware can be performed. JAVA3D supplies support for 2D and 3D texture mapping. Since low-cost graphics adapters currently do not supply hardware support for 3D texture mapping, objectaligned slices and 2D texture mapping are used for rendering. The following features are supported: § Transformations and Transfer Function Control: The 3D transformations rotation, translation and zoom are available. New transfer functions can be applied to the visualization by changing volume data to RGBA mapping. § Orthogonal Clipping and Isosurface Reconstruction: Since JAVA3D does not support arbitrary clipping planes in currently available release, the tool only support orthogonal clipping. The technique used here was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. § Synchronization with the slicing tool: The 3D visualization and the slicing tool support synchronization in both directions. When slicing through the volume data the correspondent position of the slice is shown in the 3D view. On the other hand a slice probe can be moved in the 3D view and the correspondent 2D slice is displayed in the slicing tool. Because of the limited amount of texture memory on low-price graphics adapters downsampling of the volume data from the slicing tool can be applied. Selecting a threshold, an isosurface is locally reconstructed and integrated into the texture-based volume visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Remote Renderer</head><p>In order to use remotely available high-end graphics hardware on the internet 3D data from the slicing tool is transferred to the server application. The server renders the volume data using 3D texture mapping hardware off screen into the PBuffer. The rendered images are encoded and transferred back to the JAVA client. Here the data is decoded and drawn into the remote render area of the client. Using a JAVA user interface the client offers the same look and feel as the server application based on OpenInventor. In this way there is no difference with respect to the interface whether local or remote 3D graphics hardware is used. Besides, all features of the server application <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> are accessible. In consequence, two basic scenarios are derived: § Remote Rendering: The client application does not perform 3D visualization itself. Remotely generated images are decoded and drawn into the clients render area using JAVA2D BufferedImage class. Locally generated mouse and GUI events are transported to the server and are processed by OpenInventor. In this way the standard manipulators of Open-Inventor are remotely available. The frame rate in this scenario is limited by a number of factors: frame rate on the server, encoding time, transfer time, decoding time and display time. Due to the transfer of data over the network for each frame some latency is introduced. § Hybrid Rendering: During interaction the local JAVA3D renderer is used. When the user stops interacting with the volume data the view and other visualization parameters are transferred to the server. The parameters are applied to the server application and the newly rendered image is transferred back to the client. The client draws the received image into the frame buffer and overwrites the representation which was rendered locally. The scenario reduces latency during interaction, because no network transfer is needed. Using the manipulators of OpenInventor is currently not possible in this scenario because they are locally not available. However, a virtual track ball is supported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Clinical Application</head><p>The visualization method is of major importance for the diagnostic value of an envisaged 3D analysis. Since the clinical environment is restricted to equipment with low-end graphics capabilities the examination of the image data was exclusively based on standard strategies. In order to perform an improved diagnosis, up to now selected data sets were transferred to the department of computer science. Thereby, 3D texture mapping hardware for high quality volume rendering was exploited which is provided within an interactive visualization and navigation tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. As a major drawback, this strategy was limited to a smaller group of patients and to cases which made direct volume rendering indispensable such as the visualization of tiny and complex anatomical structures.</p><p>So far the presented system of local and remote volume rendering was investigated for the diagnosis of 8 cases with intracranial aneurysms. The respective CTA data was acquired with a Siemens Somaton Plus 4 spiral-CT scanner. Additionally, the investigation of 3 cases with dural arteriovenous malformations was performed. These are pathologic connections between arterial and venous blood vessels within the vertebral column. The required MR data was obtained with a Siemens MR Vision 1.5 Tesla scanner which provides the necessary resolution to resolve tiny nerve and vessel structures appropriately. Subsequently, two cases are presented which demonstrate the value of our approach.</p><p>In the first example the examination of an intracranial aneurysm is demonstrated according using the visualization strategy presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Initially, the information contained within the tomographic slice images is investigated (see <ref type="figure">figure 7)</ref>. Then, local visualization is performed with the approach based on JAVA3D which provides a crude spatial orientation (see <ref type="figure">figure 8)</ref>. For a 3D representation of high quality the whole volume or a selected subvolume is rendered with 3D texture mapping on the remote graphics hardware (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">figure 9</ref>). This strategy is also indispensable if the fusion of different data sets is performed to achieve better anatomical understanding (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 10)</ref>. In this case memory requirements prohibit a comparable analysis on the local system.</p><p>The example shown in figures 11 and 12 illustrate the analysis of tiny nerves and intracranial vessels surrounding the brain stem. Additionally, the semi-lunar canals of the inner ear are clearly visible at the outer left and right side. As presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, only coarse regions of the data are segmented explicitly. The delineation of the details is then performed by implicit segmentation based on transfer functions. Due to the limited spatial resolution of the target structures the local visualization is based on slice images exclusively. For a meaningful 3D representation direct volume rendering using 3D texture mapping is essential.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>In all cases volumes consisting of 100-300 slices with a 512¨matrix were used. In order to guarantee high frame rates the consecutive remote 3D-visualization was exclusively performed on a <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>: Remote rendering with 3D texture mapping of the intracranial aneurysm shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 4</ref>. The same look-and-feel is available as with the stand-alone application by providing a decoration similar to Open Inventor. SGI Onyx2 (R10000, 195MHz) with BaseReality graphics hardware providing 64MB of texture memory. Besides, a Pentium III (500MHz, 128MB RAM) with NVidia GForce DDR graphics adapter as client was used. The SGI Onyx was located at the Computer Graphics Group in Erlangen whereas the client was located at the Department of Neurosurgery in Erlangen. The client and the server were connected via a local area wireless 34 MBit TCP/IP network connection.</p><p>In a first step the volume data was loaded into the slice viewer application. Due to the fact that the JAVA2D classes were explicitly developed for 2D image operations, there was no difference in performance between the JAVA slicing tool and a native C++ slicing application. In consequence, slicing through large scale data sets is performed interactively. For the local visualization using JAVA3D, subvolumes with a 256¨matrix and 64 slices were selected using the slice viewer. A performance of 5-10 frames per second was attained for local volume rendering.</p><p>The full volume data sets were transferred to the server for the remote visualization. We used run length encoding for the compression of the image stream over the network. The frame rate for a viewport with 704 pixels width and 576 pixels height was 2-3 fps. When reducing the image size by a factor of 4 during interaction a frame rate of about 15 fps was attained. Due to data encoding and network transmission the latency of the application was noticeably higher. However, it did not restrain interactivity.</p><p>This latency is avoided by the hybrid approach. It combines local interaction and small latency with high-quality visualization from the server after interaction. Due to the trilinear interpolation provided with 3D texture mapping on the server, the image quality is considerably better compared to local rendering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this case study we demonstrated how to utilize local desktop PCs and remotely available high-end graphics hardware for interactive visualization of tomographic image data. We showed different possibilities to combine these capabilities using local, remote and hybrid rendering techniques. The results are most promising and show how to effectively combine local interactivity and high-quality visualization provided by remotely available specialized graphics servers. Applying the presented approach in practice a much larger group of patients benefits from a more comprehensive diagnosis. Further on, the ease of using the rendering capabilities increases the acceptance of volume visualization in clinical routine in general.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Object aligned slice stacks as applied for volume rendering with 2D texture mapping.</figDesc></figure>
