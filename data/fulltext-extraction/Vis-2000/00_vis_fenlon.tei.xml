			<abstract>
				<p>We describe a toolkit for the design and visualization of flexible artificial heart valves. The toolkit consists of interlinked modules with a visual programming interface. The user of the toolkit can set the initial geometry and material properties of the valve leaflet, solve for the flexing of the leaflet and the flow of blood around it, and display the results using the visualization capabilities of the toolkit. The interactive nature of our environment is highlighted by the fact that changes in leaflet properties are immediately reflected in the flow field and response of the leaflet. Hence the user may, in a single session, investigate a broad range of designs, each one of which provides important information about the blood flow and motion of the valve during the cardiac cycle.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>More than 5,000 heart valve replacements are performed in the UK each year, and the design of improved artificial valves is an important area of research. Our contribution to this activity is an integrated visualization and design toolkit which allows the valve designer to choose the shape and mechanical properties of a valve before carrying out numerical flow experiments to determine its behaviour within the heart. In this way, the design can be refined to incorporate desirable features such as a low pressure drop, an optimum stress distribution and favourable haemodynamics. Because of the complex nature of the flow geometry (even in the simplified model which is amenable to numerical treatment), we find that visualization plays a central role in the determination of the characteristics of each valve design.</p><p>Our paper is arranged as follows. In the following section, we give a brief description of the heart and highlight the way in which damage to its valves can necessitate their replacement. Section 3 describes the numerical model for the valve ( § 3.1) and the fluid dynamics of the blood ( § 3.2), while our design and analysis toolkit is presented in Section 4. We discuss our choice of development environment ( § 4.1), introduce a few of the tools we have built ( § 4.2) and give some examples of their use ( § 4.3). We conclude our paper ( § 5) with some final remarks, and indicate future directions for this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">REPLACING HEART VALVES</head><p>The heart can be viewed as two synchronous pumps, each of which consists of a filling chamber (atrium), pumping chamber (ventricle), outlet pipe (artery) and two valves between the chambers and the artery. The flow of blood is directed by the valves opening and closing-roughly two and a half billion times during an average lifetime. Because of these demands (which are most extreme for the aortic valve between the left ventricle and the artery) the valves are susceptible to damage which can result in serious-even fatal-illness.</p><p>When a valve is damaged, it is common to replace it with an artificial component, via cardio-vascular surgery. The goal of the designer of the artificial valve is one which best achieves the function and performance of the natural valve it replaces; some of these desirable qualities include <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>: good durability, a low pressure drop and opening pressure, and the creation of minimal flow disturbances.</p><p>Artifical valves can contain either mechanical or flexible leaflets which open and close to control blood flow. Although the former are more durable, their rigid geometry causes significant disturbances in the flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, leading to complications such as haeomolysis and thrombosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. By contrast, flexible valves give good haemodynamic performance and have a lower pressure drop <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and a lower level of leakage <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. However, they suffer from high bending stresses during operation, along with calcification of valve leaflets. The design and development of improved artificial flexible valves is still therefore an active field of research.</p><p>In earlier work <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> we used our design toolkit to investigate the design of mechanical valves; this activity has since been extended to flexible valves. The work described in this paper on the toolkit is complemented by fuller accounts of the numerical model <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and results for several numerical experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> given elsewhere.</p><p>The valve leaflet can be viewed as a moving boundary that directly governs the local fluid dynamics of the flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Conversely, the unsteady motion of the blood and its associated pressure forces influence the motion of the leaflet; thus, the two motions are inextricably linked.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Modelling The Valve</head><p>We model the heart valve in two dimensions by taking a slice through the aorta directly through the centre of a leaflet cusp. A valve leaflet which is symmetric about the aortic centreline is then created in a way similar to other 2D studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11]</ref>. Naturally, this 2D approximation will not capture the stress distribution over all of the leaflet, especially the high stress regions at the commissures <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. However 3D studies observe other areas of high stress during coaption (snapping together to the closed position) of the leaflets, and at the attachment point; these areas are captured using our 2D model <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, along with features such as snap through (changing from a convex to concave shape) and its effect on the transient stress distribution. This feature was first highlighted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and is thought to play an important role in valve durability.</p><p>In the fluid dynamics, a 2D model inhibits the simulation of complex out-of-plane vortical structures and swirling flows; however, these features are more significant for wall shear stress distribution and localised fluid dynamic effects (stasis and shearing effects) rather than overall valve dynamics.</p><p>Clearly, our model of a rigid straight tube is a gross simplification of the true compliant complex curving aorta, although the housing of the artificial valve is rigid and hence no compliance effect is observed through the valve housing. Experiments have further shown that the rigid tube approximation has a minimal effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> on valve dynamics, but the effect of the sinus cavity in the aorta warrants further investigation; we return to this point below in § 5.</p><p>In this work, the leaflet is modelled as a linked collection of N rigid dynamic elements in a 2D plane (typically, N = 12), with each element being connected to its neighbor via a frictionless pivot. If θi is the angle at the ith pivot, then the configuration of the leaflet may be described as {θi; i = 1 . . . N } (a visualization of the leaflet is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). The leaflet's material properties are simulated by assigning specific masses and lengths to the elements and by fitting springs and dampers with stiffness and damping coefficients Ki and Ci to the pivots. These devices approximate both the flexibility of the leaflet and the damping due to the fluid moving around it. Using this model, the motion of the leaflet can be reduced to that of an n-tuple pendulum whose equation of motion may be integrated using a 4th-order Runge-Kutta routine <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. We also calculate the stress acting on the valve as it opens and closes using a simple thin shell bending theory which relates the stress to the local radius of curvature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Modelling The Flow</head><p>The blood flow is modelled using a panel method <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16]</ref> inviscid flow solver, which offers shorter run times than more realistic solvers such as Navier-Stokes since only the bounding surfaces of the domain need to be discretized. We study two models with separate domains: an infinite domain model, where fluid is allowed to flow both above and below the leaflet (similar to a flapping flag), and an aortic domain model, which models the arterial wall using a conformal mapping that maps the internal domain (a channel of fixed width) to the upper half complex plane.</p><p>The boundary condition along the leaflet surface is that of zero-normal flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. If n is a unit vector normal to the surface, then this can be written in the Neumann formulation as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(∇φ − V0 − v l − Ω × r) • n = 0.<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Here, φ is the total velocity potential of the surrounding fluid, V0 is the translational velocity of a coordinate system containing the flexible leaflet surface and v l is the kinematic velocity of the leaflet surface in the coordinate system. The fourth term accounts for the rotation of the coordinate system.</p><p>The second boundary condition (at infinity) requires that the flow's disturbance far from the leaflet surface decays to zero. It is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">lim |R−R 0 |→∞ ∇φ = 0 (2)</formula><p>where R is the displacement vector of the inertial frame and R0 the moving coordinate system.</p><p>The additional physical constraint of conservation of vorticity is introduced to model the amount of circulation generated around the leaflet surface. Using the Kutta-Joukowski condition and Kelvin's circulation theorem, all vorticity generated along the leaflet is convected into the free-stream away from the leaflet's trailing edge to form an unsteady vortex wake.</p><p>The flow is coupled to the leaflet motion via the timedependent pressure field which is calculated from the flow velocity using the unsteady Bernoulli equation. We find that, using a sub-cycling method and novel precondition matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> in the calculation of the flow, the simulations of valve leaflet motion are obtained in near real-time. This is desirable, since one of the goals of the toolkit is the rapid trialling of different leaflets. The representation of the leaflet is sufficiently general to allow for the straightforward selection of different material properties and geometries by the valve designer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DESIGN AND ANALYSIS TOOLKIT 4.1 Development Environment</head><p>We have built our leaflet design and analysis toolkit using IRIS Explorer <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr">18]</ref>, whose users create applications by connecting together modules via a visual programming interface (part of this interface is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). The application can be edited by changing or replacing modules, and functionality can be added by creating new modules, as we have done here. Applications can be saved from the toolkit (along with all of their current parameter settings) for re-use at a later point. In addition, any set of modules can be collected together into a module group, which can have a simplified interface that incorporates controls from the constituent modules (see Color Plate (i) for an example). Most of the modules described below are groups which incorporate the extra modules written for this work together with some of the modules from the default set. Examples of the latter include Render, the generic 3D display module and NAGAdvectAnimate, the particle tracing module which makes use <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> of ODE solvers from the NAG numerical library. Building our toolkit in an framework like IRIS Explorer (rather than writing the package from scratch) means that applications are easily customized through the replacement or addition of modules. Thus we found that, although we were looking at two distinct domain models, the modular approach meant that, with some judicious design decisions, many of the modules could be shared between the two models. Again, useful alternative approaches such as different solvers could be explored by writing them as modules and interchanging them in a particular application network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Modules In The Toolkit</head><p>The two modules LeafletProperties and InitCon allow the user to alter the material characteristics and geometry of the new leaflet design. In the former, the user can set values for each coefficient Ki and C i (see § 3.1), while the pivot angles θ i and their initial time derivativesθi can be set individually via the latter module (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1)</ref>.</p><p>The information about the leaflet is passed from these modules to FlexDynFlowSolv, which solves the coupled equations for the leaflet motion and fluid flow using the method outlined in § 3 above. Because we found that the time taken for the calculation of a new leaflet geometry and flow-field is often less than the time taken by the Render module to display the geometry, the module actually outputs new results every kth time-step, where k is a number set by the user via the module control panel.</p><p>Finally, post-processing of the results is performed by ViewFlow, which provides information about the flow around the leaflets in the form of vector arrows, streamlines and vortex wake surface plots. In addition, FlexFloPost produces 3D curvature and rate of change of curvature surface plots, while</p><p>AnimateLeaflet produces a movie of the leaflet opening and closing.</p><p>We show a screen shot of the AnimateLeaflet module in Color Plate (i). It is made up of several modules grouped together, including Render, which provides the large display window on the right of its control panel. The other widgets allow the user to select the starting and finishing timesteps for the animation, along with the number of times the sequence is to be repeated. In the display, each leaflet is colored according to its local radius of curvature. It should be noted that the arterial wall above and below the leaflets has been introduced here (and in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, below) only for visual effect; in fact, as noted above in § 3.1, the calculation assumes the artery has a fixed width (we return to this point below, in § 5). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Using The Toolkit</head><p>In this subsection, we illustrate the use of our toolkit with some representative displays-further examples are presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Color Plate (ii) uses particle tracing to show the flow past a pair of leaflets in the infinite domain model, about 40 ms after the valve has started to open. In the image, the flow is from left to right, and the two leaflets are hinged at their top and bottom edges respectively. At their free edges (on the right), the colored spheres represent the strength of the vorticity shed into the wake at the leaflet trailing edge. Each sphere is placed at a vortex origin; it is colored according to the value of the vorticity, while its radius is proportional to the absolute vorticity. The visualization shows that the vorticity within the flow is confined to a core region which is the starting vortex originating from the leaflets' trailing edge.</p><p>A corresponding result for the aortic domain model (again, about 40 ms after valve opening) is shown in Color Plate (iii) where the flow is visualized using a velocity vector plot. Here, we have introduced the arterial wall above and below the leaflets as a visual cue to show the width of the channel. In Color Plate (iv), we again focus on the vorticity for the same pair of leaflets at a different step in the simulation. The vorticity is displayed using contours, which once again show its concentration around the trailing edges of the leaflets.</p><p>Finally, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows a pair of leaflets in the aortic domain for a closed valve-note their characteristic shape. The leaflets are colored according to curvature (and this coloring changes dynamically as the valve opens and closes, in the display provided by the AnimateLeaflet module). The radius of curvature is inversely proportional to the local stress on the valve, and can be used in quantitative comparisons with experimental results for real valves <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSIONS. FURTHER WORK</head><p>A modular visualization system has been used as the basis of a toolkit for the design of flexible heart valves. The modular nature of the toolkit allows for application to different models; we have examined flow in an infinite domain and in a channel reminiscent of the aorta. The designer can describe a valve leaflet in terms of its shape and mechanical properties (via a finite number of parameters), and then ask for its behaviour in a flow field. Our simplified computational fluid dynamics and leaflet description mean that this calculation can be carried out at interactive rates, which enables the user to examine several designs in a single session.</p><p>Further work in this area will focus on improving the realism of the model for the valve in the aortic channel. In particular, it has been known for some time that circulation in the three sinuses in the aorta downstream from the aortic valve plays an important role in its behaviour. (These sinuses are illustrated-but not incorporated into the valve model-in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> and Color Plate (i).) The present studies have restricted themselves to a fixed-width channel model for simplicity, but extensions to incorporate the effect of the sinus cavity (or, at least, that of the vortex within it) are possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Color Plate i: Control panel for the AnimateLeaflet module, showing the widgets that allow the user to select the timesteps for the animation (left) and the display window (right).</p><p>Color Plate ii: Flow streamlines during valve opening for the infinite domain model.
