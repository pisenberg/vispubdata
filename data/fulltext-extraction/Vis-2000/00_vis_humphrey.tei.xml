				<p>Richly expressive information visualizations are difficult to design and rarely found. Few software tools can generate multidimensional visualizations at all, let alone incorporate artistic detail. Although, it is a great efficiency to reuse these visualizations with new data, the associated artistic detail is rarely reusable. The Relational Visualization Notation is a new technique and toolkit for specifying highly expressive graphical representations of data without traditional programming. We seek to discover the accessible power of this notation-both its graphical expressiveness and its ease of re-use. Towards this end we have used the system to reconstruct Minard&apos;s visualization of Napoleon&apos;s Russian campaign of 1812. The resulting image is strikingly similar to the original, and the design is straightforward to construct. Furthermore, the design permitted by the notation can be directly reused to visualize Hitler&apos;s WWII defeat before Moscow. This experience leads us to believe that artistically expressive visualizations can be made to be reusable.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The graphic depiction of information is as old as history-indeed it defines recorded history. Our earliest ancestors speak to us through cave drawings of deer and horses, and stone-etched images of the hunt. Through the millennia, pictures, maps and paintings have become increasingly sophisticated and have spawned languages, but have largely remained concrete-using space to represent only space. The 18 th century heralded a new way to communicate when J.H. Lambert plotted soil temperature and other observations against time, and William Playfair published a volume of line-graphs showing wages, prices, trade deficits, etc. against time. It was here they created the roots of modern visualizations-space representing abstract information.</p><p>Today, visualizations are graphical representations of information that enhance people's ability to communicate, analyze and reason, and they appear in myriad forms: from simple plots and charts to multi-dimensional color maps and beyond. Minard's well-known visualization, shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, stands as a brilliant graphical representation of Napoleon's disastrous 1812 campaign against Russia <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. It contains formal data, such as the number of troops that arrived in a particular city or the temperature on a particular day, or the location of the city on the map. There are graphic components, such as thick line segments, written text and numbers, vertical lines, and the map layout. And there are relationships, such as line thickness indicating troop size, shading indicating advance or retreat, names representing cities, and vertical distance encoding the temperature.</p><p>In addition, this visualization also contains nonformal information, which is not only artistic but plays an important role. It sets the context for interpreting the visualization by suggesting the Russian geography and the historic significance via the rivers and titles respectively. In addition, the advancement of the troops is indicated by a connection between cities, even though the time and direction of the movement are implied only by the line's continuity and Napoleon's devastating losses. Nonformal information, as we will see later, significantly affects both the artistic expression and the reusability of the visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1 Napoleon's march on Moscow</head><p>Computer-generated multi-dimensional visualizations like this are rare-few tools are capable of the rich graphical expression required and many are difficult to use <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Nevertheless, a couple of systems have reconstructed components of Minard's graphic. Sage integrates 10 data attributes into a map-like display that shows troop movement, troop size, temperature, important battles and dates <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. It uses color to show temperature and foregoes the line graph. Yet in these recreations, much of the geography is missing and the troop path is blocky and discontinuous. It carries little of the artistic brilliance of the original. Mathematica <ref type="bibr">(tm)</ref> has been used to incorporate the troop path and rivers, although temperatures, troop numbers, city labels and other important details were omitted <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The Relational Visualization Notation is a new graphical notation that allows users to specify visualization designs without the use of programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Programming here means the expression of procedural or control-oriented constructs, either textually or graphically. We seek to discover the accessible power of the Relational Visualization Notation--to what extent can complex, graphically expressive visualizations be easily specified and reused?</p><p>Towards this end we have used the notation to specify a design for temperature-linked troop movements, and we have used that design to automatically generate a reconstruction of Minard's Napoleonic visualization. Like the original, it contains a continuous troop path that is shaded for advancing and retreating troops. Cities and troop numbers appear on a map of Russia, and a line graph showing temperature is linked to the cities. We also show the steps that a user might take to create such a visualization in order to gives us a feel for the usability of the tool. Furthermore, we find that the constructed design is sufficiently general to be able to visualize Hitler's WWII defeat before Moscow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">OVERVIEW OF NOTATION</head><p>The Relational Visualization Notation (RVN) is composed of three main parts: semantic data models, graphic relations and design diagrams. The semantic data modeling component provides facilities for describing, storing and retrieving information according to the relational model. It is not unlike a relational database. Each graphic relation visually represents one information relation. They define the information and graphical models of the visualization as well as the transformation between them. Design diagrams combine multiple information and graphic relations into a visualization design specification. All of the components are supported with an integrated set of direct manipulation design tools, called the Relational Visualization Toolkit (RVT).</p><p>Graphic relations are defined by an information schema, a graphic schema and a set of bindings. The information schema describes, in a single relation, the information to be presented by the graphic relation. The graphic schema is a template made of boxes, circles, lines and other graphic figures including novel elements, such as graphic iteration and graphic selection. It defines the visualization's visual structure very much like a parameterized icon <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The bindings are algebraic expressions, not unlike those found in spreadsheets, that encode the relationships between the information schema and the graphical schema. Algebraic expressions are a successful technique for enabling people without programming skills to specify computational functionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Relational Visualization Notation design diagrams are directed, acyclic graphs that combine several source relations to produce several output graphic relations. The nodes represent source data, relational operators (such as project, select and join), and reusable, hierarchically nested designs. Design diagrams may be used independently to produce a visualization, or used as a component of more complex visualizations.</p><p>The toolkit used in this article is implemented in Smalltalk/V on a Mac 520 as an integrated environment that supports the design, development, evaluation and production of visualizations. The Relational Visualization Toolkit takes a design and a set of source relations as input and produces a visualization as output. The visualization consists of an ordered series of primitive graphical objects, such as rectangles, lines and text. Rendering the objects produces an image. The toolkit and examples are available at http://www.iviz.com/rvn. A newer, more advanced Linux/X-based version of the toolkit includes color, design libraries and greater functionality and is also available through the website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RELATIONAL MODEL</head><p>Minard's graphic is based on data that describe the movement of troops between cities-data that can be described by two relations: The Napoleon relation describes the movements of troops between cities and the Temperature relation describes the temperature on different days. Each tuple describes a battalion that traveled from one place to another on a particular date. In the schema of <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, troops is the number of soldiers, fromPlace and toPlace the origin and destination city names, fromDate date the troops left the city, advanced is true if the troops were advancing and false if they were retreating, and losing is the number of soldiers that perished along the way. The data for the relation are taken from Minard's hand-drawn picture- <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> shows three tuples derived from it.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Troop Movement Path</head><p>The first step in producing the troop movement path is to convert the city names of the Napoleon relation into map coordinates. The first join of Russia and Napoleon adds the coordinates of the fromPlace and the second adds the coordinates of the toPlace. Join automatically prefixes replicated attribute names with left_ and right_, so that left_x is the x-value of the destination city, and so forth. The result is projected to just the coordinates of the origin and destination cities, the number of departing troops, the number perished and whether they were advancing or retreating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2 RVN Design of Minard's graphic</head><p>The movement graphic relation, shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, draws lines of varying thickness between the cities. Input attributes x, y, tx, and ty stand for the coordinates of the origin and destination cities.</p><p>Troops, losing and advancing have the same meaning as described above. The graphic schema contains three guidelines that define the shape of the connecting line segment, and a polygon that becomes the segment itself. A polygon is used because the width of an ordinary line segment is constant throughout itself. The longest line segment is named axis and directly connects the origin and destination cities. The two others are fromLine and toLine, and they represent the path segment width at the origin and destination, respectively. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">City Circles</head><p>When two troop movement segments meet at a city, they leave an angular gap because their ends are perpendicular to the direction of movement, and possibly of different widths. These gaps can be smoothed by placing circles over them. A circle is needed whenever two or more segments meet at a city-terminal cities retain their perpendicular edges. The circle must cover the larger of either the troops that arrive or depart. (More troops leave Smorgoni than arrive, so we cannot always assume that arrivals are greater than departures.) To shade the circle correctly, the troops at a city should be considered advancing if either they arrived by advancing or they are departing by advancing.</p><p>To compute these circles, troop movement data is projected into two distinct relations, one containing the departure cities, and the other containing arrivals. These are joined to find all of the cities which have troops both arriving and departing. The map operator assigns the correct advancing value, and the summarization computes the maximum number of troops traveling into or out of each city.</p><p>The new advancing and troop size data are joined to Russia to determine the city positions. The result is then projected to the coordinates of the circle, its width and whether the troops are advancing or not. The cityCircle graphic relation uses this information to produce one circle of the appropriate diameter and shading for each city.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Temperature</head><p>The last component of Minard's graphic is the temperature scale that shows the freezing weather that the soldiers endured. The scale plots temperature on a vertical axis, while the horizontal axis shows both space and time. The temperature points are positioned horizontally according to the location of the city where the measurement was taken. Because the troops consistently retreated westward, the horizontal axis also plots time, from right to left, although the temporal divisions are not uniform.</p><p>An vertical axis for plotting temperature, shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, is created in graphic source BZtemp. It outputs the minimum and maximum data values by binding the outputs to the text values of the end points. The axis source also outputs the physical positions of the end points. These four values are used later to plot the temperature by linearly interpolating the values between the axis endpoints. Although the horizontal lines could have been produced automatically, in this case they have been drawn by hand. Notice, also, that the graphic relation has been scrolled; the source is created relative to the map of Russia so that they will overlap.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 5 Temperature scale graphic source</head><p>As shown in the main design, the temperature data is joined by date with the troop movement data where the coordinates of the departure cities are known. This computation attaches the temperatures to the cities where the troops were at on a particular day. The result is projected to date, temperature and city location.</p><p>The vertical axis data is paired with this and the result is the visualized as distinct data points. The data points are plotted with the tempPoint graphic relation, shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. It accepts data that describes each data point, that is, the temperature, date, coordinates of the city, and the four values produced by the temperature axis. The graphic relation contains three objects: a small ellipse named point, a text object called dateline, and a vertical line called column. These represent the data point, the date and the connection to the city, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 6 Temperature data point graphic relation</head><p>The center of ellipse point is placed according to the x position of the city and the linear interpolation of the temperature against the axis. The date string is taken directly from the date value. The top of the text object is positioned below the ellipse. The horizontal midpoint of the text is taken from the midpoint of the ellipse. The endpoints of the vertical line are taken from the coordinates of the city and the data point. The line will be vertical because both xcoordinates are the same. The output attributes are bound to the center of the ellipse. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows these arithmetic relationships.</p><p>The tempPoints graphic relation generates the physical locations of the data points as output. These points are sorted in right-to-left order along the axis, with each point receiving a unique sequence number. The points are then paired each to its adjacent neighbor by joining the data to itself over the sequence values-the pairs are the end points of the line graph segments. The data are projected to pairs of coordinates, which are visualized as line segments. The connected segments form the line graph. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">RESULT</head><p>Using source data describing Napoleon's movements and the design outlined in Section 3, the Relational Visualization Toolkit produces the screen image shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. The result closely replicates Minard's original. The troop path is very similar-it follows the same course with the same deflections at cities. It has the same shading for advancing and retreating movements. The troop path branches similarly to the original, and rejoins it correctly. It also smoothly connects the cities.</p><p>The temperature graph mimics the original, including the axis labels, and the dates. The troop population labels are visible and have the same values as the original. The figure titles and geography are also the same, but these are specified directly by the user. The user has complete control over their appearance.</p><p>Even the cities are placed by the user using direct manipulation; there is no need to determine or specify their coordinates.</p><p>Several differences to the original are apparent. The reconstruction contains additional "cities" that mark where the army changed course-cities that do not appear on the original. For clarity, the original situates the retreat from Moscow directly south of Moscow itself, whereas the reconstruction layers the assault and retreat on top of each other. The reconstruction also has an extra temperature value for the 24th of October. The extra value is needed because the original temperature graph deflects at that point, but there is no corresponding city.</p><p>It is worthwhile to consider the general ease or difficulty of producing such an image. A reasonable estimate of complexity is to count up the number of elements the user must specify to produce the design. Such counts appear in  The ability to construct relational queries by assembling primitive operators is also needed. Although this skill is common among information specialists and people who work with relational databases, many others do not have it. Nevertheless, this skill is strongly related to that of knowing the structure of the data. For example, a "join" makes sense only when there is a logical connection among relations. People who understand their data, but have limited querying skills should be more willing to extend their knowledge and have an easier time doing so because such skills are task-specific <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>The utility of a visualization toolkit is measured not only in its effectiveness for a particular design, but also its ability to be used for previously unseen data. In 1941, Hitler attempted "Operation Barbarossa," a full-scale assault on the Northern, Central and Although the data were not in a relational form, extensive interpretation has transformed them into a relation with the same schema as Napoleon's..Applying this data to the Minard design in place of the Napoleon relation yields the image of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 9</ref>. The movement of troops is much more complicated here, with several outbranchings and rejoinders. Some troops, like those going to Kiev, left the central Russian theater and did not return. Nevertheless, the new visualization clearly shows the encirclements of Minsk and Smolensk and the rapid successes that the Wehrmacht enjoyed until it reached Moscow. After a long siege on Moscow and its environs, the German forces eventually withdrew, taking considerable losses.</p><p>The functionality of the Minard design was not modified in order to produce this diagram. The relational design is the same as for Napoleon's data, and all of the graphic relations are the same. In fact the visualization is produced from the same design file. Several circumstantial changes have been made however. New cities needed to be added to the map of Russia, to account for those appearing in the data. These were created by copying and renaming existing cities; no new bindings or functional units were created. The Russian geography was updated to correspond to contemporary 1942 maps and the titles were changed. In effect, only non-formal "decorative" information components were updated</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">ALTERNATE EXAMPLE</head><p>It is educational to consider a second example that contains nothing more than lines and text to show how artistic fluidity can be "lost" in the translation.   To replicate this class of images I modeled the data with three relations. The first is a "trend" relation that indicates what percentage of total record sales was had by a particular trend in a particular year. For example, in 1966 "Bubblegum" held 5% of the total sales. Next, an "influence" relation indicates crossover years when one trend created or influenced another, such as British Invasion influencing the development of PopRock in 1966.</p><p>The third relation described the artists themselves. This relation was problematic, as it is only representative (many musicians that sold records are omitted) and imprecise (under what conditions does an artist in a trend find themselves in a second trend as a continuation or as a new beginning?) I opted to use this relation to denote an artist's "paths" through trends and years. For example, the Miracles followed a path that started in Uptown R&amp;B <ref type="bibr">(1960)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1961)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1962)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1963)</ref> continued through Produced Soul <ref type="bibr">(1964)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1965)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1966)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1967)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1968)</ref> and finished in <ref type="bibr">PopSoul (1969</ref><ref type="bibr">PopSoul ( -1970</ref>.</p><p>Applying data derived from the original produces the result of <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>. Overall, the visualization has the same flowing shape and the same data in roughly the same locations. The trends are very similar, matching the overall layout, with a few anomalies. The Surf trend should close in 1966, but it appears to feed into Pop Rock. Some sparse areas result because only about 2/3 of the original data are used. Also, the use of straight lines rather than curves begins to reduce the feeling of fluidity.</p><p>The musicians' paths, however, have come off somewhat worse. Their entries tend to be ordered differently from the original. In some cases path lines cross, or paths that cross streams fail to connect. The straight lines spoil the flow of the paths through the trends.</p><p>Perhaps the most disappointing feature of this visualization is the text layout. In any graphics system, text layout is problematic, and in portable systems the problem is severe. In this case the visualization was designed with an X-graphics based tool, but was rendered in PostScript in order to achieve very high resolution.</p><p>The toolkit does not have the notion of curved (or even angled) text-paths, with letters that swing and bend to suit the line. All of the angled text labeling was achieved through complex subqueries that mapped single characters to paths. Furthermore, only a few fonts are available in the toolkit, and none of these comes even close to the crisp, clean hand-lettered labels of the original. In fact, because fonts do not scale in this type of graphics systems (12 point is 12 point regardless of the view space) the image had to be rendered at 9600x4096 pixels to achieve the resolution and clarity of the original.</p><p>On the other hand, the visualization is now reusable. New data describing non-musical information can be supplied to this visualization because the selected data models do not contain any information about musicians, or trends in music. The main concepts built into this visualization are the horizontal time scale, the vertical numeric scale and the trend values for a particular year (much like an ordinary time-series). What distinguishes this visualization are the depictions of influences among trends, the paths of entities that comprise those trends, and the fluid way in which these are presented.</p><p>Candidate possibilities for reusing this visualization include applying it to modern music trends, or to the existing trends with more up-to-date data. Alternatively, it could be used to represent phases are art history: realism, romanticism, impressionism, surrealism, cubism, modernism and so forth. The contributing artists would appear within their trends, illuminating who performed in which era, and who contributed to the rise and transformation of artistic periods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSION</head><p>There are two key observations that we can gather from this experiment. The first is that the reusability of a visualization is affected by its formal and nonformal components. Nonformal components limit reusability by implying a context that may not accommodate new data. In our example (as occurs in may others) the titles and backgrounds had to be changed. Formal information as well can affect reusability because the model may be <ref type="bibr">1972 1973 1974 1971 1967 1968 1969 1970 1964 1965 1966 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1955 1954</ref>  The second observation is that the artistic expressiveness of a visualization may be influenced by formal as well as nonformal components. Nonformal components are always considered decorative rather than functional because they have no necessary relationship to the applied data. They enhance the visualization by providing necessary context for the user, such as a background map or a title. However, when the toolkit is sufficiently expressive, formal design elements can be created that produce the desired artistic effects, as was done with the city circles.</p><p>Enhancing both artistic expressiveness and reusability appears to be a contradiction because nonformal artistic elements lead to visualizations that are not reusable outside their implied contexts. However, our conclusion is that highly expressive and reusable visualizations are possible when the toolkit allows the user to transform many of the nonformal elements into formal elements. By substituting expressive formal elements for nonformal ones, reusability can be improved without sacrificing artistic detail.</p><p>As our second example shows, artistic expressiveness is not accounted for merely by providing a basis set of graphical operators. Although such a set makes all graphical forms possible, it hardly makes them convenient. The toolkit could (and should be) be augmented with more powerful text handling facilities because there must be some provision for making typical combinations easy in the same way that modern image processing tools come with rich libraries of graphical effects tools.</p><p>The Relational Visualization Notation is sufficiently expressive to reconstruct Minard's graphic in detail, although it needs a richer set of tools to handle the fluid text of Garofalo's. The expressiveness integrates formal elements, such as the troop path and temperature graph, and nonformal elements, such as the titles and background map. The richness of expression arrives without traditional programming structures. Rather, the user creates the visual elements directly and connects them with algebraic and relational expressions. Ultimately, the goal is not to reconstruct existing visualizations, but to develop reusable ones. The visualizations of Hitler's Central Russian campaign and Garofalo's trends in modern music demonstrate that rich, expressive and reusable visualizations can be created from relational data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 Figure 4</head><label>34</label><figDesc>Movement graphic transformationThe fromLine and toLine are perpendicular to direction of troop movement, are proportional in length to the origin and destination populations, and are centered on the axis itself.

Relations refers only to the schema of the Napoleon and Temperature relations; the data are not part of the design. The graphic sources are the hand-drawn map of Russia and the temperature axis. Although the map of Russia generates information, the user did not have to specify the actual city coordinates. The relational operators refer to the specific project, select, and join operators (and others) used in the design. The graphic relations are the design components that generate output. The graphic objects are the rectangles, lines and text that appear in graphic relations. Binding expressions refer to the algebraic statements that relate schema attributes to graphic object attributes.</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="2">Qty Item</cell><cell>Description</cell></row><row><cell>2</cell><cell>Relations</cell><cell>External source data</cell></row><row><cell>2</cell><cell>Graphic sources</cell><cell>Map of Russia and the temperature</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>axis</cell></row><row><cell>16</cell><cell cols="2">Relational operators Project, select, join, etc.</cell></row><row><cell>5</cell><cell>Graphic relations</cell><cell>Troop movements, city circles, labels</cell></row><row><cell>20</cell><cell>Graphic objects</cell><cell>Rectangles, text, lines, circles</cell></row><row><cell>35</cell><cell cols="2">Binding expressions Relating troops to sizes, etc.</cell></row></table><note>Some specific skills are required to produce an RVN design. The user must be able to specify algebraic expressions, a skill that the Figure 8 Reconstruction of Minard's Graphic widespread use of spreadsheets is making universal. The user must be able to design and specify relational data models. Such a skill is more rare, but nevertheless justified because it is reasonable to expect that people who wish to visualize multi- relational data will have an understanding of the structure of that data. A user who attempts to visualize (or statistically analyze or otherwise manipulate) data without understanding the data model is asking for trouble.</note></figure>
