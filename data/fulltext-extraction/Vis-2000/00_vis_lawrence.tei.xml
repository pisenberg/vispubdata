<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>We take the view that scientific visualization is more than the graphical display of data. It is the process of understanding a physical system's behavior by developing mental models of that behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Numerical modeling, simulation, and data display tools are used to bring the details of the system into the user's mental grasp. In this paper, we explore new methods of scientific visualization using a visual/haptic interface, where some aspects of the data are displayed graphically and other aspects are displayed haptically by applying forces to a stylus held in a user's hand. The haptic interface also provides the main means of interacting with the data through direct tactile sensing and manipulation of the data display. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows the visual/haptic interface used in the development of rendering modes described in this paper. The visual component is a SGI ONYX Reality 2 running AVS/Express. The haptic interface consists of 5 linear actuators mounted on a hexagonal ring, meeting each end of a stylus held in the user's hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. This provides 5 degrees of mechanical freedom (5 DOF) in motion sensing and forces applied to the hand. (Only rotation about the axis of the stylus is neither sensed nor controlled). The translational workspace is a sphere approximately 40 cm in diameter; and the rotational DOF are each capable of  dered using a closed force feedback loop around each rod <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and Cartesian position is calculated on-line from rod length measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Although this interface has unique capabilities, the haptic rendering modes described in this paper are not specific to this interface, and any haptic interface which provides the same DOF could be used instead. Other haptic devices have been used to augment conventional visualization. Avila and Sobierajski <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> use a 3 DOF interface in a similar manner. Hughes and Forrest use a tactile mouse, which adds 1 scalar quantity of information to the perceptualization. Our approach adds the ability to interact with the data in orientation as well as in translation DOF, which is particularly useful with vector fields.</p><p>Our initial experience with combined visual/haptic data rendering is that such an interface works best when the haptic component is treated as a synergistic companion to visual display. That is, not to replace the visual display of a data set, but to augment this display with reinforcing or disambiguating information through the user's hands. Each mode of data display has its strengths. Human vision is unparalleled for 2-dimensional pattern understanding, and for identifying solid objects (surfaces) in uncluttered 3-dimensional spaces. Vision is less adept at understanding data which fills volumes continuously. This is true for scalar-valued data, and even more so for data that has vector or tensor values. Haptic perception, in contrast, is rather poor at determining global shape of spatial patterns, but it has complementary capabilities in discerning local properties, such as surface curvature, vector orientation, and mechanical properties such as viscosity and stiffness.</p><p>We have previously developed visual/haptic modes for scientific visualization to show that the use of haptics can help the user to more easily understand cluttered graphical displays of streamlines in an electromagnetic field <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In this, the appropriate combination of haptic and visual rendering can help the user to simultaneously focus on local behavior (e.g. a single streamline) while retaining a global orientation from a field of many other streamlines. However, care must be taken in designing combined haptic/visual modes; if done inappropriately, the resulting combined display can be more confusing than the graphics display alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Augmenting graphical visualization with a multiple DOF haptic interface also extends data display to allow direct manipulation of the data. A 5 DOF haptic interface, such as that shown in <ref type="figure">Figure</ref> 1, replaces the 2 DOF mouse and enables the user to "grab" onto the data set and manipulate it for better viewing precisely and efficiently in 5 DOF (3 translations and 2 rotations simultaneously). As on a conventional mouse, buttons on the haptic stylus can be depressed to select data to manipulate (object picking) or to change rendering modes by selecting buttons or menu items on the screen.</p><p>In this paper, the focus of visual/haptic rendering is the exploration of fluid dynamics models. In particular, understanding the structure of shock surfaces and vortex cores in the flow about a supersonic waverider is used to motivate combined visual/haptic rendering modes. A waverider aircraft uses the principle of flow containment to provide enhanced lift. A shock wave originates along the entire leading edge of the body, containing higher pressure flow between the compression surface (the underside of the body) and the shock wave. Thus the body is "riding" on the lift generated by the higher pressure volume beneath the aircraft.</p><p>Finite element models are used to solve for the flow characteristics about the waverider. Once the data set is computed, it is displayed using traditional graphical visualization tools such as streamlines to indicate flow direction and color to represent flow speed. Isosurfaces are often used to visualize shock surfaces where flow quantities vary abruptly. An efficient visualization environ- ment would allow the user to quickly understand salient features in the flow, and to easily set parameters so that definitive graphical displays of this understanding can then be created. Such understanding and documentation of flow characteristics enable rapid design changes to improve the performance of the vehicle. In particular, secondary shocks branching off the main shock surface and leaks from the high pressure volume around the edge of the wings (causing vortices) are undesirable behaviors in the flow pattern. We focus on these flow features in this paper. Sections 2 and 3 discuss combined visual/haptic rendering modes suited to fast visualization of shock structure and vortices, respectively. In Section 4, we discuss implementation of these modes, with emphasis on issues that are critical for high-quality, interactive visualization. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 5. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> exhibits a shock wave on the underside of the waverider using a volume rendering, with color indicating density. Shock surfaces are located where the density of the flow changes abruptly, seen in the figure as surfaces created by abrupt color change. In waverider design, a body shape is sought which can produce a smooth primary shock wave with minimal secondary shocks. Visualization modes must allow the user to easily determine the shape, location, and strength of shock surfaces.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">α k ρ k ρ k-1 D k k-1 P P k ρ ρ ρ F F ε ε &gt; ε ρ</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Shock Structure Visualization</head><p>Various methods exist for the detection of shocks, including normal Mach number <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, directional derivatives thresholding <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, weighted density gradient <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and others (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.) These visualization methods involve displaying the isosurface where the numerical function being computed reaches or exceeds a particular value. However, the shape of an isosurface varying throughout a volume can be difficult to understand from the 2dimensional graphical display, with the clarity of the shape of the isosurface depending upon the view angle, lighting, and shading. In addition, the desired shock surface may not be visible at all unless the iso-values or parameters in the detection function are chosen correctly-often a tedious trial and error process. Strong secondary shocks branching off the main shock surface indicate a suboptimal body shape. When sliced on a plane, this type of plot is similar in appearance to physically obtained Schlieren images of shock waves <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> (although the latter are due to projection onto the view plane.) Weaker secondary shocks are difficult to see, especially since they are often contained inside the main shock isosurface. Transparent rendering can help, but correct parameter choices must be made to ensure all the structures of interest actually appear. Since haptic perception of edges and roughness is very acute, </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">¥ ¦ ¥ § © ¥ ¥ ¥ ¦ ¥ § © ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ § © ¥ ¥ ¥ ¦ ¥ § © ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ § ¨ ¥ ¦ ¥ ! ! ! ! !! ! !

This can prompt adjustment to viewing parameters to bring the secondary shock into clear view.</p><p>We describe a haptic rendering mode based on the gradient in the density. When the magnitude of the gradient is less than some threshold:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">¥ ¥ § ¨ ¥ ¦ ¥ # $</formula><p>, then no force is rendered.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T (</head><p>. Hence the strength of the shock is displayed to the user via the magnitude of the density gradient, which is felt as abrupt and strong forces guiding the user's hand to the lower density side of the surface.</p><p>As the user explores a volume with the haptic stylus, free motion is allowed in regions where the density gradient is small. Within the shock region, the forces applied to the user result in behavior similar to a ball on a hill. As a shock region (high gradient region) is entered from the high density side (from top to bottom in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>), the haptic stylus is drawn to the low density side of the shock wave. In contrast, the shock surface can only be penetrated from the low density side by pushing against the rendered force. This directional rendering of shock waves allows users to easily understand which regions represent high and low density without cluttering the visual display with additional data. In addition, no force opposes motion along the shock surface (normal to the density gradient), making the shock surface a virtual mechani-cal surface that can be followed with the hands as well as the eyes if the user is on the low density side. Our method of shock wave rendering, in essence, allows surface rendering without the need to parameterize the surface off-line, providing an interactive capability not often possible with visual isosurface extraction. Further, if secondary shock waves branch off the primary shock surface (as in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>), the user will penetrate (and therefore feel) this "wall" as the main shock surface is traversed. Once the secondary shock existence and location is determined, adjustments to graphical cut planes or isosurface values may be performed to more clearly see the result.</p><p>A similar method was applied by Avila and Sobierajski <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for haptic isosurface rendering in that they direct forces in the direction of the density gradient, with magnitude proportional to density. Although computed differently, it appears that both methods provide a similar spring-like feel near the shock surface. However, since our method produces forces proportional to penetration distance as opposed to density, weaker shocks may be apparent without having to adjust rendering parameters. This may be more appropriate for initial exploration and location of regions of concern.</p><p>In combined visual/haptic rendering, a glyph (thick arrow in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>) is displayed visually on the screen to represent the location of the haptic stylus in the data set. Both the orientation and the translation of the stylus are portrayed by the glyph. As the main shock wave is traversed haptically, the glyph in the visual display moves along the isosurface representation of this shock wave. If a secondary shock is discerned, the user can depress a button on the haptic stylus to cause the haptic stylus to momentarily act as a navigation tool to allow the visual display to be zoomed in or rotated to obtain a closer visual view of the secondary shock. When the haptic display of the gradient rendering mode is resumed (upon releasing the button on the stylus), the user can then continue to explore locally the shape of the secondary shock and its relation to the main shock surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Vortex Structure Visualization</head><p>Another difficulty in understanding fluid flow data is the identification and characterization of vortices. Although the specific questions vary, generally the objective is to determine if vortical flow is present, and to understand the location, structure, and strength of any vortices found. Vortical flow is identified by kinematic rotation in the fluid. In 2D flow, this is typically easier to identify than in 3D flow, since rotation always occurs in the plane of the view. Vortices in 3D can have complex structures, making it difficult to find a viewing plane that makes the rotation clear.</p><p>Four main classes of techniques are used in 3D vortex identification and visualization. The first uses scalar measures of vortical behavior. Examples include vorticity magnitude versus pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, helicity density and normalized helicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the a c b criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and the d criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. These are used along with suitable threshold values to render volumes or surfaces of volumes which have vortical flow corresponding to the measure used. The second class uses vector information. The eigenvector method of Sujudi and Haimes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> locates vortex core lines at points where the velocity and acceleration are parallel. The higher-order method of Roth and Peikert <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> locates the vortex core lines at points where the velocity and jerk are parallel. The third class of techniques attempts to directly visualize the vector field of fluid motion using streamlines. The streamlines are seeded at an array of points, and propagated forward or backward along local vector velocity directions. When the seed points are suitably chosen, telltale helix shapes can sometimes be observed in the streamlines in vortical flow regions. The fourth class consists of curve-based methods, which extract geometrical qualities from streamlines, such as curvature center density and winding angle <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Once a suitable technique (or combination of techniques) and corresponding parameters (thresholds, seed points) have been found, vortex behavior can be understood and communicated clearly with purely visual displays. The difficulty often comes in finding just the right techniques and parameter settings for each set of data. This remains a time-consuming process.</p><p>We have been exploring the use of a haptic interface to improve the vortex visualization process. Two types of added capability have been implemented. The first is an exploratory mode where the intent is to reinforce and clarify visual vector displays (e.g. streamlines) by providing focus on the vector at the current pointer location.</p><p>The second type of capability enabled by the haptic interface is real time exploration and picking in 3D, with forces and torques applied to encourage motion toward features of interest. This ability gives the user immediate feedback on the nature of the data at the probe location, yet provides complete freedom to quickly explore interesting features and/or move to new locations.</p><p>These two capabilities are defined in more detail in the following two sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Exploratory Vortex Mode</head><p>In the exploratory vortex mode, the graphical display consists of streamlines seeded at an array of points, and the haptic stylus acts as a 3D mouse. Mimicking the stylus motion, a glyph (arrow) moves through the graphical data set displayed on the screen. A thick streamline is continuously seeded from the glyph tip, indicating the local velocity streamline (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>.) The user can freely explore the field and search for vortices. If spiral-like streamlines collapse, the user can surmise the presence of a vortex core line. Also, while the user moves through the data set, the local value of the a c b variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> is displayed numerically to the screen online. This gives further insight into vortical locations. Another option is to first highlight regions of negative a c b graphically, to point the user toward likely vortex locations. Once a candidate vortical area has been identified roughly, the user can then engage the second mode, called the vortex core identification mode. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Vortex Core Identification Mode</head><p>The vortex core identification mode is activated when the user presses one of the two buttons on the stylus. In this mode, a restoring torque is applied to the stylus to orient it along a chosen vector quantity. This vector quantity can be the vorticity, the acceleration, or the jerk. Our current implementation uses the vorticity e f is the unit vector describing the axis of rotation, normal to the plane in which lie the current and desired orientations (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>). It is desirable for the restoring torque to be stronger as one approaches a vortical region. For this reason, we scale the torque by the normalized helicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> h i 0 e f e e f e</p><p>As the user responds to the torque applied, two vector fields will be portrayed graphically: the vorticity e f (as the glyph of the stylus) and the velocity e (as the thick streamline seeded from the tip of the glyph). When e f and e are parallel, a vortex core line is present <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Although concerns about clutter in 3D visualization are generally well-founded, clutter is reduced in this case because the vorticity is portrayed by a single small arrow, as opposed to  <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>: To maintain high haptic interface refresh rates, the haptic interface is run from a DSP farm.</p><p>a second overlapping field of vector glyphs or streamlines. Also, since the orientation of the hand-held stylus is felt kinesthetically, it is easier to comprehend the relative directions of the two fields than it would be with graphical rendering alone. Concurrent to this orientation constraint, a force is also applied to the stylus in the direction described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">' 0 q e f e</formula><p>where q is a gain that is set to yield appropriate force levels. In the vicinity of a vortex, this force will tend to point towards the vortex core. For example, if the velocity is locally helical, this force points to the center of the local helix (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>.)</p><p>Initial tests with these two modes on a data set based on modified Lorenz equations show promising results. When the exploratory mode is engaged, a general understanding of the data is possible by probing with the stylus through the data set. Once candidate vortical regions are identified visually and through the use of the a b criterion, the vortex identification mode is turned on, and the stylus firmly aligns itself with the vortex core. Motion of the stylus is then constrained to the vortex core, but free in the direction tangent to it. If the vortex identification mode is engaged in areas with no vorticity, and particularly if the flow is very turbulent, rendering is vague and confusing. Here we find again that the proper combined use of visual and haptic modes, often in a particular sequential order, provides added value in understanding the data. A particular visual or haptic mode rarely makes a significant difference by itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Implementation Issues</head><p>The value of the visual/haptic modes discussed in this paper is severely reduced when the rendering is of poor quality. Rendering here refers to both the graphics and haptics interfaces. True interactivity with the data requires that changes in the graphics display resulting from user motions have latencies well below 1 sec.  <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>: DSP programming architecture.</p><p>For large data sets, this often requires a reduction in the size or resolution of the data displayed to maintain the illusion of a real object being manipulated by the user. The haptic rendering quality is dependent on an extremely low latency between sensed motions and corresponding applied forces, e.g. as the stylus orientation is moved away from the nominal position pointing along the local vector field direction. Typically, latencies below 1 msec are required to avoid poorly-damped dynamics in the haptic interface. Otherwise, annoying oscillatory behavior can mask the feeling rendered by the data.</p><p>In our current implementation, we manage the disparate computational requirements of the visual and haptic interfaces by using separate computers for each. The visual display is provided by an SGI ONYX Reality 2 running AVS/Express. One copy of the data set is imported into AVS and displayed according to the mode determined by a visual program, which connects standard AVS functions for creating streamlines, isosurfaces, etc.</p><p>The haptic computer is a multiprocessing DSP system based on TMS320C40 processors. Parallel C provides real-time operating system functions needed for task scheduling and consistent cycle times between sensors and actuators on the haptic interface hardware. A second copy of the data set is loaded into DSP memory, providing real-time rendering of data as the user moves the stylus through the data field. The current haptic modes are implemented with cycle times of 0.455 msec. A typical programming architecture diagram is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, where the Jacobian is the kinematic transformation matrix relating actuator rod lengths to Cartesian H Q X c R position. A number of sub-algorithms of the code can be parallelized to save computational time and maintain force rendering bandwidth. For example, if one is running the vortex core identification mode, then the orientation constraint, force to vortex core, and Jacobian calculation routines can be run simultaneously. Force controller design is discussed in greater detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>A PC hosts the DSP farm on its ISA and PCI busses, and provides a communication link between the visual and haptic computers (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>.) Since the data set is stored on both systems, very little information passes between them. Only the current stylus po-sition within the data is sent from haptic computer to the visual computer, along with selector switch (button) state. This enables the stylus glyph on the visual display to follow the user's hand motions, acting as a 5 degree of freedom mouse. When the mouse is used as a windows pointer to select menu items, this state information is also sent to the DSP computer to enable the proper rendering mode. A single 9600 baud serial line provides this link.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Cell Search and Interpolation</head><p>Fast and smooth haptic rendering is relatively easy when the data can be determined as an explicit function of position. This, however, is not the case in most applications, since the data field is usually generated by a finite element program. Thus, the data exists as values (scalar, vector, tensor) specified at each node in a threedimensional grid. In addition, this grid is likely to be irregular (element edges vary in length) and/or unstructured (elements of different topologies are present.) One must interpolate these grids extremely fast in order to maintain the sub-millisecond cycles needed for quality haptic rendering.</p><p>A brief overview of our approach is as follows; more details can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. First, we determine which data element contains the current interrogation point (tip of the stylus). Then we interpolate the position within the element, and apply these interpolation coefficients to the data values associated with element nodes. It turns out that finding the containing element is the key difficulty in irregular meshes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. This is accomplished by a directed search in a regular, non-dimensional parametric space, where the elements are successively tested for containment of the stylus position. The parametric coordinates are obtained by approximating the inverse of the element's shape function using a Newton-Raphson method. Once computed, the parametric coordinates will either indicate the containment of the test point within the given element, or direct the search to one of the 26 neighboring cells (we are using hexahedron elements at present.) Our algorithm is based on the approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, but modified for better speed and storage efficiency in realtime haptic rendering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Data Manipulation and Indexing</head><p>The ability to grab data on the screen and move it as one would manipulate a real object is important if data exploration is desired rather than data display. By giving the user complete control over view orientation, position, and scaling through natural hand motions, the focus is shifted to the data rather than the interface itself. A thick arrow glyph on the screen follows the user's hand motions at all times. When the "index" button on the stylus is pressed, the glyph becomes attached to the data being viewed, and subsequent hand motions cause both data and glyph to move with the hand. Note that arbitrary motions of the data can be accomplished by this method, despite limited range of motion of the haptic interface (and the user's wrist). By releasing the index button and moving the glyph to another part of the data or to another orientation, reindexing causes a ratcheting motion of the data, exactly analogous to "lifting the mouse". This makes it easy to find the best visual view, or to bring the data into the range of motion of the haptic interface, e.g. so that vectors in the data can be rendered as stylus orientations within a comfortable wrist/hand pose.</p><p>It is vitally important that both the visual and haptic data orientation and scale correspond during data manipulation. Feeling a data feature at one orientation and seeing it at another is almost always confusing, unless the orientations differ by only a few angular degrees. Some users are able to resolve large disparities between visual and haptic views, but this is mentally fatiguing and detracts from a mental focus on the data itself. Disparate scales are less of an issue, as long as they are not changed often. Again, this is analo-gous to the conventional mouse, where physical motion and pointer motion scale disparity is easily accommodated after a few seconds of experimenting by the user.</p><p>The data manipulation and indexing capabilities in the combined visual/haptic interface are typically learned in the first 15 minutes by novice users, and are well-retained in periodic use. This enables sophisticated visualization for the casual user, relying on natural human manipulation abilities rather than on the learning of arbitrary relationships between interface controls and their effect on the data display.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>We have developed combined visual/haptic rendering modes that enable shock waves and vortices to be more naturally explored and understood by users. The results from our initial implementation of these modes have been encouraging. In order to implement and test our shock and vortex visualization modes, we have initially chosen relatively non-complex data sets. For these non-complex data sets, the addition of the haptic modes to the traditional graphical rendering not only increases the speed with which a user understands the data, but also allows the user to more naturally manipulate and more precisely locate interesting aspects such as shock wave location and vortex core location within the data. We are continuing to test these modes on more complex and larger data sets. We are also looking into new haptic modes, such as the constraining of the stylus motion to the shock wave. Since no single shock identification method seems to always work best, it makes sense to make a variety of modes, e.g. as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, available to the user.</p><p>Further, we are in the process of exploring other data sets in fluid dynamics as well as from other fields such as earthquake ground motion simulations and medical images. As we are designing and implementing new visual/haptic rendering modes, we are working to involve domain experts in evaluating the modes, so that these modes will indeed be useful in these real applications.</p><p>As we work with different data sets and develop new rendering modes useful for particular applications, we believe that some common features will emerge in the different rendering modes. Uncovering these commonalities may allow the development of a "basis" set of modes from which more complex rendering modes can be constructed. This would allow a wide variety of modes to be made available with a relatively simple implementation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>space (zero) forces and non-zero forces and torques are accurately ren-¤ This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (IRI-9711936) and the Office of Naval Research (N00014-97-1-0354).</figDesc></figure>
