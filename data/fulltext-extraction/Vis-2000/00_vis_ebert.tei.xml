				<p>Accurately and automatically conveying the structure of a volume model is a problem not fully solved by existing volume rendering approaches. Physics-based volume rendering approaches create images which may match the appearance of translucent materials in nature, but may not embody important structural details. Transfer function approaches allow flexible design of the volume appearance, but generally require substantial hand tuning for each new data set in order to be effective. We introduce the volume illustration approach, combining the familiarity of a physicsbased illumination model with the ability to enhance important features using non-photorealistic rendering techniques. Since features to be enhanced are defined on the basis of local volume characteristics rather than volume sample value, the application of volume illustration techniques requires less manual tuning than the design of a good transfer function. Volume illustration provides a flexible unified framework for enhancing structural perception of volume models through the amplification of features and the addition of illumination effects.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>For volume models, the key advantage of direct volume rendering over surface rendering approaches is the potential to show the structure of the value distribution throughout the volume, rather than just at selected boundary surfaces of variable value (by isosurface) or coordinate value (by cutting plane).</p><p>The contribution of each volume sample to the final image is explicitly computed and included. The key challenge of direct volume rendering is to convey that value distribution clearly and accurately. In particular, showing each volume sample with full opacity and clarity is impossible if volume samples in the rear of the volume are not to be completely obscured.</p><p>Traditionally, volume rendering has employed one of two approaches. The first attempts a physically accurate simulation of a process such as the illumination and attenuation of light in a gaseous volume or the attenuation of X-rays through tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[Kajiya84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Drebin88]</ref>. This approach produces the most realistic and familiar views of a volume data set, at least for data that has an appropriate physical meaning. The second approach is only loosely based on the physical behavior of light through a volume, using instead an arbitrary transfer function specifying the appearance of a volume sample based on its value and an accumulation process that is not necessarily based on any actual accumulation mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[Levoy90]</ref>. This approach allows the designer to create a wider range of appearances for the volume in the visualization, but sacrifices the familiarity and ease of interpretation of the more physics-based approach.</p><p>We propose a new approach to volume rendering: the augmentation of a physics-based rendering process with nonphotorealistic rendering (NPR) techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[Winkenbach94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Salisbury94]</ref> to enhance the expressiveness of the visualization. NPR draws inspiration from such fields as art and technical illustration to develop automatic methods to synthesize images with an illustrated look from geometric surface models. Nonphotorealistic rendering research has effectively addressed both the illustration of surface shape and the visualization of 2D data, but has virtually ignored the rendering of volume models. We describe a set of NPR techniques specifically for the visualization of volume data, including both the adaptation of existing NPR techniques to volume rendering and the development of new techniques specifically suited for volume models. We call this approach volume illustration.</p><p>The volume illustration approach combines the benefits of the two traditional volume rendering approaches in a flexible and parameterized manner. It provides the ease of interpretation resulting from familiar physics-based illumination and accumulation processes with the flexibility of the transfer function approach. In addition, volume illustration provides flexibility beyond that of the traditional transfer function, including the capabilities of local and global distribution analysis, and light and view direction specific effects. Therefore, volume illustration techniques can be used to create visualizations of volume data that are more effective at conveying the structure within the volume than either of the traditional approaches. As the name suggests, volume illustration is intended primarily for illustration or presentation situations, such as figures in textbooks, scientific articles, and educational video.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Traditional volume rendering spans a spectrum from the accurate to the ad hoc. Kajiya's original work on volume ray tracing for generating images of clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[Kajiya84]</ref> incorporated a physicsbased illumination and atmospheric attenuation model. This work in realistic volume rendering techniques has been extended by numerous researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[Nishita87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ebert90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Krueger91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Williams92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Max95,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nishita98]</ref>. In contrast, traditional volume rendering has relied on the use of transfer functions to produce artificial views of the data to highlight regions of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Drebin88]</ref>. These transfer functions, however, require in-depth knowledge of the data and need to be adjusted for each data set.</p><p>The design of effective transfer functions is still an active research area <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Fang98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kindlmann98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fujishiro99]</ref>. While transfer functions can be effective at bringing out the structure in the value distribution of a volume, they are limited by their dependence on voxel value as the sole transfer function domain.</p><p>In contrast, there has been extensive research for illustrating surface shape using non-photorealistic rendering techniques. Adopting a technique found in painting, Gooch et al. developed a tone-based illumination model that determined hue, as well as intensity, from the orientation of a surface element to a light source <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Gooch98]</ref>. The extraction and rendering of silhouettes and other expressive lines has been addressed by several researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[Saito90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Salisbury94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gooch99,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Interrante95]</ref>. Expressive textures have been applied to surfaces to convey surface shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Rheingans96,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Salisbury97,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Interrante97]</ref>.</p><p>A few researchers have applied NPR techniques to the display of data. Laidlaw used concepts from painting to create visualizations of 2D data, using brushstroke-like elements to convey information <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Laidlaw98]</ref> and a painterly process to compose complex visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[Kirby99]</ref>.</p><p>Treavett has developed techniques for pen-and-ink illustrations of surfaces within volumes [Treavett00]. Interrante applied principles from technical illustration to convey depth relationships with halos around foreground features in flow data <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[Interrante98]</ref>. Saito converted 3D scalar fields into a sampled point representation and visualized selected points with a simple primitive, creating an NPR look <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[Saito94]</ref>. With the exceptions of the work of Saito and Interrante, the use of NPR techniques has been confined to surface rendering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Approach</head><p>We have developed a collection of volume illustration techniques that adapt and extend NPR techniques to volume objects. Most traditional volume enhancement has relied on functions of the volume sample values (e.g., opacity transfer functions), although some techniques have also used the volume gradient (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[Levoy90]</ref>). In contrast, our volume illustration techniques are fully incorporated into the volume rendering process, utilizing viewing information, lighting information, and additional volumetric properties to provide a powerful, easily extensible framework for volumetric enhancement. Comparing Diagram 1, the traditional volume rendering system, and Diagram 2, our volume illustration rendering system, demonstrates the difference in our approach to volume enhancement. By incorporating the enhancement of the volume sample's color, illumination, and opacity into the rendering system, we can implement a wide range of enhancement techniques. The properties that can be incorporated into the volume illustration procedures include the following:</p><p>• Volume sample location and value</p><p>• Local volumetric properties, such as gradient and minimal change direction</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">• View direction • Light information</formula><p>The view direction and light information allows global orientation information to be used in enhancing local volumetric features. Combining this rendering information with user selected parameters provides a powerful framework for volumetric enhancement and modification for artistic effects.</p><p>Volumetric illustration differs from surface-based NPR in several important ways. In NPR, the surfaces (features) are well defined, whereas with volumes, feature areas within the volume must be determined through analysis of local volumetric properties. The volumetric features vary continuously throughout three-dimensional space and are not as well defined as surface features. Once these volumetric feature volumes are identified, user selected parametric properties can be used to enhance and illustrate them.</p><p>We begin with a volume renderer that implements physicsbased illumination of gaseous phenomena. The opacity transfer function that we are using is the following simple power function:</p><p>where v i is the volume sample value and k os is the scalar controlling maximum opacity. Exponent k oe values less than 1 soften volume differences and values greater than 1 increase the contrast within the volume. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref> shows gaseous illumination of an abdominal CT volume of 256×256×128 voxels. In this image, as in others of this dataset, the scene is illuminated by a single light above the volume and slightly toward the viewer. The structure of tissues and organs is difficult to understand. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Figure 2</ref>, a transfer function has been used to assign voxel colors which mimic those found in actual tissue. The volume is illuminated as before. Organization of tissues into organs is clear, but the interiors of structures are still unclear. We chose to base our examples on an atmospheric illumination model, but the same approach can be easily applied to a base renderer using Phong illumination and linear accumulation.</p><p>In the following two sections, we describe our current collection of volume illustration techniques. These techniques can be applied in almost arbitrary amounts and combinations, becoming a flexible toolkit for the production of expressive images of volume models. The volume illustration techniques we </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">( ) oe k i os v v k o =</formula><p>propose are of two basic types: feature enhancement, and depth and orientation cues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Feature Enhancement</head><p>In a surface model, the essential feature is the surface itself. The surface is explicitly and discretely defined by a surface model, making "surfaceness" a boolean quality. Many other features, such as silhouettes or regions of high curvature, are simply interesting parts of the surface. Such features can be identified by analysis of regions of the surface.</p><p>In a volume model, there are no such discretely defined features. Volume characteristics and the features that they indicate exist continuously throughout the volume. However, the boundaries between regions are still one feature of interest. The local gradient magnitude at a volume sample can be used to indicate the degree to which the sample is a boundary between disparate regions. The direction of the gradient is analogous to the surface normal. Regions of high gradient are similar to surfaces, but now "surfaceness" is a continuous, volumetric quality, rather than a boolean quality. We have developed several volume illustration techniques for the enhancement of volume features based on volume gradient information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Boundary Enhancement</head><p>Levoy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[Levoy90]</ref> introduced gradient-based shading and opacity enhancement to volume rendering. In his approach, the opacity of each voxel was scaled by the voxel's gradient magnitude to emphasize the boundaries between data (e.g., tissue) of different densities and make areas of constant density transparent (e.g., organ interiors). We have adapted this idea to allow the user to selectively enhance the density of each volume sample by a function of the gradient. Assume a volume data set containing a precomputed set of sample points. The value at a location P i is a scalar given by:</p><p>We can also calculate the value gradient ∇ f (P i ) at that location. In many operations we will want that gradient to be normalized. We use ∇ fn to indicate the normalized value gradient.</p><p>Before enhancement, voxel values are optionally mapped through a standard transfer function which yields color value c v and opacity o v for the voxel. If no transfer function is used, these values can be set to constants for the whole volume. The inclusion of a transfer function allows artistic enhancements to supplement, rather than replace, existing volume rendering mechanisms.</p><p>We can define a boundary-enhanced opacity for a voxel by combining a fraction of the voxel's original opacity with an enhancement based on the local boundary strength, as indicated by the voxel gradient magnitude. The gradient-based opacity of the volume sample becomes:</p><p>where o v is original opacity and ∇ f is the value gradient of the volume at the sample under consideration. This equation allows the user to select a range of effects from no gradient enhancement (k gc =1, k gs =0) to full gradient enhancement (k gs &gt;=1) to only showing areas with large gradients (k gc =0), as in traditional volume rendering. The use of the power function with exponent k ge allows the user to adjust the slope of the opacity curve to best highlight the dataset. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref> shows the effect of boundary enhancement in the medical volume. The edges of the lungs and pulmonary vasculature can be seen much more clearly than before, as well as some of the internal structure of the kidney. Parameter values used in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref> are k gc = 0.7, k gs = 10, k ge = 2.0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Oriented Feature Enhancement: Silhouettes, Fading, and Sketch Lines</head><p>Surface orientation is an important visual cue that has been successfully conveyed by artists for centuries through numerous techniques, including silhouette lines and orientation-determined saturation effects. Silhouette lines are particularly important in the perception of surface shape, and have been utilized in surface illustration and surface visualization rendering <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[Salisbury94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Interrante95]</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, silhouette volumes increase the perception of volumetric features.</p><p>In order to strengthen the cues provided by silhouette volumes, we increase the opacity of volume samples where the gradient nears perpendicular to the view direction, indicated by a dot product between gradient and view direction which nears zero. The silhouette enhancement is described by:</p><p>where k sc controls the scaling of non-silhouette regions, k ss controls the amount of silhouette enhancement, and k se controls the sharpness of the silhouette curve. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref> shows the result of both boundary and silhouette enhancement in the medical volume. The fine honeycomb structure of the liver interior is clearly apparent, as well as additional internal structure of the kidneys. Parameter values used in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref> are k gc = 0.8, k gs = 5.0, k ge = 1.0; k sc = 0.9, k ss = 50, k se = 0.25.</p><p>Decreasing the opacity of volume features oriented toward the viewer emphasizes feature orientation, and in the extreme cases, can create sketches of the volume, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure  5</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref> shows a black and white sketch of the medical dataset by using a white sketch color and making non volumetric silhouettes transparent. To get appropriate shadowing of the sketch lines, the shadows are calculated based on the original volume opacity. Using a black silhouette color can also be effective for outlining volume data.</p><p>Orientation information can also be used effectively to change feature color. For instance, in medical illustration the portions of anatomical structures oriented toward the viewer are desaturated and structures oriented away from the view are darkened and saturated <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Clark99]</ref>. We simulate these effects by allowing the volumetric gradient orientation to the viewer to modify the color, saturation, value, and transparency of the given volume sample. The use of the HSV color space allows the system to easily utilize the intuitive color modification techniques of painters and illustrators. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 10</ref> shows oriented changes in the saturation and value of the medical volume. In this figure, the color value (V) is decreased as the angle between the gradient and the viewer increases, simulating more traditional illustration techniques of oriented fading. understanding spatial relationships of features in the volume difficult. One common approach to this difficulty is the use of hard transfer functions, those with rapidly increasing opacity at particular value ranges of interest. While this may increase depth cues by creating the appearance of surfaces within the volume, it does so by hiding all information in some regions of the volume, sacrificing a key advantage of volume rendering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Depth and Orientation Cues</head><p>Similarly, information about the orientation of features within the volume is also largely missing. Many volume rendering systems use very simple illumination models and often do not include the effect of shadows, particularly volume selfshadowing to improve performance, even though many volume shadowing algorithms have been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Ebert90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kajiya84]</ref>. Accurate volumetric shadowing often produces subtle effects which do not provide strong three-dimensional depth cues. As a result, the shape of individual structures within even illuminated volumes is difficult to perceive.</p><p>We have developed several techniques for the enhancement of depth and orientation cues in volume models, inspired by shading concepts in art and technical illustration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Distance color blending</head><p>Intensity depth-cuing is a well known technique for enhancing the perception of depth in a scene <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Foley96]</ref>. This technique dims the color of objects far from the viewer, creating an effect similar to viewing the scene through haze. We have adapted this technique for volume rendering, dimming volume sample colors as they recede from the viewer. In addition, we have augmented the standard intensity depth-cuing with a subtle color modulation. This color modulation increases the amount of blue in the colors of more distant volume samples, simulating techniques used for centuries by painters, such as aerial perspective <ref type="bibr">[daVinci1506, Beirstadt1881]</ref>. This technique exploits the tendency of cool colors (such as blue) to recede visually while warm colors (such as red) advance.</p><p>Depth-cued colors start as the voxel color at the front of the volume, decreasing in intensity and moving toward the background color as depth into the volume increases. The progression of depth-cuing need not be linear; we use an exponential function to control the application of depth-cuing. The distance color blending process can be described by:</p><p>where k ds controls the size of the color blending effect, k de controls the rate of application of color blending, d v is the fraction of distance through the volume, and c b is a defined background color. When c b is a shade of grey (c <ref type="figure">b = (a, a, a)</ref> for some value of a), only standard intensity depth-cuing is performed. Using a background color that is a shade of blue (c <ref type="figure">b = (a, b, c)</ref> for c &gt; a, b), introduces a cool shift in distant regions. Other color modulation effects are clearly possible, but make less sense perceptually. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> shows the effect of distance color blending. The ribs behind the lungs fade into the distance and the region around the kidneys seems to recede slightly. Color blending parameters used in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> are c b = (0, 0, 0.15), k ds = 1.0, k se = 0.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Feature halos</head><p>Illustrators sometimes use null halos around foreground features to reinforce the perception of depth relationships within a scene. The effect is to leave the areas just outside surfaces empty, even if an accurate depiction would show a background object in that place. Interrante <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[Interrante98]</ref> used a similar idea to show depth relationships in 3D flow data using Line Integral Convolution (LIC). She created a second LIC volume with a larger element size, using this second volume to impede the view. Special care was required to keep objects from being obscured by their own halos. The resulting halos achieved the desired effect, but the method depended on having flow data suitable for processing with LIC.</p><p>We introduce a more general method for creating halo effects during the illumination process using the local spatial properties of the volume. Halos are created primarily in planes orthogonal to the view vector by making regions just outside features darker and more opaque, obscuring background elements which would otherwise be visible. The strongest halos are created in empty regions just outside (in the plane perpendicular to the view direction) of a strong feature.</p><p>The halo effect at a voxel is computed from the distance weighted sum of haloing influences in a specified neighborhood. In order to restrict halos to less interesting regions, summed influences are weighted by the complement of the voxel's gradient. The size of the halo effect is given by:</p><p>where h n is the maximum potential halo contribution of a neighbor. The haloing influence of a neighbor is inversely related to its distance and the tendency of a location to be a halo is inversely related to its gradient magnitude.</p><p>The maximum potential halo contribution of each neighbor is proportional to the product of the alignment of the neighbor's gradient with the direction to the voxel under consideration (calculated from the dot product between them) and the degree to which the neighbor's gradient is aligned perpendicular to the view direction (also calculated as a dot product). The halo potential (h n ) is given by:</p><p>where k hpe controls how directly the neighbor's gradient must be oriented toward the current location, and k hse controls how tightly halos are kept in the plane orthogonal to the view direction. The most strong halo effects will come from neighbors that are displaced from the volume sample of interest in a direction orthogonal to the view direction and that have a large gradient in the direction of this sample.</p><p>Once the size of the halo effect has been determined, parameters control the visual appearance of halo regions. The most common adjustment to the halo region is to decrease the brightness by a scalar times the halo effect and increase the opacity by another scalar times the halo effect. This method produces effects similar to those of Interrante, but can be applied to any type of data or model during the illumination process. Since the halos generated are inherently view dependent, no special processing must be done to keep features from casting a halo on themselves. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> shows the effectiveness of adding halos to the medical volume. Structures in the foreground, such as the liver and kidneys, stand out more clearly. Halo parameters used in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> are k hpe = 1.0 and k hse = 2.0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Tone shading</head><p>Another illustrative technique used by painters is to modify the tone of an object based on the orientation of that object relative to</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">( ) b k v ds v k v ds d c d k c d k c de de + − = 1 ( ) ( ) i f neighbors n n i n i P P P h h ∇ −         − = ∑ 1 2 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) hse hpe k n fn k n i n i n fn n V P P P P P P h ⋅ ∇ −                 − − ⋅ ∇ = 1</formula><p>the light. This technique can be used to give surfaces facing the light a warm cast while surfaces not facing the light get a cool cast, giving effects suggestive of illumination by a warm light source, such as sunlight. Gooch et al. proposed an illumination model based on this technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Gooch98]</ref>, defining a parameterized model for effects from pure tone shading to pure illuminated object color. The parameters define a warm color by combining yellow and the scaled fully illuminated object color. Similarly, a cool color combines blue and the scaled ambient illuminated object color. The final surface color is formed by interpolation between the warm and cool color based on the signed dot product between the surface normal and light vector. The model assumes a single light source, generally located above the scene. We implemented an illumination model similar to Gooch tone shading for use with volume models. As with Gooch tone shading, the tone contribution is formed by interpolation between the warm and cool colors based on the signed dot product between the volume sample gradient and the light vector. Unlike Gooch tone shading, the illuminated object contribution is calculated using only the positive dot product, becoming zero at orientations orthogonal to the light vector. This more closely matches familiar diffuse illumination models.</p><p>The color at a voxel is a weighted sum of the illuminated gaseous color (including any traditional transfer function calculations) and the total tone and directed shading from all directed light sources. The new tone illumination model is given by:</p><p>where k ta controls the amount of gaseous illumination (I G ) included, N L is the number of lights, k td controls the amount of directed illumination included, I t is the tone contribution to volume sample color, and I o is the illuminated object color contribution. Although this model allows for multiple light sources, more than a few is likely to result in confusing images, since we are not used to interpreting complex illumination coming from many lights.</p><p>The tone contribution from a single light source is interpolated from the warm and cool colors, depending on the angle between the light vector and the sample gradient. It is given by:</p><p>where L is the unit vector in the direction of the light and c w = (k ty , k ty , 0), c c = (0, 0, k tb ) describe the warm and cool tone colors. Samples oriented toward the light become more like the warm color while samples oriented away from the light become more like the cool color.</p><p>The directed illumination component is related to the angle between the voxel gradient and the light direction, for angles up to 90 degrees. It is given by:</p><p>where k td controls how much directed illumination is added. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref> shows modified tone shading applied to the uncolored medical volume. The small structure of the liver shows clearly, as does the larger structures of the kidney. The bulges of intestine at the lower right are much more clearly rounded 3D shapes than with just boundary and silhouette enhancement <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 4</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref> shows tone shading applied together with colors from a transfer function. The tone effects are subtler, but still improve shape perception. The basic tissue colors are preserved, but the banded structure of the aorta is more apparent than in a simple illuminated and color-mapped image <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">(Figure 2</ref>). Tone shading parameters used in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figures 7 and 8</ref> are k ty = 0.3, k tb = 0.3, k ta = 1.0, k td = 0.6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Application Examples</head><p>We have also applied the techniques in the previous sections to several other scientific data sets. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 10 and 11</ref> are volume rendered images from a 256x256x64 MRI dataset of a tomato from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 10</ref> is a normal gas-based volume rendering of the tomato where a few of the internal structures are visible. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 11</ref> has our volume illustration gradient and silhouette enhancements applied, resulting in a much more revealing image showing the internal structures within the tomato. Parameters used in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 11</ref> are k gc = 0.5, k gs = 2.5, k ge = 3.0; k sc = 0.4, k ss = 500, k se = 0.3.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 13</ref> shows the effectiveness of boundary enhancement, silhouette enhancement, and tone shading on this data set. The overall flow structure, vortex shedding, and helical structure are much easier to perceive in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 13</ref> than in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref>.</p><p>Figures 14 and 15 are volume renderings of a 64x64x64 high-potential iron protein data set. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 14</ref> is a traditional gasbased rendering of the data. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 15</ref> has our tone shading volume illustration techniques applied, with parameters k ty = 0.15, k tb = 0.15, k ta = 1.0, k td = 0.6. The relationship of structure features and the three-dimensional location of the features is much clearer with the tone-based shading enhancements applied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>We have introduced the concept of volume illustration, combining the strengths of direct volume rendering with the expressive power of non-photorealistic rendering techniques. Volume illustration provides a powerful unified framework for producing a wide range of illustration styles using local and global properties of the volume model to control opacity accumulation and illumination. Volume illustration techniques enhance the perception of structure, shape, orientation, and depth relationships in a volume model. Comparing standard volume rendering <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figures 2, 10, 12, 14)</ref> with volume illustration images <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15</ref>) clearly shows the power of employing volumetric illustration techniques to enhance 3D depth perception and volumetric feature understanding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Future Directions</head><p>We plan on extending our collection of NPR techniques and exploring suitability of these volume illustration techniques for data exploration and diagnosis.</p></div>

We would also like to thank Dr. Elliott Fishman of Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions for the abdominal CT dataset.
