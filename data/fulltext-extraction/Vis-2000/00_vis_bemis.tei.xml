				<p>Applications of visualization techniques that facilitate comparison of simulation and field datasets of seafloor hydrothermal plumes are demonstrated in order to explore and confirm theories of plume behavior. In comparing these datasets, there is no one-to-one correspondence. We would like to show the comparison by performing quantitative capturing of large scale observable features. The comparisons are needed not only to improve the relevance of the simulations to the field observations, but also to enable real-time adjustment of shipboard data collection systems. Our approach for comparing simulation and field datasets is to use skeletonization and centerline representation. Features representing plumes are skeletonized. Skeleton points are used to construct a centerline and to quantify plume properties on planes normal to the centerline. These skeleton points are further used to construct an idealized cone representing a plume isosurface. The difference between the plume feature and the cone is identified as protrusions of turbulent eddies. Comparison of the simulation and field data sets through these abstractions illustrates how these abstractions characterize a plume.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION 1.Motivation</head><p>The visualization techniques presented in this paper are intended to facilitate comparison of simulation and field datasets of hydrothermal plumes in order to explore and validate the theories of plume behavior. Hydrothermal plumes are bodies of hot water containing mineral particles, ions, gases and microbes that discharge from vents on the sea floor. They rise buoyantly to several hundred meters above the seafloor and disperse heat, chemicals, and microbes into the ocean. Theories of plume behavior predict the shape of the plumes, their responses to ocean currents and aspects of their internal structure. Two particular aspects of plume behavior are the focus of this study. In a still, homogenous ocean plumes rise vertically. In the presence of an ocean current, plumes bend in the direction that current is flowing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The nature of this bending can be captured by describing the centerline of the plume; we present here a method of describing a plume centerline using skeletonization. The second aspect investigated here is the internal structure of the plumes. The fluid contained in a plume flows turbulently; some theories predict that there will be large coherent eddy structures within the plume. In the second visualization technique presented here, we attempt to determine the presence of these eddies and to characterize their size. This work is a continuation of our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> where an error/predictor method was used to compute a centerline. In this work, the skeleton extraction is expanded to a geometric technique with an enhancement for a shipboard environment.</p><p>Both visualization techniques are incorporated into a visualization package for shipboard analysis of new acoustic imaging data. Acoustic imaging data is acquired using sonar instrumentation attached to autonomous or tethered underwater vehicles (including submersibles). Current instrumentation is expected to acquire a complete 3-D volume image of a hydrothermal plume in less than a minute, and several hundred volume files can potentially be acquired in an hour. Because the opportunity to acquire this data is rare and expensive, it is very important that the data acquired be useful. We need to know that an hour's or day's data acquisition has been successful and the best way is a quick analysis that visualizes the data and previews the abstractions and quantifications for immediate comparison with simulations and predictions. Shipboard analysis permits onsite adjustment of acoustic imaging parameters and repositioning of acoustic instrumentation in order to maximize the quality of the collected data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Introduction to the Datasets</head><p>We applied visualization techniques to simulation and field datasets of hydrothermal plumes. The simulation dataset is from a numerical model based on a large eddy simulation in the field of computational fluid dynamics(CFD) designed to model the plumes generated by hydrothermal vents and provided by M. Wetzler and W. Lavelle of PMEL/NOAA <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The field datasets are each an acoustic image of a hydrothermal plume produced from data recorded by acoustic instrumentation mounted on a submersible while it was sitting on the seafloor facing a hydrothermal vent under 2000 to 2500 m of seawater. An acoustic image records intensity of backscatter from the particulate matter suspended in a plume. Two examples are used in this paper. The first was recorded at Monolith Vent, Cleft Segment, Juan de Fuca Ridge on September 10, 1996 at 19:06-19:33 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The second was recorded at the Clam Acres area of Southwest Vent Field, 21°N East Pacific Rise on November 20, 1990 at 20:24-20:54 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>The simulation dataset includes all parts of a hydrothermal plume and its surrounding ocean. The spatial range covered is 635 meters (along current) by 315 meters (cross current) by 310 meters (depth). In contrast, the field dataset focuses on the lowest 30 meters of the plume stem and the spatial range covered is 16 meters by 16 meters by 32 meters (vertical).</p><p>These two data sets have different scales and resolutions: the scales are 310 m in depth for the simulation dataset and 32 m in depth for the field dataset and the resolutions are 5-10 m per cell for the simulation dataset and 0.25 m per cell for the field dataset. See <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> for an example of the different scales. Therefore, the visualization process must produce measures of abstract properties that can be compared independent of scale and resolution. This study creates new programs (applying existing and new techniques) that extract overall structures and provide abstract views of the datasets in order to compare these datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">VISUALIZATION</head><p>An approach based on skeletonization and centerline extraction is used to visualize and quantify these datasets. In previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, we presented a centerline representation for plume analysis. In this paper, we expand and enhance this methodology by improving the centerline computation and demonstrating its utility for analysis.. The approach is a five-step procedure: (1) Feature extraction is performed on these datasets to separate regions of interest, which results in separate objects (in this case, the plume stem, neutrally buoyant plume and their surroundings). (2) Skeletonization is performed on each object to extract the skeletons of the object volume. This reduces each volume object to a set of points that approximately traces it's medial axis. (3) The skeleton points are averaged along a userspecified direction to generate a simplified set of points. Then a curve is produced to fit the set of points, which yields the smoothed skeleton. (4) Quantifications are then computed based on the smoothed skeleton. The most important of these is the centerline itself. (5) Eddy structures are defined and extracted from the objects to study the dynamic nature of plumes. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows a flow chart illustrating how this procedure is integrated into our shipboard analysis system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Feature Extraction</head><p>The first step of the visualization process is to define the features of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Acoustic imaging data sets record only a scalar value so features are defined using a single scalar threshold. Features are defined to be thresholded connected regions. The feature extraction module identifies all those grid points whose scalar value is equal to or larger than this threshold and stores them as separate objects. A marching cube <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> or marching tetrahedron <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> algorithm is used to extract the boundary surface of these objects. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> demonstrates the feature extraction results of the simulation and field datasets from plume study; small blue features are separated from the large red feature although they are all associated with the same isosurface.</p><p>After features are extracted, each segmented feature is associated with its vital properties. Quantifications computed include volume, integrated content, centroid, 2nd order moment, vector sum and unit of vector sum(if applicable), and local maximum set <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Abstraction as a Skeleton</head><p>In plume models, the centerline <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> is crucial in defining the quantitative and qualitative behavior of plumes. The centerline of "up-flow" is considered to be the geometric axis of a plume. This axis provides a reference for quantification of radial plume properties, e.g., distribution of intensity values from the core (which lies on the axis) to the outer surface. The centerline also provides a reference for measuring the interaction between plumes and the orientation in space of a plume, which is given by the average slope of the centerline. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, a method to extract a centerline from a plume feature was presented. The basic assumption in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> is that the plume is always rising. If the plume bends at some higher positions, this centerline module will not be able to follow the actual bending.</p><p>This paper proposes and applies a new method based on skeletonization. 3D Skeletonization involves the use of volumetric thinning to thin out a 3D volumetric region. The skeletonization process produces a minimal set of unconnected voxels which can be connected using various algorithms (such as a minimum spanning tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>). This connected set of voxels can then be simplified and smoothed using splines.</p><p>We use the skeletonization algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> which is parametric and allows us to specify a desired thickness for our skeleton. In addition, the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> is reversible and acts as a data structure to all of the voxels contained within the plume. This will allow us to register different plume datasets by registering the centerlines (which is a much easier task than registering amorphous voxel regions). Different plume datasets are very common since we are constantly acquiring new plume datasets at different times and from different underwater locations.. This is an exciting prospect which is currently under investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Computation of Centerline from Skeleton</head><p>The skeleton of a feature is computed using the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and the user can control the density of skeleton points by a parameter called the thinness parameter. The number of resulting points is still too dense (mainly due to noise at the boundary), so to reduce the skeleton point set further, a sliding "window" is used to average points within the window. The window is controlled by the scientist to concentrate points in interesting regions and to adjust the smoothness of the skeleton. The points</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure1. Flow Chart of Shipboard Analysis System</head><p>are connected using the direction of flow within the plume (upward) and/or can be splined. Examples of simplified skeletons for the plume data sets are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Quantification</head><p>Centerline properties are computed based on the skeletal line defined above. A plane perpendicular to the skeletal line is constructed at each point on the line. Quantifications on the plume are estimated including the center of area, center of mass, local maximum and its location, and area of the object cut by the plane. These values can then be compared with predictions of plume theory. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the estimated centers of mass. Although the skeletal line is a highly simplified structure, the centers of mass computed from its normal planes describe a more complicated path of the plume core. Together they capture the overall shape of the plume and the first level of its complex dynamic structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Eddy Extraction</head><p>Geologists are interested in the dynamic nature of the plumes; eddy structures inherent in the dataset are one expression of the dynamics. Eddies are used to determine how hydrothermal plumes mix and disperse heat and chemicals into the surrounding ocean. In principle, eddies are defined by some fluid dynamics properties. The definition of eddies may vary for different disciplines, but in general eddies represent coherent regions of recirculating flow within a large region experiencing turbulent fluid motion. Most past studies have extracted eddies using vector data that describes the flow field <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. However, the acoustic imaging data sets provide only scalar data. The approach of prior studies using scalar extraction of eddies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> focuses on finding values or gradients representing the eddies which is not appropriate to acoustic data of plumes.</p><p>The surface of a 3D plume object at a given intensity threshold may range from a smooth surface to a rough surface, having protrusions at various scales. For plumes, a very rough surface indicates that engulfment of ambient seawater by vortex shedding is a primary method of mixing by entrainment.</p><p>To estimate the eddies, we use an approximation of the plume feature by a regular geometric volume.</p><p>The centerline information is used to construct a 3D "cone" that can twist or bend following the centerline (this corresponds to plume theory, see below). The radius of the cone varies as the plume expands along its centerline. Voxels within a radius of the centerline along a plane of oriented perpendicular to the centerline are considered to be part of the cone. The cone can be "extracted" from the original object using volumetric differencing. The remaining part of the volume will be termed the "eddy", but is actually only that part of the eddy that extends beyond the idealized steady state plume boundaries. For any threshold value, the "idealized" and actual isosurface can be compared to find the eddies using the subtraction method.</p><p>The equation used to determine the radius, which is the ideal plume extents at a particular threshold percentage, for each slice is <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( )       + = 3 / 5 0 ln z G z b r α ,</formula><p>where r is the radius, z is the height of the skeleton point, b 0 is the initial radius at the lowest skeleton point, α the entrainment coefficient, and G is a quantity relating the threshold value to the initial plume properties (such as initial concentration, buoyancy flux, and initial volume flux) which can be thought of as the threshold percentage. In this implementation, b 0 , α and G are supplied and adjusted by the user during the computation. Once the radius at each skeleton point is computed, all nodes along a normal plane to the centerline at the skeleton point are tested to determine whether they are within the radius. Nodes within a radius of the centerline along a normal plane are considered to be part of the cone. After nodes are tested for all skeleton points, those nodes not assigned to the cone are assigned to the "eddy". The eddies and the cones can be visualized with alpha shapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> to produce boundary surface representations of scattered points remaining from the differencing. This is similar to visualizing interval volumes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the surface representations for the eddy and cone for an acoustic imaging dataset and the simulation dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">COMPARISON OF THE SIMULATION AND FIELD DATASETS</head><p>In comparing the simulation and field datasets, there is no one-to-one correspondence because the scales and resolutions are different. We have attempted to show a "gross correlation" in the datasets by comparing abstractions of the datasets.</p><p>The first comparison of the simulation and observation datasets focused on the plume stream behavior. The bending of the plume stream by the ambient ocean current is observed in both <ref type="figure">(Figure 3)</ref>. Features in the simulation dataset begin to bend and then flow in horizontal direction only after reaching neutral buoyant layer, although the plume stream rises at a 19° angle from the vertical. Features in acoustic imaging datasets begin to bend slightly (18°) to extremely (41°) within the field of view, which is far below the neutral buoyant layer. The earlier bending may be an illusion of scale and resolution or an indication that the current was stronger relative to the source buoyancy flux in the field compared to the model; future acoustic imaging data sets will be more spatially extensive which may clarify the source of differences. In both, the plume stream is bent from the vertical expected in the presence of a current, showing that the simulation does reproduce some features of the observed plume. But the smaller resolution (0.25 meter) of the field dataset shows the detailed behavior of how this slight shift from vertical rise happens, whereas the larger resolution (5-10 meters) of the simulation dataset captures only the fact that the rise is not perfectly vertical. The shape bending to horizontal in the simulation dataset is the effect of the current pushing the neutrally buoyant portion of the plume (which has ceased to rise) downstream.</p><p>The second comparison of the simulation and acoustic imaging datasets focused on the eddy dynamics of entrainment. An idealized steady state model of each plume was constructed so as to follow the centerline. The remaining portion outside that cone (which we have termed eddy above) represents the protrusions of turbulent eddies outside the steady state boundaries. For both the simulation and the acoustic imaging data, the eddy protrusions extend vertically along the plume stem and are rotated slightly around the cone in the downstream direction ( <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). Different thresholds were chosen to best visualize the shape of the eddy protrusions. Comparison with contoured slices <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 4</ref>) confirms the downstream extension of the eddy protrusions. The velocity information available from the simulation dataset is consistent with eddies shaped as longitudinal rolls running parallel to the plume core and shifted towards the downstream side <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. We are currently investigating what percentage of eddies are captured by this technique using the velocity simulation data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">SHIPBOARD ANALYSIS SYSTEMS</head><p>An overview of the shipboard analysis system is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. All of the algorithms described in this paper have been implemented as a set of AVS modules running on a PC. This PC will form one component of an interactive process of data collection in an upcoming cruise (summer 2000). On shipboard, acoustic data will be collected by sonar instrumentation attached to an underwater vehicle and relayed to a computer dedicated to visualization. A new data set may be received as often as once per minute. Data sets will be visualized as isosurfaces, centerlines and eddy protrusions. Interpretations of the results will be used to assess the sonar performance and reposition the underwater vehicle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>A comparison of simulation and field (acoustic imaging) datasets illustrated the utility of the shipboard analysis system for highlighting the abstract properties of plumes and for focusing attention on the similarities and differences between hydrothermal plumes in nature and simulations of hydrothermal plumes. The simulation data set has coarser resolution and a larger scale which provides a overview of the plume response to current. The smaller scale and higher resolution acoustic data show similar bending properties in the plume stem with a more detailed picture of how that bending is accomplished. Eddy extraction yields similar eddy protrusion structures for both suggesting the projected similarity in eddy dynamics holds. The methodology and modules developed will be utilized in an upcoming scientific cruise. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The skeleton (black line), which is the geometric center, and centers of mass (green spheres) are compared for the simulation and acoustic imaging data sets. The small box in the simulation image shows the extent of the acoustic imaging data set. Note the similar slopes of the skeletons in both images. The isosurface threshold is 5% of the maximum value for both data sets. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. The ideal steady-state plume isosurface (yellow object) and eddy protrusions (red object) are compared for the simulation and acoustic imaging data sets. The small box in the simulation image shows the extent of the acoustic imaging data set. Note that the eddy protrusions extend vertically along the plume in both data sets and appear slightly shifted in the down current direction.</p><p>The isosurface thresholds are 10% for the simulation data set and 25% for the acoustic imaging data set. Different thresholds were chosen to best visualize the shape of the eddy protrusions. Tick marks are every 10 m for the simulation and every 4 m (16 nodes) for the acoustic imaging dataset. Color contoured slices are compared for the simulation and acoustic imaging data sets at 15 m above the seafloor. The small box in the simulation image shows the extent of the acoustic imaging data set. The normalized colormap is the same for both images. The contour lines (pink) are evenly spaced between the minimum and maximum. Note the down current extension of the contours in both cases.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 4 .</head><label>4</label><figDesc>Figure 4.
