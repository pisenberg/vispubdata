<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Internet routing is largely dependent on Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). However, BGP does not have any inherent authentication or integrity mechanisms that help make it secure. Effective security is challenging or infeasible to implement due to high costs, policy employment in these distributed systems, and unique routing behavior. Visualization tools provide an attractive alternative in lieu of traditional security approaches. Several BGP security visualization tools have been developed as a stop-gap in the face of ever-present BGP attacks. Even though the target users, tasks, and domain remain largely consistent across such tools, many diverse visualization designs have been proposed. The purpose of this study is to provide an initial formalization of methods and visualization techniques for BGP cybersecurity analysis. Using PRISMA guidelines, we provide a systematic review and survey of 29 BGP visualization tools with their tasks, implementation techniques, and attacks and anomalies that they were intended for. We focused on BGP visualization tools as the main inclusion criteria to best capture the visualization techniques used in this domain while excluding solely algorithmic solutions and other detection tools that do not involve user interaction or interpretation. We take the unique approach of connecting (1) the actual BGP attacks and anomalies used to validate existing tools with (2) the techniques employed to detect them. In this way, we contribute an analysis of which techniques can be used for each attack type. Furthermore, we can see the evolution of visualization solutions in this domain as new attack types are discovered. This systematic review provides the groundwork for future designers and researchers building visualization tools for providing BGP cybersecurity, including an understanding of the state-of-the-art in this space and an analysis of what techniques are appropriate for each attack type. Our novel security visualization survey methodology-connecting visualization techniques with appropriate attack types-may also assist future researchers conducting systematic reviews of security visualizations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) was not built with security in mind. And yet, as the most widely used inter-domain routing protocol on the internet, it is a constant target for myriad threat actors. There has been a proliferation of attacks and anomalies on the BGP system <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[1]</ref>, and the number of BGP attacks and anomalies increases each year <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[46]</ref>. With society's growing reliance on internet and networked systems for vital goods and services including online medications, healthcare information, banking transactions, major utilities and more, coupled with the ability of BGP anomalies to affect large swaths of internet resources and millions of users, the need to quickly respond to BGP anomalies is paramount. Even though BGP is governed by a simple set of protocol rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[59]</ref>, in operational practice BGP routing policy is complex and decentralized-often making any local security adoption challenging to assess for effectiveness. Other challenges exist that add to the inability to implement traditional security approaches. For example, the system produces voluminous data in the form of reachability and update messages where just a few routing updates can generate thousands of BGP messages. Additionally, incidents drastically vary in duration from minutes to several hours making the prospects of properly capturing data from an attack challenging. While there are possible automated solutions for adding security to the BGP system-such as Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) and Secure BGP (S-BGP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">51]</ref>-the deep entrenchment and foundational role of BGP in the internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[64]</ref> means that the protocol does not often change and infrastructure and software upgrades are costly. Because of these challenges, visualization tools present a feasible alternative to manage and understand operations, security incidents, and anomalies.</p><p>expert users in identifying, analyzing and understanding BGP attacks and anomalies. For example, well-known and publicly available tools such as BGPlay<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[14]</ref>, and more recently Upstream Visibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[9]</ref> and ProBGP <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[77]</ref>, have been designed for use by network operators, researchers, and law enforcement. However, there has been less BGP visualization tool development than one might expect given how fundamental BGP is to the internet, as well as its historically-unresolved security issues. A cursory survey of existing tools shows that-although the domain characterization, tasks, and approaches are largely similarthe visualization techniques employed are quite diverse. This diversity of options can cause confusion about which tool to use in which scenario, and, ultimately, lower adoption rates of security approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[62]</ref>.</p><p>As Butler et al. argue, "no solution has yet struck an adequate balance between comprehensive security and deployment cost" <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[7]</ref>. Another reason for lower adoption rates may be because many of the existing BGP visualization tools have not been validated using human-subjects studies and, instead, are "failing to address the focal points of user experience" <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[65]</ref>. Yet, with several recent and high profile BGP incidents <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">46]</ref>, a growing reliance on internet services, and issues that prevent traditional security approaches, creating effective visualizations in this space remains an open challenge. The purpose of this paper is to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(1)</ref> serve as a call to action for more visualization work to support BGP security as well as <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(2)</ref> provide an in-depth survey and analysis of existing BGP security visualizations to guide future researchers and practitioners.</p><p>In this paper, we use PRISMA guidelines <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> to offer a systematic review of BGP visualization tools. Our review details the state-of-theart in BGP security visualization and provides the background necessary for designers to build effective and useful visualization tools for current and future threats. We approach this review from three perspectives. The first is to explore how BGP visualization tools have evolved over time. For each tool, we draw connections with the attacks or anomalies that were used to demonstrate and validate the tool's functionality. We draw conclusions about whether and how BGP visualization tools evolve in response to a changing threat model. Second, we categorize the BGP visualization tools by the visualization techniques they employ and the human tasks they are designed to support. Our third approach is to categorize the attacks themselves by type. We offer a novel mapping of visualization techniques to attack types, so that we may identify missing capabilities and opportunities for combining capabilities from existing approaches to better address novel BGP attacks. This study serves not only as a mechanism for understanding the BGP visualization tool space from a historic and evolutionary perspective-including exposing potential capability gaps and future threats-but as a broader survey methodology that can be applied for other security-related tools as well. This study contributes:</p><p>1. A comprehensive and systematic survey of the state-of-the-art in BGP visualization, which will assist researchers and practitioners designing the next generation of tools for BGP security. This survey provides:</p><p>(a) A timeline view of BGP visualization tool developments and historic BGP attacks. Understanding the evolution of this domain and the changing threat model can highlight whether and how tools have changed in response.</p><p>(b) A categorization of BGP visualization tools by the component visualization techniques they employ.</p><p>(c) A categorization of BGP attacks and anomalies by type.</p><p>(d) A mapping of the visualization techniques used to the BGP attacks they were meant to address. By analyzing these connections, we can identify which techniques may be most appropriate for known or novel attacks, where there are gaps in current approaches, and where approaches can be combined to help guide future research and development.</p><p>2. A novel survey methodology for security related visualization tools, exemplified by our case here with BGP visualization, that directly maps visualization techniques to attack types in order to provide a richer context for future development and a formalization of visualization techniques for this domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED SURVEYS AND MOTIVATION</head><p>We identified three types of surveys and studies that describe this domain and the state-of-the-art. These are: surveys that focus on overall BGP security, surveys that look at BGP anomaly detection tools, and surveys that more specifically look at BGP visualization tools and techniques. Our study is distinct in that we additionally (1) identify the BGP attack types existing tools were designed to address and (2) how visualization techniques employed in these tools map to those attack types. We provide examples of each of these survey types in order of their specificity and how they relate to our own study. Some of the examples in each survey did not meet our inclusion criteria defined in Section 4. We cite and discuss these examples more thoroughly in Section 4.1. Prior studies motivating the three survey types are summarized below: Surveys of overall BGP security issues: Butler et al. provided an overview survey of current BGP security issues and proposed security solutions such as cryptographic, session security, and filtering techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[7]</ref>. However, they argue that most proposed security solutions are infeasible to deploy because none of them strike a balance between overall security and cost. Gilad et al. go further to explain the challenges in depth, as well as realistic goals for implementing security mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[26]</ref>. Our survey takes a different approach by instead focusing on current security methods and visualization tools that enable operators to make security decisions-recognizing that the current visualization tool landscape in this domain can benefit from a formalization of techniques.</p><p>Surveys of BGP anomaly detection tools: Al-Musawi et al. surveyed 20 BGP anomaly detection tools, categorizing them by approach, BGP features used to identify the anomaly, and effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[1]</ref>. Additionally, they proposed a taxonomy of BGP anomalies separated by whether the anomalies were direct or indirect, intended or unintended, or a result of link failure. Al-Musawi et al. connected these anomaly features with these overall classifications. However, the tools they surveyed are not visualization-centric. Instead, they focus more on algorithmic techniques and pattern matching. In our survey, we recognize that solely algorithmic solutions are not enough to provide operators with actionable intelligence and that visualization can aid in both anomaly detection and decision making.</p><p>Surveys of BGP visualization tools and techniques: Shiravi et al. provided a use-case-centered survey on visualization systems for network security, with a subset of the study focusing on BGP and routing behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[65]</ref>. They cited six BGP tools, five of which are included in our systematic review: <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">80]</ref>. However, the visualization technique classification only provided high-level labels including node link graphs, histograms, and color maps, and consideration of lower level visualization features is needed to differentiate.</p><p>Tamassia et al. offered another survey of visualization techniques focusing on the application of graph drawing methods to cybersecurity areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[69]</ref>. Again, BGP-relevant work was a subset of the overall survey and only two examples were provided with high-level labels (force-directed and circular graph drawing methods). These examples are included in our review: <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">73]</ref>.</p><p>Ulmer et al. provided a more comprehensive and specific survey of BGP visualization tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[75]</ref>. They examined 12 tools, nine of which are included in our study: <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">64]</ref>. Additionally, they provide an overall domain characterization including challenges, data sources and users. Ulmer et al. graded the 12 examples based on their accessibility, scalability, ability to discover BGP incidents and other attributes-we, on the other hand, focus on the visualization techniques themselves. Going further back to 2012, Biersack et al. presented a survey of nine BGP visual analytics tools, seven of which appear in our survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">80]</ref>, that not only considers the visualization techniques employed, but also lower-level visualization features, interaction methods, and use cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[5]</ref>. Additionally, they distinguish between BGP visualizations that are high-level, or overview, lower-level, or local view, and multi-view. However, only nine tools were presented (compared to the 29 we reviewed) and several novel methods have been proposed since.</p><p>Finally, Youn et al. presented a study on BGP visualization tools focused on cyber situational awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[82]</ref>. Their survey canvassed 10 tools, seven of which appear in our study: <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">76]</ref>, and give more specifics on the visualization techniques employed, core functions, level of detail and use cases. However, they do not consider the specific attacks used to validate the tools or attempt to map the visualization techniques to the attack types.</p><p>Our study complements these previous surveys by providing a deeper examination of the connection between visualization techniques and attack types, as well as a formalization of the visualization techniques in this domain. We consider all aspects of BGP visualization tools, including their tasks, techniques, and, more particularly, the attacks that they were designed to detect and analyze. We produce insights into how the visualization tools in this domain are evolving with the attacks, and show the application of specific combinations of visual techniques used for specific attack types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">BGP BACKGROUND AND TERMINOLOGY</head><p>In this section, we introduce BGP concepts and terminology in order to help familiarize visualization researchers with this domain. We start with a few computer networking basics.</p><p>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique designation that defines an end system or router on the internet or a local network <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[39]</ref>. Currently, Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), first deployed in 1983, is still used to route the majority of internet traffic today even though its successor, Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), was developed in 1998 to increase the possible address space <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[29]</ref>. IPv4 is a 32-bit address divided into four 8-bit octets, while IPv6 uses a 128-bit address divided into sixteen 8-bit octets. An aggregation of these addresses is denoted by a network prefix, which shows the number of left-most bits that are the same in the group of addresses. For example, 155.33.0.0/16 represents the IP addresses 155.33.0.0-155.33.255.255. A collection of these IP prefixes under the control of one entity is called an Autonomous System (AS), which is denoted by a unique AS Number (ASN). For example, one of Northeastern University's networks is AS156 with the IP prefix 155.33.0.0/16, which is composed of 65,536 IP addresses <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> .</p><p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> is responsible for the global coordination system of IP addresses and ASNs. IP address space is generally allocated in a hierarchical manner beginning with a Regional Internet Registry (RIR), then subdivided to an Internet Service Provider (ISP), then to organizations and users <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[31]</ref>. According to Huston's BGP 2020 report, there were 860,000 prefixes (up by 6% from the previous year) and 66,800 ASes (up by 5%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[34]</ref>.</p><p>Routers internal to an AS use internal BGP to communicate routing and reachability information with other routers within the AS. External BGP is used by border routers, or, routers that sit along the edge of an AS, to communicate routing and reachability information between ASes. This information comes in the form of four types of BGP messages: Open, Update, Notification, and Keep Alive. The Update and Notification messages-which advertise new routes, update existing routes, or withdraw routes-are the prime targets for BGP attacks and more often the cause of misconfigurations <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[45]</ref>. When discussing security mechanisms and where they are applied, the BGP messages and the data contained in them represent the data plane. The way the messages are routed, and the decisions, policies, and rules used in routing is the control plane. Since there are no authentication or integrity mechanisms for these messages, they are relatively easy to forge, which can lead to "blackholing", loss of data, issues with resource reachability, and confidentiality <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[27]</ref>. An attacker can intercept data by routing it through an AS of choice or simply drop the data altogether, essentially making online resources unreachable. However, one of the visualization challenges in identifying BGP attacks and anomalies is that both intentional and unintentional incidents can propagate in the same way. Discerning the difference between an attack versus an innocent misconfiguration is difficult not only from a visualization perspective, but from a fundamental security perspective as well.</p><p>Additionally, it is important to note that each AS has its own routing policy defined by the AS owner or operator. Accounting for decentrallyexecuted routing policies, which affect how attacks propagate, coupled with the inherent challenges in representing dynamic networks is another major challenge to the visualization design space. Routing policies favor and prioritize certain routes over others depending on several weighted factors including, for example, shortest or most reliable paths, cost, local preference, geopolitical considerations, and peering relationships, and each AS may either propagate or drop the message depending on its own internal policy. Routers can receive multiple update messages for the same IP prefix and choose which route to use. It is not always apparent what the impact of a false routing message will be or how it will propagate through the network of ASes, which makes modeling or visualizing future BGP behavior challenging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY</head><p>The scope of this paper focuses on BGP security-not in the form of prevention, but rather on incident and anomaly identification and analysis. Even this subset of the domain encompasses a wide variety of techniques, algorithms, and methods for detecting BGP issues. We limit our systematic review to focus on BGP tools that use visualization techniques in order to aid users in identifying, analyzing, and characterizing BGP attacks and anomalies. In this section, we discuss eligibility and inclusion criteria, how we conducted our search, and how we processed and collected the data.</p><p>With relatively few papers encompassed in this review <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(29)</ref>, one obvious question from the perspective of justifying this type of study is: Why focus on BGP visualization tools in the first place? One key reason for this choice is that this domain from the perspective of management and security is ripe for visualization solutions and techniques. A formalization of these techniques is needed for designers and researchers, not only to survey what has been implemented in the past, but, more importantly, to understand which visualization techniques are commonly used for different types of attacks and anomalies. Additionally, one benefit of having fewer included papers is that we can compare several different attributes in order to define, formalize, and map visualization techniques to real BGP attacks-as well as identify areas that require more research and focus. We believe that our literature search has surfaced a sufficiently-representative sample of BGP visualization tools to accomplish these goals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data Collection Process</head><p>In collecting publications to include in this review, we recognized that our domain was a cross section of both visualization and cybersecurity and, thus, papers came from both communities of research. We applied a top-down approach starting by identifying well-known tools using high-level searches in IEEE Xplore, the ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar. We further refined our search to focus more on current visualization and security conferences, venues, and journals, including IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG), IEEE Visualization (VIS), the Eurographics Conference on Visualization (EuroVis), and the IEEE Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security (VizSec). From each relevant paper, we followed their citations to identify additional publications to include as well as the later incoming citations, which we discovered using Google Scholar. We used keywords to generate the search results including, for example, "BGP", "BGP visualization", "BGP tool", and "BGP visualization techniques". Additionally, we received feedback, guidance, and recommendations from members of the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis's (CAIDA) BGP Visualization Working Group.</p><p>In total, 1,336 records were identified. Of these records, only 58 were identified as security or attack detection related tools that use visualization in some way. Of the 58 records, we identified 29 publications between 2002 and 2021 that use visualization techniques specifically to allow users to identify, understand, analyze, or characterize BGP attacks and anomalies and eliminated purely algorithmic solutions. In this process, we also identified eight surveys, four additional papers that provide background knowledge and domain characterization, six live projects accessible online, and 13 papers that were deemed out of scope. A full list of venues, surveys, and papers can be found in our resources posted at https://osf.io/tupz6/.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">node-link 20 ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩</formula><p>In terms of the papers that were excluded from this survey, we wanted to ensure that we captured the breadth of BGP tools that used visualization techniques while making sure that the papers met our criteria. Several published papers present extraordinary and useful work in the domain of BGP security, but do not use visualization techniques as a mechanism to communicate results or inform decisions. There are lower-level papers focused solely on BGP anomaly detection such as a prefix hijack alert and notification systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[40]</ref>, the use of deep learning or data mining algorithms for anomaly detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">47]</ref>, comparing detection methods using decision trees versus naive Bayes methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[16]</ref>, and detecting anomalies in dynamic networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[52]</ref>. We identified papers that were data-centric and more focused on data generation and processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[25]</ref>, refining and simplifying BGP data <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[81]</ref>, or BGP data extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[6]</ref>. Other papers were visualization-specific, but focused on different aspects such as exploration processes when using BGP visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[72]</ref>, visual metaphors <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[32]</ref>, and evaluation of specific visualization techniques such as using link weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[42]</ref>. Finally, we also explored higher-level papers that were not necessarily domainspecific, such as one that visualized collective anomalies <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[70]</ref> and a system to validate routing policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[44]</ref>.</p><p>There are multiple examples of papers that offer analysis and solutions toward a better and more secure BGP environment. However, we scoped our study to focus solely on visualization tools. Restricting our scope enabled us to provide an analysis of what visualization techniques are used and to connect those techniques to attack types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Data Analysis Process</head><p>The authors of this study categorized each collected paper using tagging in an iterative process across three sets of attributes (visualization techniques, attack types, visualization tasks). We also consulted with CAIDA's BGP Visualization Working Group. What follows is a description of how we analyzed the BGP tools across these attributes:</p><p>1. For visualization technique attributes, we used multiple tags to categorize the papers based on the high-level visualization techniques employed in the tools, lower-level visualization features, and level of user interaction. We mainly relied on the figures of the tools in the papers to determine which visualization techniques were used. We did use live examples when possible. We discuss the top visualization techniques used in Section 6.1.</p><p>2. For attack types, we pulled out all BGP attacks and anomalies from the papers that were used to evaluate the performance of the tool or illustrate its use, and used tags to indicate the overall attack type and which papers used which attacks noting when different papers used the same attacks. When the papers were not specific about the details that would allow us to cross-reference the BGP attack or anomaly through a literature search, we noted the overall attack type for which the tool was intended to be used. There were a few papers where neither the attack, anomaly specifics, or attack type were apparent. In those cases, we marked the attack type as unknown or unavailable. We discuss the specific attack types further in Sections 5.1 and 6.2.</p><p>3. For visualization tasks, we collected and categorized all of the visualization tasks in the papers by similarity in goals and then categorized them further by overall action and sub-action using Munzner's taxonomy of task abstraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[49]</ref>. Visualization tasks are discussed further in Section 5.2.2.</p><p>All visualization technique, attack type, and task categorization decisions are available in our supplemental materials at https://osf. io/tupz6/. What follows are descriptions and discussions of the first three visualization products that resulted from this data analysis process, including how they can be used in combination and particular insights:</p><p>• Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> is a parallel timeline that temporally depicts the BGP attacks and anomalies from the papers in this survey encoded with discrete colors by attack type, and the BGP visualization tools used to detect them encoded with a continuous color scale to depict the number of attacks used in that particular paper. The connecting edges between the tools and attacks are encoded with the same discrete color of the attack, which allows the reader to better follow the connections. Several insights can be made from this figure. For example:</p><p>-The focus of attack types seems to evolve over time. Earlier tools developed between 2002 and 2009 used BGP attack types that were largely unknown. Tools then focused on prefix hijack attacks almost exclusively until 2016. Then, more recent studies seem to focus on route leaks and outages.</p><p>-The number of BGP attacks used to validate the tools seems to increase over time from very few attacks (one to ten) early on to many (twenty plus) in more recent studies.</p><p>-It is interesting to note that some of the same attacks were used by multiple tools</p><p>• Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the top level visualization techniques implemented in the BGP tools, lower level visualization features, such as edge thickness in node-link visualizations, and some combinations of techniques implemented, such as maps combined with node-link graphs. We also provide dot sequences depicting frequency from an overview visual perspective as well as the discrete number of tools out of the 29 studies that use that particular technique. For example, 20 of the 29 tools use node-link graphs, which is the most used technique in this domain, and three of those 20 use edge thickness to encode more particular information.</p><p>• Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref> shows the distribution of visualization tasks categorized by action and sub-action using Munzner's taxonomy of task abstraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[49]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">LITERATURE REVIEW: DOMAIN CHARACTERIZATION</head><p>In this section, we present background, domain characterization and attack descriptions of BGP through the lens of visualization design and literature to provide context, background and challenges in this domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">BGP Attack and Anomaly Types</head><p>Publicly known and documented BGP attacks and anomalies are commonly used to evaluate BGP visualization tools. Sixteen out of 29 of the papers in this survey evaluated their tools in this way while only six of the papers conducted user studies. The prevalence of this approach illustrates that evaluation of visual analytics is challenging <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[78]</ref>. Using known attacks to evaluate BGP tools has benefits from the perspective of understanding an attack and how it is visualized, but also drawbacks with respect to the true ability to effectively identify unknown attacks. As Fischer et al. note, "On the one hand, real-world scenarios often have no ground truth, and on the other hand, only experts can identify and validate insights" <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[23]</ref>. Understanding and characterizing the BGP attack surface such as the different dimensions and types of attacks that can occur as well as the vulnerabilities, is critical to visualization designers not only from a design perspective, but also for evaluation purposes. However, there is an apparent issue with balancing the use of already known attacks to evaluate BGP tools and obtaining ground truth about which identified anomalies are actually incidents.</p><p>BGP remains a perilously vulnerable domain. Described in The National Security Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, BGP vulnerabilities are the "[...] greatest risk of being the target of attacks designed to disrupt or degrade service on a large scale" <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[30]</ref> and several thousand BGP incidents occur each year <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[60]</ref>. As we investigated and classified BGP attacks and anomalies through documented attributes, we categorized and mapped them to visualization techniques. The BGP incidents used to validate BGP visualization tools largely fell into four categories: prefix hijack, route leak, misconfiguration, and physical or logical outages. What follows is an overview of each BGP attack or anomaly. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows which tools were designed for which attacks.</p><p>Prefix Hijack occurs when an AS incorrectly claims to originate a prefix it was not delegated or owns, causing a multiple origin AS (MOAS) incident where a router has multiple potential paths to reach a resource. By creating an update or announcement message that provides a more attractive route, which agrees more with an AS routing policy than previous updates, attackers can monitor or spy on network traffic, censor access to internet resources, potentially inject malicious software, or even drop network data altogether <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[75]</ref>. Several studies categorize different types of prefix hijacks in different ways. For example, Mitseva et al. shows different prefix hijack outcomes through an interception or replay attack, and different means, such as sub prefix hijacks and AS path forgeries <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[48]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Sermpezis et al.</ref> propose two different classifications based on the announced AS path and data plane traffic manipulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[63]</ref>. Candela et al. differentiate between same prefix, or origin AS, and more specific prefixes favored by AS routing policies. Because every paper had different levels of detail, we could only classify incidents with the overall prefix hijack label. Eleven out of the 29 papers in this survey specifically mention prefix hijack as an attack type its tool was designed to support.</p><p>Route Leak occurs when an AS learns of a new route and propagates the routing announcement beyond its intended scope, violating the policies of the receiver, sender, or one of the ASes along the announced AS path <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[66]</ref>. This type of attack can send data through an alternate path, which enables possible eavesdropping or data manipulation, but most often occurs by accident or misconfiguration. Nine of the 29 papers mention route leaks as an attack type its tool was designed to support with six of the 9 also supporting prefix hijacks.</p><p>Misconfiguration occurs relatively frequently and can have spectacular and public consequences (most recently, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[3]</ref>). They are defined as an intended or unintended production or suppression of BGP announcement messages and are reported as the source of close to three in four of all new prefix announcements <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[45]</ref>. Occurring at the router level, they can cause adverse reachability impacts from increased routing loads, disruptions in connectivity, and policy violations. Even though BGP misconfigurations are listed in the literature as the most common, only three of the 29 papers contain this attack type.</p><p>Physical or Logical Outages are a common occurrence in network routing and can take several forms, including downed routers and cable cuts. Whether they manifest in a physical way, such as a backhoe or ship cutting a cable, or in a logical or digital manner through bombarding a network resource via a denial of service (DoS) attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[37]</ref> or a worm <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[21]</ref>, Bellovin and Gansner show that these types of outages can be used to force internet traffic through an attacker's AS of choice to either capture or black hole the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[4]</ref>. Additionally, an outage of a commonly used router or network resource can create several thousand BGP update messages as data reroutes around the obstacle. Fifteen of the 29 papers in this survey, which is the most of any other category, mention physical or logical outages as an attack type the tools support.</p><p>Unfortunately, nine of the 29 papers in this survey did not mention an attack type specifically, or the attack types were unknown or unavailable. Some papers had lower levels of detail and sub categories of attacks, such as prefix matching or more specific prefix attacks such as in Candela et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[9]</ref>. Additionally, these higher-level attacks can sometimes overlap in terms of observable routing behavior. One of the main challenges with respect to BGP attack and anomaly types is the ability to discern normal from malicious routing behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[67]</ref>. In fact, all of the incidents can be accidental as well as malicious <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[19]</ref>. Additionally, based on the attack definitions, it is relatively easy for researchers to incorrectly classify or mislabel incidents in this domain, and one root attack may cause several instances of different types of BGP incidents as it propagates through a larger network. These often confused definitions are another motivation for our study, which formalizes the visualization techniques to identify specific attack types. Better information on BGP attacks and anomalies used to validate or demonstrate tool capabilities is necessary in this domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Users, Tasks and Data</head><p>The characterization of the BGP security domain is largely consistent across the papers in this survey, even though the visualization techniques are diverse. In this section, we provide descriptions for the intended users, tasks, data, and current challenges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">Users</head><p>In general, BGP visualization tools are intended for expert users or users with strong domain knowledge. Ulmer et al., for example, define the primary target users of their tool as administrators and prefix owners, with regulators, ISPs, and Internet exchange point (IXP) Managers as secondary users <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[77]</ref>. Additionally, Di Donato et al. focuses on network operators <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[22]</ref>. However, there is also a need for visualization tools geared toward practitioners who communicate with the general public, such as policy makers and journalists. These types of users need to communicate the effects of not only large impact incidents and outages that affect larger populations, such as the most recent Facebook outage that reportedly affected 6 billion users <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[2]</ref>, but also more targeted effects on smaller providers and companies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">Tasks</head><p>From an overview perspective, BGP visualization tools are intended to help network operators, researchers and law enforcement to identify and analyze BGP anomalies, routing patterns, and behaviors in order to investigate and understand what actions are necessary to restore network services. However, not all tools in this survey have clearly defined tasks, and we derived some tasks based on the tool description and paper goals. The lack of clearly defined visualization tasks is a key problem for visualization designers in this domain. A more detailed level of fidelity in visualization tasks will better aid researchers in this domain. Still, there is a high degree of commonality between the tasks and requirements for each tool in this survey. Even though it was not always possible to derive tasks for every tool, the collected tasks and categorization is a good representation of the task needs of this domain because of the clear commonalities that exist between tools.</p><p>For this survey, we recorded both explicitly defined visualization tasks and derived other tasks from tool requirements. We arrived at 72 unique tasks and grouped the tasks based on common goals, such as the ability to drill down, detect changes, diagnose issues, and explore. Next, we categorized the tasks based on their actions and sub-actions using Munzner's task abstraction taxonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[49]</ref>. A full list of these tasks and categorizations are available at https://osf.io/tupz6/ and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref> is a summary of this work.</p><p>Several insights can be inferred from this chart including that most of the tasks fall within the Analysis and Query actions with Consume and Identify as the top sub-actions. The higher amounts of tasks that fall into the Consume, Produce and Identify sub-actions suggests that users have a stake in the BGP anomaly identification and analysis process. This aligns with Fischer et al. 's argument that algorithms are not enough in this domain to provide actionable insights about the threat landscape <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[23]</ref>. Additionally, over 20% of the tasks had to do with the overall goal of incident and anomaly detection. This, coupled with the low number of tasks categorized with the Search action, suggests that users desire to be alerted about BGP anomalies as opposed to having to search for those occurrences. In general, users want to be part of the analysis and diagnosis process, but expect a degree of automated detection and actionable intelligence in order to know how to fix any issues. As Papadopoulos et al. argue about solely algorithmic approaches, such as data mining and signature based methods, the analyst is left out of the detection procedure and as a result cannot change parameters and dynamically redefine the results <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[56]</ref>. Further, because of the difficulty of discerning suspicious versus normal routing behavior, a user in the loop is needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.3">Data</head><p>In papers reviewed and included in this survey, data sources are few, and they overlap in several canonical BGP incidents used to evaluate multiple visualization tools. Although most papers agree and seem to favor a user in the loop to interpret visual results and take appropriate corrective actions, processing large volumes of data from heterogeneous sources raises serious security concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[55]</ref>.</p><p>The two most common data sources for BGP data are the University of Oregon's Route Views Project <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> and RIPE Network Coordination Centre's Routing Information Service (RIS) <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref> comprising 13 and 15 out of 29 papers respectively. Seven of the 29 papers integrate both data sources into their visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">74]</ref>. The third most common data source comes from select datasets produced by CAIDA <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">7</ref> with only a handful of others using BGPmon<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">8</ref> , Spam-Tracer <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[79]</ref>, and the Maxmind GEOIP2 Database <ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">9</ref> . Several BGP visualization tools in this survey use data from several sources to integrate multiple perspectives throughout the network and more detailed data for selected network attributes. Authors of only four papers in this survey produced or collected their own BGP data through their own collector or simulated data <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">80]</ref>. One of the major challenges in this domain is how few data sources exist and how relatively difficult it is to produce unique datasets. As Wong et al. argue, "Most BGP studies so far have focused on globally visible problems using data from publicly available servers such as RouteViews" <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[80]</ref>. In this way, there is an inherent problem in validating security tools with commonly obtained and available datasets.</p><p>Another major challenge with respect to BGP security and data is the location of the data collector, which limits a visualization's perspective and which ASes are visible <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[43]</ref>. The Route Views Project, for example, has 40 collectors in its network, and visualizations that Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The visualizations used in the papers included in this systematic review, described with glyphs. A plus symbol indicates two features used in combination, while square brackets enclose a set of visualization techniques and marks used in a visualization. Thus, a paper with multiple visualizations will have multiple enclosures. Descriptions under all the equations can help in understanding the symbols, and all the symbols used are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. An interactive version of this figure can be found at https://osf.io/tupz6/. use this data source are limited to the AS relationships relative to these collectors. Tools use this data to build visualizations through the announced BGP routes and AS peering relationships. To solve this problem, Sermpezis et al. argue that "Adding monitors decreases detection delay and increases visibility of hijacks" <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[63]</ref>. With some visualization tasks requiring both a local network view of close-by or peer ASes, and a more global vantage point, Teoh et al. argue that there is a need for a system that integrates multiple viewpoints <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[73]</ref>. In sum, more data sources, more data monitors and collectors, and an integration of both local and global vantage points are needed to improve BGP visualization tool effectiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">RESULTS: CATEGORIZATION BY VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUE</head><p>AND ATTACK TYPE In this section, we present our findings from categorizing the BGP visualization tools and the attack types for which the tools were developed. We present our results in the form of the component visualization techniques and combinations used in each tool shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. We used the glyphs introduced in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> to denote each visualization technique and pictorial equations to describe the combinations of techniques used in each tool. Finally, we provide a mapping of the higher level techniques implemented in each tool to the actual attack types shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. This enables the ability to find which techniques and combinations of techniques are most used to detect certain types of attacks and where the literature is lacking. What follows is a further discussion of these results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">BGP Tool Categorization by Visualization Technique</head><p>Iteratively categorizing BGP tools by both the top level and lower level visualization techniques implemented enabled us to understand which combinations of techniques are used for particular attack types and the prevalence and frequency with which they are used. The top four techniques observed in this survey were node-link, multi-view, timeline and map. In this section we describe and give examples of each.</p><p>Node-link diagrams, which depict a network graph and the relationships among the nodes using edges, were used most frequently in tools in this survey (20 out of 29 papers). Additionally, node-link diagrams represent the most number of different encodings used as visual features to enhance the visualizations. For example, 19 of the 20 tools that use node-link graphs have labeled nodes and 12 of the 20 use categorical edges, which suggests a high user preference for level of detail or detail on-demand. In all cases, node-link graphs were combined with some other form of visualization feature or encoding to provide more information, such as node labeling and categorical edges <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[71]</ref>, varying thickness and continuous coloring of edges <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[50]</ref>, and labeled nodes with varying sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[23]</ref>. It is also interesting to note the higher frequency of pairings of node-link graphs with timelines or temporal representations (in fact, 14 of the 20 node-link tools use both in some combination), which implies that users need an understanding of the temporal changes to diagnose and identify intentional attacks from accidental routing behavior.</p><p>Multi-view visualizations, which combine different perspectives and views, such as high-and low-level graphs, and temporal aspects or topographic representations into one dashboard, represent the second highest visualization technique (17 out of 29 tools) in this survey. Multiview visualizations often combine scalable and informative approaches for long-term analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[5]</ref>, and frequently have linked views that show the relationships between data representations. For example, as one of only three tools designed to analyze BGP misconfigurations, Threshold and Merge Prefixes (TAMP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[80]</ref>, similar to BGPlay <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[14]</ref>, allows the user to playback or animate changes seen in a layered node-link tree linked with a timeline histogram. As Teoh et al. argue, linking multiple representations can help identify patterns, anomalies, and different aspects of the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[71]</ref>.</p><p>Timelines are tied for the second most used technique in this survey (17 out of 29 papers) and add temporal aspects to visualization tools necessary to understand the evolution of the AS graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[14]</ref>. They are often combined with histograms (10 of the 17 examples in this survey) when showing volume differences of update messages over time.</p><p>Maps are the fourth most used visualization technique (nine out of 29 papers in this survey) and represent a somewhat controversial topic in this domain. Bigfoot <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[67]</ref> relies on large changes in geographic footprint of AS routes. However, Papadopoulos et al. note that "not all the ASes have a publicly known country of origin" <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[55]</ref>. On the other hand, Ulmer et al. argue the advantages of geographic visualizations over conventional node-link diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[77]</ref> and, how the additional location information helps to distinguish suspicious behavior from an unintended misconfiguration <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[76]</ref>. However, there is an alternate opinion that there is not great meaning in geographic distances versus those that can be represented in a node-link graph. Colitti et al. found that "geometrical distances between ASes are largely independent from topological distances and there is no natural way to impose the position of the target AS with respect to the other ASes" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[14]</ref>. In general, map-based visualizations focus on the user task of recognizing and identifying anomalies. By using this technique, visualization designers rely on the hypothesis that changes in geographic features are noticeable to users. However, the overall effectiveness and utility of using maps in BGP security visualization tools is still argued and relatively unknown.</p><p>Category Gaps: There are no examples of BGP visualization tools that do not use one of the top four visualization techniques in some way. However, there are large gaps in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and other visualization techniques not used in this survey that could contribute to this domain. One of the goals of this study is to not only understand which techniques are most effective for different attack types, but also to identify the gaps in the literature and where visualization research can aid in developing tools for future BGP security threats.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">BGP Attack Categorization by Type</head><p>During the categorization of attacks into four types, we found that BGP terminology across the papers was notably inconsistent. For example, one common incident that was labeled differently in at least four of the twenty-nine papers was the TTNET Türk Telekom incident occurring on December 24th, 2004, in which AS9121 announced around 100 prefixes causing large swaths of the internet to be unreachable for most users for several hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[57]</ref>. Papers in this survey labeled this incident as both a Route Leak as well as a Prefix Hijack, and definitions of the two overlap in some instances <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">73]</ref>.</p><p>In some cases, we resolved this problem by using the aggregation of attack descriptions to arrive at a more specific categorization. For example, three of the twenty-nine papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">64]</ref> used an incident occurring in February 2008 in which Pakistan attempted to block YouTube from users accessing the website within their country <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[33]</ref>. Through the culmination of the descriptions and data provided in these three papers, we can categorize this incident as a Prefix Hijack and that the method used was announcing a more specific prefix. In some cases, there was either a lack of information or documentation in the papers on particular incidents or there was a disagreement in definitions between papers. Multiple studies exist that categorize BGP attacks and anomalies based on several factors including on which plane they exist (the data or control plane) and which facet they manipulate or effect (e.g. routing data, path, prefix origination etc.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">63]</ref>. More recently, Hammood et al. suggested a more complex categorization strategy that utilizes different feature selection algorithms to find out the most effective BGP features in order to identify types of anomalies <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[28]</ref>. Without more information or data on the actual BGP attack or incident itself, it is not possible to produce a more granular categorization.</p><p>Because of this paradox, we identified BGP incidents from the papers and tagged them with an overall category of Prefix Hijack, Route Leak, Misconfiguration, or Physical or Logical Outage. We added a lower-level categorization when possible from either the paper itself, combinations of descriptions from multiple papers, or collaborating open source articles.</p><p>Finally, it is interesting to note the focus of attack types, which does not follow the actual reported order of prevalence in the wild discussed in 5.1. In all, Outages represented the most supported attack type (12 of 29), closely followed by Prefix Hijack (11 of 29), and then Route Leak (9 of 29), and Misconfiguration (only 3 of 29).</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The papers we included in the systematic review, classified by high-level visualization technique and attack type.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Discussion: Tool Strengths and Weaknesses</head><p>In this section we qualitatively point out what current BGP visualization tools do well in addition to where there is room for improvement:</p><p>1. Domain characterization is solid and consistent between tools.</p><p>There is not a lot of variance in how the users, data, and tasks are represented in the literature, which suggests that these aspects are well understood.</p><p>2. The majority of tools observed in this survey did not conduct user studies. This lack of user-centered design causes a lack of confidence in how effective the visualization techniques actually are in accomplishing the defined tasks.</p><p>3. Most tools excel at detecting changes (either through changes in a node-link graph or changes in geography and routing). However, the tools lack in their ability to classify the attack or anomaly and determine if the observed issue is intentional. The overall goal is for the visualization to communicate the anomaly to the user such that they can take appropriate corrective actions. However, with both intentional attacks or even configuration changes and unintentional errors propagating in the same way, more work is needed to understand the difference.</p><p>4. There is a lack of BGP visualization tools able to model behavior or downstream effects and impacts. Because routing policy is decentralized, it is very difficult to visualize what effect a networking change will have. However, this need within the domain continues to exist.</p><p>5. More tools should be more publicly available. This will enable future researchers to build on existing capability.</p><p>6. If the use of historic attacks to evaluate tools continues, studies should provide greater detail of the attacks themselves, which will strengthen formalizations of methods and research.</p><p>7. Tools in this survey sometimes lacked a solid visualization task abstraction, which would greatly benefit the visualization design. A strong task abstraction and task clarity are paramount to effective visualization design methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[61]</ref>.</p><p>8. New BGP visualization tools should find and utilize new sources of BGP data and develop the ability to integrate multiple data sources, which will help enrich new solutions.</p><p>We intend this study to help motivate future studies, provide the groundwork to accomplish some of these lacking areas, and to emphasize the current state-of-the-art with a formalization of visualization techniques for this domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this study, we have presented a rich domain context, mapping of visualization techniques to attack types, and an initial formalization of visualization techniques for the BGP security domain. A number of challenges and future opportunities were identified in Section 6.3. This study shows the need for a better connection or mapping between the visualization techniques used and the actual attacks that were designed to be analyzed by the tools themselves. As fundamental as BGP is to routing data on the Internet, there are few BGP visualization tools in the community. We present this systematic review to encourage new visualization experts, practitioners and designers to contribute to this space. Additionally, we offer a novel methodology of mapping visualization techniques to attack types as a framework for future security related visualization studies. BGP security is ripe for more visualization implementations. Through linking the techniques used to actual attacks, we contribute the first formalization of visual techniques for the BGP security domain.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Fig.3.
