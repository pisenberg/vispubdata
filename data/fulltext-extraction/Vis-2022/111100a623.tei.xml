<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Visualization and analysis of multivariate data and their uncertainty are top research challenges in data visualization. Constructing fiber surfaces is a popular technique for multivariate data visualization that generalizes the idea of level-set visualization for univariate data to multivariate data. In this paper, we present a statistical framework to quantify positional probabilities of fibers extracted from uncertain bivariate fields. Specifically, we extend the state-of-the-art Gaussian models of uncertainty for bivariate data to other parametric distributions (e.g., uniform and Epanechnikov) and more general nonparametric probability distributions (e.g., histograms and kernel density estimation) and derive corresponding spatial probabilities of fibers. In our proposed framework, we leverage Green's theorem for closed-form computation of fiber probabilities when bivariate data are assumed to have independent parametric and nonparametric noise. Additionally, we present a nonparametric approach combined with numerical integration to study the positional probability of fibers when bivariate data are assumed to have correlated noise. For uncertainty analysis, we visualize the derived probability volumes for fibers via volume rendering and extracting level sets based on probability thresholds. We present the utility of our proposed techniques via experiments on synthetic and simulation datasets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In an era in which the growth of and dependence on data is increasing, understanding the inherent uncertainty is critical. Uncertainty can be introduced in many different ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Experimental and observational data are limited to the accuracy of the sensors. Accuracy in simulation data is a function of the model, numerical approximation, and parameters (e.g., grid resolution, number of particles) being used. Additional uncertainty can be introduced by data reduction (e.g., filtering, lossy compression), which is often used to address the challenges of big data. Further, the data are becoming increasingly more complex. Simulation data are often multivariate, with multiple scalar-, vector-, and/or tensor-quantities simulated over the spatial domain. Effective communication of uncertainty is, therefore, of paramount importance to perform risk-aware science and increase trust in scientific decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">70]</ref>. Although there have been several advances in multivariate data visualization and analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, relatively few studies have investigated the uncertainty of multivariate data <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44]</ref>. Here, we address the challenge of uncertainty visualization of bivariate scalar fields.</p><p>Fiber surfaces as proposed by Carr et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> are a well-known bivariate data visualization technique for exploring correlations among variables. Fiber surfaces generalize the idea of isosurfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> for univariate data to bivariate data. More specifically, given a bivariate function f : R 3 → R 2 with a three-dimensional (3D) spatial domain and a two-dimensional (2D) attribute space, fiber surfaces are a preimage of a user-defined fiber surface control polygon (FSCP) or trait selected in the 2D attribute space (see Sect. 2.1). We use the terms FSCP and trait interchangeably. FSCP generalizes the idea of an isovalue for univariate data to higher dimensions. In this paper, we study the uncertainty in fiber positions arising from noise in bivariate data. Our contributions in this paper are primarily motivated by the recent work by Zheng and Sadlo <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref>, who studied the positional uncertainty of fibers for uncertain bivariate fields. They proposed a closed-form uncertainty quantification framework for bivariate data fibers assuming independent/correlated Gaussian (parametric) noise models and rectangular FSCP selection (see Sect. 2.2). The probabilities of uncertain fiber positions for rectangular FSCP selection (referred to as uncertain range-fibers) were visualized with direct volume rendering and were shown to significantly deviate from the fiber positions extracted when assuming no uncertainty. One of the future directions identified by Zheng and Sadlo (see Sect. 7 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref>) included extending their work to probability distributions other than Gaussian, which we address here.</p><p>In this paper, we expand the work by Zheng and Sadlo to other parametric distributions, such as uniform and Epanechnikov, and more general nonparametric noise distributions (histograms or kernel density estimation [KDE] <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>) for arbitrary shapes of FSCP. The nonparametric models of uncertainty can provide greater accuracy than the parametric models in the context of visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45]</ref> owing to their ability to capture more realistic shapes of underlying probability distributions. Compared with the more restrictive rectangular polygon shapes, FSCP's arbitrary shapes provide an additional flexibility to choose features from the 2D attribute space and visualize their fiber surfaces. For example, Carr et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and Klacansky et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> studied fiber surface visualizations for arbitrary FSCP shapes in application domains, including chemistry and medical imaging (see Sect. 2.1).</p><p>Contributions. Our contributions in this paper are fourfold. First, we propose a closed-form statistical framework for uncertainty quantification of fibers of bivariate data when noise in data is modeled with independent parametric probability distributions, such as uniform, Epanechnikov, and Gaussian (Sect. 4). Note that our framework is applicable to FSCP with arbitrary shapes as opposed to being limited to rectangular FSCP <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">69]</ref>. Our derivations for parametric distributions act as building blocks for our derivations relevant to nonparametric distributions. Second, we present a closed-form statistical framework to derive the positional uncertainty of fibers when noise in bivariate data is modeled with independent nonparametric probability distributions (e.g., histograms or Parzen window/KDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>) (Sect. 5.1). We present our results for noise kernels, including uniform, Epanechnikov, and Gaussian. Third, we present a nonparametric statistical framework for uncertainty quantification of bivariate data fibers when noise in variables is assumed to be correlated (Sect. 5.2). We present a closedform uncertainty quantification of fibers when the noise correlation is estimated with 2D histograms, and a numerical integration technique is proposed to approximate fiber uncertainty when the noise correlation is estimated with bivariate KDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[62]</ref>. Lastly, we leverage the idea of vertex-based classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> to extract the most probable fiber surface from uncertain bivariate data (Sect. 7).</p><p>We organize our paper as follows: In Sect. 2, we define our notation and provide a brief overview of bivariate fiber surfaces (Sect. 2.1) and the state of the art in uncertainty visualization of fibers (Sect. 2.2). We then discuss relevant prior work in multivariate data and uncertainty visualization in Sect. 3. We describe our proposed frameworks for uncertainty quantification of fibers with parametric noise assumptions in Sect. 4 and nonparametric noise assumptions in Sect. 5. The memory and computational complexities of our proposed statistical techniques are discussed in Sect. 6. We describe our visualization methods in Sect. 7. Finally, we present the results of our statistical uncertainty analysis of synthetic and simulation datasets in Sect. 8 and discuss conclusions and potential future directions in Sect. 9.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BACKGROUND 2.1 Fiber Surfaces</head><p>We briefly summarize the fiber surface extraction technique proposed by Carr et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for bivariate scalar fields. Broadly, for a multivariate function f : R n → R m , the spatial domain D ⊂ R n is mapped to an attribute space A ⊂ R m . The attribute space A encodes scientific observations or simulations comprising scalar, vector, and tensor fields. In this paper, we consider bivariate scalar fields with D ⊂ R 3 and A ⊂ R 2 . Let A = {A 1 , A 2 } be the attribute space with two attributes or scalar functions A 1 and A 2 . A fiber is then defined as the inverse image of a point a = (a 1 , a 2 ) ∈ A <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49]</ref>, and it corresponds to an intersection of isosurfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> for isovalues A 1 = a 1 and</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A 2 = a 2 .</formula><p>The fibers of interest can be specified with FSCP, which we denote as a trait, T ⊂ A . Each point on a trait boundary has a corresponding fiber, and such fibers carve out or represent a fiber surface. Consider the fiber surface example illustrated for the ethandiol dataset in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, which is similar to the one by Carr et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> visualizes a continuous scatterplot <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> of the grid vertex data with the electron density (Rho) as attribute A 1 on the horizontal axis and the reduced gradient (s) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> as attribute A 2 on the vertical axis. The continuous scatterplot in all our examples is computed with the topology toolkit <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60]</ref>. The four traits {T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , T 4 } are selected as colored polygons with arbitrary shapes in an attribute space. The respective colored fiber surfaces (i.e., the set of fibers corresponding to points along the polygon boundaries) are visualized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>. The process of fiber surface extraction is similar to the process of isosurface extraction, which uses the marching cubes algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> but with a few tweaks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Initially, each grid vertex of domain D is classified as interior or exterior depending on whether the function values lie inside (interior) or outside (exterior) FSCP. Mathematically, a vertex v is classified as interior if (A 1 (v), A 2 (v)) ∈ T ; otherwise, it is classified as exterior. Such classification determines the marching cubes topology case within each grid cell for fiber surface reconstruction, and inverse linear interpolation may be applied in the attribute space A to estimate fiber surface positions on grid edges (please refer to Algorithm 1 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>). Feature level sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> generalize the idea of fiber surfaces and extract features based on distance d from trait T . For d = 0, the feature corresponds to the fiber surface itself. For d &gt; 0, features present a spatial evolution of fiber surfaces in the vicinity of trait T .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Fiber Uncertainty for Rectangular FSCP</head><p>The uncertainty in multivariate data can result in ambiguity as to whether a vertex should be classified as interior or exterior. The problem of uncertain vertex classification was recently addressed by Zheng and Sadlo <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref> and Sane et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>. Zheng and Sadlo proposed a statistical framework to compute the probability of data at point P ∈ D being in the interior of a rectangular FSCP. The computed probabilities were then visualized via direct volume rendering and referred to as uncertain range-fibers. Their analysis assumed the independent/correlated Gaussian (parametric) noise model and a rectangular shape of trait T . We illustrate the probability computation process proposed by Zheng and Sadlo in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Let random variable U = (X,Y ) denote uncertain bivariate data at position P ∈ D, where X ⊂ A 1 and Y ⊂ A 2 are the two random variables that indicate uncertain data ranges for two attributes. Let pdf X (x) and pdf Y (y) denote the probability distributions of random variables X and Y , respectively. Let the rectangular trait T be defined by ranges (a 11 , a 12 ) and (a 21 , a 22 ) for attributes A 1 and A 2 , respectively. Let Pr(U ∈ T ) denote the probability of uncertain data at point P being in the interior of a trait, which we refer to as interior probability. The interior probability (i.e., Pr(U = (X,Y ) ∈ T )) can be computed in two steps: (1) the joint probability distribution of X and Y (i.e., pdf X,Y (x, y)) is computed, and then (2) the joint probability distribution pdf X,Y (x, y) is integrated over trait T . Mathematically, the probability of point P being in the interior of a fiber surface can be expressed as the following double integral over a rectangular trait:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Pr(U = (X,Y ) ∈ T ) = a12 a11 a22 a21 pdf X,Y (x, y)dxdy (1)</formula><p>Zheng and Sadlo <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref> proposed a closed-form computation of the double integral in Equation 1 when pdf X,Y (x, y) is Gaussian distributed. Sane et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref> proposed confidence-feature level sets for Gaussian distributed data and rectangular FSCP for bivariate fields. In their technique, they considered confidence intervals of uncertain ranges at a position P (i.e., random variables X and Y ) to generate respective confidence visualizations of fiber surfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RELATED WORK</head><p>Our proposed methods mainly relate to two important research areas of scientific visualization: multivariate data visualization and uncertainty visualization. Next, we discuss prior work in each of these areas that is relevant to fiber surface visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Multivariate Data Visualization</head><p>Understanding correlations among variables is one of the main challenges in multivariate data analysis. Scatterplots <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and parallel coordinate plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> are fundamental tools that facilitate effective exploration of attribute spaces of multivariate data. Several research efforts have focused on improving challenges associated with scatterplot and parallel-coordinate plot visualization. Continuous versions of scatterplots <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and parallel coordinate plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> have been proposed to avoid sampling artifacts of their traditional discrete versions. Quadri and Rosen <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref> used topological data analysis to identify and explore clusters in scatterplots. Sauber et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref> proposed multifield graphs to study correlations among variables and their correlation strength. Data variables can be encoded into glyphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[63]</ref> to visualize a correlation in a physical domain but can suffer from occlusion and cluttering issues. Other effective alternatives for multivariate visualization include brushing of scatterplots or parallel coordinate plots and linking them with the spatial domain for exploration of correlations in a physical space. For example, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, each trait T i indicates brushing in the attribute space, and their respective visualization in physical space corresponds to a fiber surface. Hauser et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> introduced angular brushes for exploration of parallel coordinate plots and scatterplots. Kniss et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> proposed multidimensional transfer functions as a brushing technique for volume rendering of multidimensional data. Jänicke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> presented an approach for the projection of multivariate data to a 2D space (referred to as attribute clouds) followed by clustering and brushing for visualization.</p><p>We provide a brief overview of several variants and applications of fiber surfaces for visualizing multivariate data. Klacansky et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> extended the fiber surface extraction technique to tetrahedral meshes and proposed a parallel computational framework for interactive exploration of fiber surfaces. Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[65]</ref> presented a direct volume rendering framework for visualization of fiber surfaces without explicit extraction of fiber surfaces. Sakurai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref> extended the idea of flexible isosurfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> to flexible fiber surfaces for the visualization of fiber surface components of interest without occlusion. Raith et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref> applied fiber surface extraction to tensor-field invariant spaces for the visualization of tensor fields. Tierny and Carr <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref> derived fiber surfaces around the Jacobi sets of bivariate fields (a conceptual equivalent of critical points of univariate fields) for computing fiber surface topological descriptors known as Reeb spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Our literature review covered a small subset of multivariate visualizations relevant to fiber surfaces. For a comprehensive overview of multivariate data analysis and visualization, we encourage readers to refer to the survey papers by Fuchs et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and Kehrer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p></div>

The techniques detailed in this section are then leveraged as building blocks of our derivations for nonparametric noise models in Sect. 5.1. When the FSCP shape is not rectangular, the double integral in Equation 1 cannot be utilized because it considers the ranges of two attributes. For FSCP with an arbitrary shape, we apply Green's theorem to integrate the joint probability distribution pdf X,Y (x, y).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Monte Carlo Integration</head><p>In Sect. 4.1, we derived interior probabilities in closed form for parametric distributions with the uniform, Epanechnikov, and Gaussian kernels. Such analytical derivations are possible since a closed-form integration exists for each of the three kernels (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). For parametric distributions that are difficult to integrate or do not have a closed-form integration, a more generic Monte Carlo integration can be employed to obtain an approximate solution. In the Monte Carlo approach for the independent noise assumption, R samples are independently drawn from distributions pdf X (x) and pdf Y (y) at a vertex. If S samples lie in the interior of trait T , we quantify or estimate the interior probability as Pr(U ∈ T ) = S/R. This estimation technique is similar to the probabilistic marching cubes <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> technique, which estimates the spatial probability for level sets via Monte Carlo sampling of probability distributions. The accuracy of Monte Carlo solutions increases and converges with an increase in the number of samples.</p></div>

In the correlated noise case, 2D histograms or bivariate KDE can be used to capture the correlation between variables X and Y and the multimodality of their probability distributions.

Specifically, we loop through each 2D bin of a 2D histogram and quantify the amount of bin overlap with trait T by taking into account the bin extent. We then scale the quantified overlap for a 2D bin with the weight of a bin computed from a 2D histogram. Our approach here is similar to the histogram approach for the independent nonparametric case (Sect. 5.1), except that the weight of each bin is not a product pdf X (x) • pdf Y (y), but the weight computed based on a 2D histogram.</p><p>In the case of a bivariate KDE, we propose a numerical integration approach similar to the one presented in Sect. 1 of the supplementary material.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">MEMORY AND COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY</head><p>Here, we discuss the memory and computational complexity of our proposed parametric and nonparametric statistical models. Let the size of uncertain input data be D 1 × D 2 × D 3 ×V × M, where D i denotes the i th dimension of a uniform grid that represents domain D, V indicates the number of variables (V = 2 for bivariate data), and M is the number of ensemble members or noise samples that represent uncertainty in the data. For closed-form derivations with the independent parametric noise models in Sect. 4.1, we summarize M noise samples with two parameters per grid vertex. For example, we store the mean and width per vertex for a uniform distribution and the mean and standard deviation for a Gaussian distribution. Thus, for parametric noise models, the memory consumed is</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">D 1 × D 2 × D 3 × (V = 2) × 2,</formula><p>which amounts to data reduction by a factor of M/2. To compute the interior probability volume for parametric noise models, one polynomial integration is performed per trait T ⊂ A per grid vertex if uncertain data at a vertex intersect trait T . Thus, the worst-case computational complexity is proportional to the grid size (i.e., D 1 × D 2 × D 3 ).</p><p>For closed-form derivations with the independent nonparametric statistical approach (Sect. 5.1), the probability density per vertex can be estimated with KDE or histograms. For KDE, if a kernel is associated with each of the M noise samples per vertex and per variable, then the memory requirement is the same as the original data (i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">D 1 × D 2 × D 3 × (V = 2) × M).</formula><p>If nonparametric density is estimated with a histogram with B bins per vertex and per variable, then memory consumption is reduced to D 1 × D 2 × D 3 × (V = 2) × B, which amounts to data reduction by a factor of M/B. To compute the interior probability volume, the number of computations per vertex increases quadratically with the number of kernels or histogram bins owing to the nested summation in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">8</ref>(see the experiment in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>).</p><p>For the more generic Monte Carlo approach described in Sect. 4.2 and Sect. 5.1, the number of computations grows in proportion to the grid size and number of samples drawn per grid vertex (i.e., D 1 × D 2 × D 3 × S). In the case of the correlated nonparametric statistical approach (Sect. 5.2), the space complexity is again equivalent to that of the independent nonparametric approach. For 2D histograms, the number of computations grows quadratically with the number of bins because we loop through each 2D bin. For bivariate KDE, we perform numerical integration by discretizing the uncertain data range at a vertex with a uniform grid of resolution, i × i. Thus, the worst-case time complexity is proportional to D 1 × D 2 × D 3 × i × i per trait T if the uncertain data range at each grid vertex intersects trait T .</p></div>

Athawale et al. proposed a vertex-based classification framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> for extracting the most probable isosurface from uncertain scalar fields. We extend their idea for extracting the most probable fiber surface from uncertain bivariate data. Specifically, we derive the interior probability Pr(U = (X,Y ) ∈ T ) per vertex, as described in Sect. 4 and Sect. 5. We then probabilistically predict the vertex sign as + if Pr(U ∈ T ) ≥ 0.5; otherwise, we predict the vertex sign to be −.

Specifically, we draw samples from a bimodal probability distribution, in which the mode with 80% cumulative probability density is centered around the ground truth, and the mode with 20% cumulative probability density is situated relatively far away from the ground truth. Thus, the noise samples from the mode with 20% cumulative probability density denote the outlier samples. We study the uncertainty in fiber positions arising from the ensemble. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4c</ref> visualizes the fiber surface for the mean-field. The mean-field fiber surface is color-mapped with respect to its signed distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> from the ground truth fiber surface. Figs. 4d-4f visualize the results for the independent Gaussian noise assumption. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4d</ref> visualizes the interior probability volume (i.e., Pr(U ∈ T )) per grid vertex via direct volume rendering, in which yellow with higher opacity denotes positions with relatively high interior probabilities, and white with lower opacity denotes positions with relatively low interior probabilities.

The probabilistic segmentation provides insight into the probability of fiber positions being in the interior of a fiber surface for different segments. Figs. 4g-4i visualize results similar to Figs. 4d-4f for the independent nonparametric KDE with the Gaussian base kernel.</p><p>The most probable fiber surface for the nonparametric noise assumption (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4h</ref>) is spatially closer to the ground truth fiber surface (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4b</ref>) when compared with the mean-field fiber surface (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4c</ref>) and the most probable fiber surface for the parametric assumption (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4e</ref>), as is evident by the color-mapped signed distance. The result implies a greater accuracy of interior probability computations per grid vertex with the nonparametric approach than with the mean-field or parametric approach. This result is expected because the nonparametric models can capture the bimodality of the underlying noise distribution more  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> for quantitative analysis). Similarly, the most probable fiber surface for nonparametric models is spatially closer to the ground truth fiber surface than the surfaces for the mean-field and parametric models, as is evident by the color-mapped signed distance.

Specifically, we compute and plot a Euclidean 2-norm of the difference between the interior probability volume (i.e., Pr(U ∈ T ) per vertex) computed using different statistical techniques and the interior probability volume for the ground truth data, which we refer to as interior probability error. In the case of the ground truth data, the interior probability is 1 when data at a vertex lie inside trait T ; otherwise, it is 0.

Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5b</ref> visualizes the results for nonparametric KDE with uniform (red), Epanechnikov (green), and Gaussian (blue) base kernels. The dotted magenta line in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref> represents the error for the mean-field. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>, we observe that the error computed for the nonparametric approach (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5b</ref>) is consistently lower than the error computed for the parametric density assumption and mean-field (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>). The Gaussian kernel for the parametric and nonparametric statistics has the highest computational accuracy when compared with the uniform and Epanechnikov kernels. We compare the results of the Monte Carlo sampling technique (Sect. 4.2 and Sect. 5.1) with our closed-form solutions in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>, the dashed lines denote the fixed error corresponding to our proposed closed-form solutions, and the solid curves plot the error as a function of the number of Monte Carlo samples. The error computed for the Monte Carlo solutions (solid curves) converges to the one computed for our proposed analytical solutions (dashed lines) as we increase the number of Monte Carlo samples. Such convergence confirms the correctness of our derivations (Equations 4 and 8) and implementations.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> visualizes the accuracy and time curves as a result of histogram rebinning for the independent nonparametric noise assumption. At each grid vertex of the domain, we perform nonparametric density estimation by computing a histogram of ensemble members followed by the computation of interior probability. We then compute and plot the interior probability error (i.e., the Euclidean 2-norm of the difference between the interior probability volumes for the histogram noise model and the ground truth data). The number of bins determines the memory and computational requirements of the proposed nonparametric approach (Sect. 6) and impacts the accuracy. As observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6a</ref>, the error reduces as the number of histogram bins increases. Note the sharp decline in errors for a relatively small number of bins. On the other hand, the computational complexity appears to grow quadratically, as we had anticipated. Since the interior probability at each grid vertex can be computed independently, the computations can be parallelized. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6b</ref>, the red and magenta curves indicate the speed-up achieved with the OpenMP C++ parallel implementation with four and 16 threads, respectively. The GPU CUDA version of our code achieved 23X average speed-up with the NVIDIA V100 graphics card (the green curve in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6b</ref>) compared to the Power9 CPU with 16 openMP threads.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.2">Correlated Noise Models</head><p>We study the correlated noise models (Sect. 5.2) via a synthetic experiment. The experimental settings are similar to the ones for the independent noise, except the bimodal noise now comprises two correlated Gaussians (e.g., Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> in the supplementary material) with the correlation specified by covariance matrices. A correlated Gaussian with an 80% probability concentration is situated close to the ground truth, and one with 20% probability concentration is situated relatively far away from the ground truth (denoting the outliers). The noise samples drawn from such bimodal distributions are mixed with the ground truth to generate an ensemble. We observe that the ability of bivariate KDE or 2D histograms to reliably capture the correlation between random variables X and Y at each grid vertex is influenced by the number of ensemble members and by the grid resolution used for numerical integration of bivariate KDE. When the number of noise samples is relatively large (e.g., 10, 000 samples for bivariate KDE estimation in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref> of the supplementary material), the correlation is captured reliably. For fewer samples, the correlation might not be captured well and might lead to relatively large errors. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7a</ref>, the interior probability error (blue curve) reduces with an increase in the number of ensemble members. The interior probabilities computed with the independent nonparametric noise assumption (the green dotted line in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7a</ref>) appear to be more accurate than the correlated noise assumption for 50 ensemble members.</p><p>The error for nonparametric models with the correlated or independent noise assumptions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7a</ref>) is again smaller than the errors for the mean-field and parametric noise models owing to the higher robustness of nonparametric models to outliers. The mean-field for 50 ensemble members resulted in an interior probability error equal to 16.79. The parametric Gaussian noise assumption resulted in an interior probability error equal to 15.41. The error for the mean-field and parametric noise assumption does not fluctuate much with an increase in the number of ensemble members. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7b</ref> visualizes the error as a function of a grid resolution used for numerical integration in the case of bivariate KDE. The error reduces slowly with an increase in grid resolution.</p></div>

Our proposed framework extends their work to a polygonal trait with arbitrary shape. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> demonstrates the advantage of an arbitrary polygon over rectangle for trait selection in the contexts of the original as well as uncertain data. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8a</ref> visualizes a continuous scatterplot of the electron density (Rho) and reduced gradient (s) attributes of the ethanediol molecule.</p><p>The main separating axis or diagonal of the continuous scatterplot (with strong red hue in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8a</ref>) indicates regions with no chemical interactions. Thus, regions away from this axis are important for chemists in analyzing chemical interactions. The two traits T 1 and T 2 are selected in the continuous scatterplot space to enclose a nondiagonal feature. As observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8a</ref>, the arbitrary shape of a polygon allows us to select a trait (T 1 in magenta) that is closer to a nondiagonal feature than the rectangular shape of a trait (T 2 in cyan).</p><p>The fiber surfaces corresponding to traits T 1 and T 2 are visualized  for the original data in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8b</ref>. The fiber surface for the nonrectangular trait T 1 (the left image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8b</ref>) segments out carbon atoms more accurately than the fiber surface for the rectangular trait T 2 (the right image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8b</ref>). Next, we reduce the original data with the Gaussiandistributed hixel representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref>. Specifically, we partition the original data into blocks of size 2 × 2 × 2 and represent each block as a Gaussian distribution with mean and standard deviation. The fiber surfaces corresponding to traits T 1 and T 2 are visualized for the hixel representation in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8c</ref>. The carbon atoms are again segmented well for trait T 1 with the high probability (yellow) regions (the left image of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8c</ref>). The two newly formed blobs in the left image of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8c</ref> that do not exist in the left image of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8b</ref> are due to the uncertainty in data arising from the hixel representation, but they have a very low probability (purple) of existence. As observed in the right image of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8c</ref>, the rectangular trait T 2 results in an overestimation of features, i.e., a multiple high probability (yellow) regions, that do not quite correctly represent carbon atoms.</p></div>

The knowledge of eddy positions is important for oceanologists to understand the transport of energy and biogeochemical particles in oceans. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref> visualizes the results of our probabilistic analysis of fibers that represent vortical features of the Red Sea dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>. The dataset was downloaded from the IEEE SciVis Contest 2020 website (https: //kaust-vislab.github.io/SciVis2020/) and comprises ensembles of multiple variables pertinent to the oceanology simulated for 60 time steps. In this experiment, we visualize the positional uncertainty of fibers corresponding to eddy features of the Red Sea by analyzing 20 ensemble members of the velocity field for a time step of 40 over the Gulf of Aden sampled on a grid of resolution 250 × 200 × 50.</p><p>Initially, we derive the vorticity field for each ensemble member by computing the curl of the velocity field. We then compute the vorticity magnitude and Z (vertical) component of a vorticity vector per grid vertex for each member. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9a</ref> visualizes a continuous scatterplot with the mean vorticity magnitude plotted on the vertical axis and the mean Z component of vorticity vector plotted on the horizontal axis. Trait T (cyan polygon) is selected to understand the fiber positions with relatively high vorticity and a negative value of the Z component of a vorticity vector which denote anticyclonic eddy positions.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9b</ref> visualizes the mean-field fiber surface corresponding to trait T . The magenta box in the mean-field visualization indicates a rare occurrence of vortical features. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9c</ref> visualizes the results for the independent Gaussian (parametric) noise model (the same assumption as in the paper by Zheng and Sadlo <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref>), but for nonrectangular polygonal shape (our contributions). The volume rendering for the Gaussian noise model (top image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9c</ref>) indicates the presence of a relatively large number of vortical features inside the region enclosed by the magenta box because there are multiple regions with high interior probability (mapped to yellow). The probabilistic segmentation of the interior probability volume with an isosurface for isovalue 0.7 (the bottom image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9c</ref>) clearly shows the presence of multiple vortical features inside the region enclosed by the magenta box. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9d</ref> visualizes results similar to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9c</ref>, but for the independent histrogram noise model with 10 bins. Both volume rendering and probabilistic segmentation for the nonparametric noise model indicate a relatively low probability of vortical features inside the region enclosed by the magenta box. Such inconsistency regarding the presence of vortical features inside the magenta box across the three statistical models indicates the need for further eddy analysis in the same region.</p><p>We parallelized the implementation of the independent nonparametric histogram models with OpenMP C++ and CUDA using an approach similar to the one for the histogram results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>. The serial computation of interior probabilities required 83.84 seconds, whereas computations with four and 16 threads resulted in a significant speed-up with 22.21 and 6.755 seconds, respectively, of computational time.

Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref> visualizes the results of our proposed statistical techniques for the asteroid impact dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>. For our experiment, we analyze time step 189 of a simulation, in which an asteroid 250 m in diameter bursts at an elevation of 5 km above sea level and impacts the sea at an angle of 45 • (simulation series YB31 on the IEEE SciVis 2018 contest website https://sciviscontest2018.org/). We treat the dataset with resolution 460 × 280 × 240 as the reference.

Trait T denotes the positions with a relatively high volume fraction of water and temperature. Next, we partition the data into 2 × 2 × 2 bricks and summarize each brick with a probability distribution similar to the hixel technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10c</ref> visualizes the mean-field, which results in a significant loss of features caused by data variations in each brick. Figs. 10d-10f visualize the interior probabilities derived assuming the independent Epanechnikov (parametric) distribution (Sect. 4), independent histograms with two bins per variable (Sect. 5.1), and correlated histograms with two bins per variable (Sect. 5.2), respectively. Note that for the correlated 2D histograms in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10f</ref>, we compute interior probabilities in closed form, as described in Sect. 5.2. The probabilistic feature recovery with our proposed statistical frameworks is quite remarkable compared to the mean-field features, as illustrated by the boxes in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>, with Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10b</ref> as the reference. The nonparametric statistics in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10e-10f</ref> show a slightly improved recovery of probabilistic features than the parametric statistics in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10d</ref>, as anticipated based on our synthetic data experiments (e.g., Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>). A relatively small number of noise samples (here, eight per vertex) may not effectively capture noise correlation in the case of correlated nonparamertic statistics (e.g., Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>), thus yielding quite similar results in Figs. 10e-10f.</p></div>

For bivariate data with correlated noise assumption, we would like to derive closed-form solutions (instead of numerical integration) similar to the independent noise assumption, if computable. Finally, we are interested in investigating the effect of uncertainty in multivariate data on the topology of fiber surfaces.</p></div>

A continuous scatterplot for the dataset is visualized in image (a) with trait T indicated by a cyan polygon. Image (b) visualizes the ground truth fiber surface that corresponds to trait T . The ground truth dataset is mixed with random samples drawn from a bimodal noise distribution to generate an ensemble. Image (c) visualizes the mean-field fiber surface with a color-mapped signed distance from the ground truth fiber surface. The volume rendering of the interior probability volume, most probable fiber surface, and probabilistic segmentation are visualized for parametric (d)-(f) and nonparametric (g)-(i) statistical models. The volume rendering for nonparametric noise models visually represents the ground truth fiber positions more accurately than the volume rendering for parametric models (see Fig.5for quantitative analysis). Similarly, the most probable fiber surface for nonparametric models is spatially closer to the ground truth fiber surface than the surfaces for the mean-field and parametric models, as is evident by the color-mapped signed distance. The probabilistic segmentation provides insight into the positions with relatively high (opaque) or low (translucent) probability of fiber existence.</figDesc><graphic url="image-17.png" coords="6,91.78,253.03,75.56,74.89" type="bitmap" /></figure>
