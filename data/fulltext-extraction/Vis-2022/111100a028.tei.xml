<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The 2022 VGTC Visualization Service Award goes to Gautam Chaudhary for his service in critical roles for the VIS conference including Student Volunteer Chair <ref type="bibr">(2007</ref><ref type="bibr">-2008</ref><ref type="bibr">), Finance Chair (2009</ref><ref type="bibr">), Program Chair (2010</ref><ref type="bibr">-2023</ref><ref type="bibr">), Virtual Conference Chair (2020</ref><ref type="bibr">-2022)</ref> and Ombuds Committee <ref type="bibr">(2019)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2020)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2021)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2022)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2023)</ref>, as well as his service on the VGTC Executive Committee (since 2019) and the VIS Executive Committee (since 2021).</p><p>Gautam received his PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from University of California, Irvine in 2008. During graduate school and industry internships Gautam worked on wide spectrum of several meaningful and exciting projects in oceanographic visualization, multi-modality weather visualization, volume data alignment and resampling using spline interpolations, free-form sketch-based 3D modeling, and visualization of breast cancer using volumetric contrast-enhanced time-varying MRI.</p><p>Gautam's PhD work in Visualization assisted highprecision ophthalmic micro-surgery with femtosecond laser was the core foundation work that led to the formation of ophthalmic laser surgery startup company LenSx, that invented the market disrupting image guided laser surgery device for cataract surgeries. The LenSx system is a clinically proven femtosecond platform that creates reproducible outcomes for cataract and other anterior segment ophthalmic surgeries. LenSx was later acquired by Alcon, where Gautam worked on several projects and created multiple products that changed the ophthalmic laser surgical landscape forever. His product development work involved seamless integration of many diagnostic technologies, surgical planners, laser platform, wavefront measurements and guidance, and surgical data analytics. This entire surgical suite continues to perform over three million successful surgeries globally, and have improved patients lives as well as surgeons' outcomes significantly. This has made laser cataract surgery an out-patient procedure today. Gautam holds some very pivotal patents that are fundamental in the field of visualization guided ophthalmic laser surgeries.</p><p>Gautam always wanted to directly impact and improve people's lives with medical technology and he continues to work on future projects and products in that domain. Gautam continues to serve in the VIS community as Program Chair, a member of the Ombuds Committee, the VIS Executive Committee, and the VGTC Executive Committee. In his personal and professional life, Gautam is an entrepreneur at heart, a private investor, real-estate investor, and is currently working on a few technical ideas, patents and business startups of his own. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>he attended his first VIS conference in 2004 (Austin, Texas) as a student volunteer, he immediately started immersing himself in learning and participating in the conference organization. Soon he became the Student VolunteerChair (2007Chair ( -2008)), and in that role he set up several foundations that are fundamental in the VIS SV organization that you see today. He structured a formal and transparent SV selection process, created the SV day-chair roles to train future SV Chairs and a fair and transparent SV Chairs elections process, and started the SV tasks selection process where the SVs get to "select" their own tasks rather than being "given" tasks. After a very successful SV Chair role, Gautam became Finance Co-chair for VIS 2009, and in 2010 he became the VIS Conference Program Chair. As Program Chair, Gautam has played a critical role of managing the entire VIS conference's program for many years, involving several decisions that are crucial in shaping the design of the conference, and collaborating with all committee members, IEEE staff, and several external entities and vendors. Gautam helped collaborate with the presentation of papers from CG&amp;A, SIGGRAPH, and VR at the VIS conference. During his tenure as Program Chair, VIS continued to grow almost double in attendance and three times in content. It went to Europe for the first time in 2015 (and 3 times outside the US since then), turned fully virtual due to the covid pandemic, and as a hybrid conference for the first time this year (VIS-2022). Gautam's contributions as Program Chair over the years are far too many to document within such short paragraphs.</figDesc></figure>
