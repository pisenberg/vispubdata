<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>After two years of virtual conferences, we thank the VIS community for entrusting us to lead the organization of IEEE VIS 2022, the first hybrid VIS conference. VIS 2022 is about the people you meet, whether face-to-face or online. We have done our best to live this motto throughout the conference, creating time and space to greet old friends, meet new ones, and live the experiences lost to the pandemic while navigating the challenges of keeping our community safe under new and evolving conditions. In line with this theme, we implemented several new measures with an emphasis on mentorship and networking, especially for our junior members, and on expanding the successful initiatives that have increased access for our global community. These measures include the introduction of Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions, adjustments to the program structure, and simultaneous on-site and remote participation through a live-streamed hybrid experience building on the success of the virtual VIS platform from 2020 and 2021.</p><p>We owe a huge thanks to all of the members of the organizing committee for their patience and flexibility in making VIS 2022 a success. While VIS was originally scheduled to bring us to Australia, COVID forced us all to be nimble and tackle the challenge of shifting venues in addition to unique pandemic era challenges. The whole of the organizing committee</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>was tasked with respecting the unique needs of our diverse community while navigating the delicate balance of risks and benefits for on-site and online attendees. Each of the decisions and experiences involved in this process, successful or otherwise, offers the conference an opportunity to continue to improve. Special thanks goes to the Chairs of VIS 2023 whose efforts jumpstarted our own planning process, the Technical and Web Chairs whose efforts were instrumental to crafting a hybrid experience, and the Core Committee who stepped up to plan and execute the conference on a significantly shorter timeframe than in recent years. We welcome any feedback from the community that can inform future VIS conferences at info@ieeevis.org.</p><p>We offer our gratitude for the tireless efforts of all of the volunteers who made VIS 2022 possible. Hybrid VIS brought new challenges to every one of our many subcommittees. Their ingenuity made it possible to bring you the innovative research contained in this Special Issue. We especially would like to thank the student volunteers who helped execute the vision of hybrid VIS both on-site and online. Whether with waves, fistbumps, or handshakes, we hope VIS 2022 will bring a wealth of long overdue opportunities to welcome friends from whom we have been isolated for so long.</p><p>xv</p></div>		</body>
