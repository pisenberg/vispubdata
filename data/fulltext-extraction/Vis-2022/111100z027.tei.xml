<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The 2022 VGTC Visualization Lifetime Achievement Award goes to Colin Ware for shaping the significance of human perception and cognition in modern data visualization through groundbreaking research results and highly influential textbooks. Colin Ware's academic training is in perceptual psychology and computer science and he has combined this with a lifelong interest in art and design. He began his academic career as a perceptual psychologist, obtaining an MA degree from the Dalhousie University in 1974. Following this was period of two years where he attempted to be a visual artist and wrote a book on art and visual perception, which was never published but laid the foundation for his later book: Information Visualization: Perception for Design.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In 1980 Ware received his PhD in the psychology of perception from the University of Toronto from 1975 and from 1980 to 1983 he was a research scientist at the National Research Council in Ottawa. There he conducted research into human color vision in collaboration with William Cowan and began experimenting with computer graphics using an Ikonas, the very first general purpose frame-buffer based computer graphics system. He earned his MMath degree in computer science at the University of Waterloo in 1985 with a thesis on visualizing multidimensional discrete data. He was a professor of Computer Science at the University of New Brunswick for 15 years and following this he moved to found the Visualization Research Lab that is part of the Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping.</p><p>Ware's first, and most influential book, published in 2000, Information Visualization: Perception for Design has undergone substantial revisions and updates is now in its (2021) fourth edition. His second book Visual Thinking for Design describes the psychology of how humans think about using graphics displays as tools. Colin Ware's main contribution to the field of data visualization has been to propose that it should be studied as a field of applied human perception which he calls experimental semiotics. The key idea is that understanding human perception can provide insights into how data can be most effectively displayed and explored using interactive computer graphics. Together with his graduate students he has published a large number of studies on the effective use of various visual parameters such as color, texture, stereoscopic viewing and motion, as well as the visual thinking process.</p><p>In 1993 Ware developed the concept of "Fish Tank Virtual Reality" and applied it as a tool for visualizing networks. Fish Tank VR is a form of virtual reality which is not "immersive", but rather bounded and contained within the normal working environment. He also developed the concept of center of workspace interaction and applied it initially to the visualization of large graphs as part of the Nested Vision 3D system. This is a mode of interaction centered on a point just behind the screen in a 3D graphics environment. Navigation is done by means of selecting points or objects which are automatically translated to this central point for manipulation. This later became the major navigation method used in Fledermaus, software package spun off from his lab and widely used in the visualization and processing of oceanographic data. In 1994 Ware, Larry Mayer and Mark Paton, established Interactive Visualization Systems, to commercialize the software.</p><p>Work on data visualization lead to contributions to various scientific disciplines. In 2005 Ware developed TrackPlot as a tool for visualizing and analyzing the kinematics of whale foraging. A collaboration with David Wiley and many others led to discoveries relating to the underwater behavior of humpback whales, including modes of bottom, near surface, and midwater feeding. With biologist Jennifer Dijkstra he has contributed to ecology with the development of spherical space analysis and visualization, a method for understanding the affordances in interstitial spaces of seaweeds, corals and plants as refuge for small creatures. His work on the visualization of ocean flow pattern is on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC. Dr. Ware is Professor Emeritus in Computer Science at the University of New Hampshire.</p><p>xxvii</p></div>		</body>
