<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preface</head><p>This January 2023 issue of the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) contains the proceedings of IEEE VIS 2022, held in a hybrid format on October 16-21, 2022, with General Chairs from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, the University of Oklahoma, and IBM Research. With IEEE VIS 2022, the conference series is in its 33rd year.</p><p>In 2021, IEEE VIS transitioned from three colocated conferences (VAST, InfoVis, and SciVis) to one unified conference with an area model, with the major goals of allowing IEEE VIS to become more integrated, to support the continued development of the visualization and visual analytics community, and to serve as the premier conference in the field. The area model is tailored to benefit authors and reviewers by supporting a transparent and manageable submission and review process in view of the size of the unified conference, as well as an increasing number of submissions. The areas currently used by IEEE VIS are: Submissions in the new area model are handled by the Papers Chairs Committee (PCC), consisting of three overall papers chairs (OPCs) and two area papers chairs (APCs) for each area. A central part of the new structure is a single program committee (PC) spanning all areas. This year, the PC consisted of 203 international researchers covering the joint VIS areas. The timeline, review process, and publication process are identical for the six areas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Review Process</head><p>Before the formal review process commenced, the PCC made sure that papers had been submitted to an appropriate area, while carefully checking and handling conflicts of interest among the chairs. The APCs are not allowed to submit their papers to their own area to avoid any direct conflicts during the review process. As a part of this process, the PCC asked some authors to move their papers to an alternative area. In addition, the PCC reviewed papers to identify papers for desk rejection on grounds of being out of scope for the conference or for other reasons, such as plagiarism. As a consequence, 16 papers were desk rejected.</p><p>The review process consisted of two cycles to meet the quality standards of a top-level journal publication. In the first cycle, each paper was assessed by (at least) four reviewers; in special cases, additional reviewers were invited to broaden the review perspective. Two reviewers were PC members: one primary and one secondary reviewer. The APCs assigned PC members, taking into account the fit of expertise and information from the bidding phase, during which PC members expressed their interest and conflicts for submissions based on titles and abstracts. The primary and secondary reviewers then invited one external reviewer each. IEEE VIS provides optional doubleblind reviewing at the discretion of the submitting authors. In this case, the paper was anonymized for the external reviewers and only the assigned PC members knew the identity of the authors and external reviewers.</p><p>Thinking of growing our field further, sufficient diversity in representation is of high priority. Significant efforts were made to ensure that PC members included researchers from academia, industry, as well as government, and that they represented colleagues from all regions with significant VIS research. Gender balance is an issue in Computer Science and we eventually arrived at 21% female members in the VIS 2022 PC, which is better than last year but still leaves room for further improvement in the coming years.</p><p>All reviewers wrote full reviews, providing also individual scores. Based on these reviews and a discussion among the reviewers, the primary reviewer provided a summary review and a recommendation. This led to a total of 1795 full reviews. The APCs considered the individual and the summary reviews, the scores, the discussion between the reviewers, and optional confidential comments by the reviewers to prepare the decisions for the first review cycle. Synchronization and calibration between the areas was conducted in on-line meetings between the OPCs and the APCs for each area, during which particular attention was given to borderline or controversial decisions. In many cases, the APCs had additional discussions with the primary reviewers and, where needed, also read and assessed papers themselves. The list of conditionally accepted papers was approved by TVCG prior to the notification of the authors.</p><p>The authors of conditionally accepted papers revised their papers addressing required changes and submitted their revision for the second review cycle. This submission included a cover letter with a documentation of the revisions and how they took into account the issues identified in the first review cycle. The primary reviewer checked the revision as to whether the required changes were addressed successfully, wrote a review, and gave a new recommendation. Based on this second-round review, the PCC made the final decision about acceptance, which was again approved by the TVCG prior to final notification.</p><p>The VIS review process involves the critical assessment of conditionally accepted papers in the second round of reviewing and it is not guaranteed that conditionally accepted papers necessarily get accepted eventually. For some papers, the reviewers and the PCC would like to give the authors a chance to respond to comments and amend manuscripts that are borderline. It is therefore natural that for some cases the authors are not in a position to meet the requirements for acceptance in the VIS minor revision cycle and thus these papers are rejected in the second round. This year we had two cases of papers that were rejected in the second round.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Best Papers</head><p>The Best Paper Committee consists of seven members appointed by the committee chair in collaboration with the OPCs and approved by the Visualization Executive Committee (VEC). The distinguished committee members for VIS 2022 were Tamara Munzner (chair), Remco Chang, Ingrid Hotz, Petra Isenberg, Tatiana von Landesberger, Rüdiger Westermann, and Xiaoru Yuan. The committee read all reviews and the final versions of papers shortlisted by the PCC. They each ranked all the papers and met as a group to discuss and reach a consensus, selecting three Best Papers and 17 Honorable Mentions. This comprehensive yet concise paper illuminates an important visualization problem by providing empirical evidence for the link between COVID-19 forecast visualization design choices and trust: visualization design choices easily influence trust, but notably trust is not indicative of successful interpretation. The methodology is exemplary, with high ecological validity thanks to the use of real-world data, and a preregistered analysis plan for the first two studies in addition to a third study clearly labelled as exploratory. This nicely executed investigation features insightful results that include actionable design guidelines; the release of both data and analysis scripts provides a foundation for future analysis and exploration of this highly relevant topic.</p><p>• "Uncertainty-Aware Multidimensional Scaling" by David Hägele, Tim Krake, Daniel Weiskopf This clear and well-motivated paper addresses the significant open question of how to incorporate uncertainty into dimensionality reduction methods. It presents both a mathematical model and a numerical algorithm, with a detailed discussion of several visual encoding techniques that are suitable for analyzing the resulting uncertain data. The results include a detailed sensitivity analysis with a synthetic dataset, and a walkthrough of several real-world datasets to demonstrate the versatility of their algorithm and the benefits of their mathematical model. The PCC congratulates the awardees and thanks the Best Paper Committee for their work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Area Information and Area Chairs' Reflections Area 1: Theoretical &amp; Empirical</head><p>This area focuses on theoretical and empirical research topics that aim to establish the foundation of VIS as a scientific subject. Theoretical work aims to contribute to fundamental questions that relate to how we understand, assess, categorize, or formalize visualizations and visual analytics work. Empirical research aims to contribute research methodologies or concrete results of assessments of a visualization and visual analytics contribution or its context of use.</p><p>This year, after seven area transfers (with author permission), this area received 98 papers and 31 were accepted, which leads to an acceptance rate of 31.6%.</p><p>In addition to the established topic areas, including perception and cognition studies, and theory of visualization design, we observed several new concentrations. One that stood out was a set of papers drawing on observations of visualization practices and critiques "in the wild," including documenting design practices during crisis situations. Many of these accepted submissions will certainly encourage vigorous discussion in the community. Another prominent topic, continuing from last year, was solid reporting of how interpretation, trust, bias, and uncertainty are impacted by visualization designs and visualization contexts such as multiple conflicting visualizations or the presence and positioning of text labels.</p><p>The program also represents the diversity of methods in this area, including controlled laboratory studies, massively deployed online studies, deep qualitative analysis of interviews, modeling and simulation, and critical reflection on visualization design and practice. The methodological resourcefulness of our community through continued regional restrictions on face-to-face research during the Covid-19 pandemic is commendable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Area 2: Applications</head><p>This area encompasses all forms of applicationfocused research, which aims to solve an applicationmotivated technical problem, to formulate the best practice in working with domain experts to transform general-purpose visualization technology to domainspecific solutions, to design and develop visualization systems and visual analytics workflows for supporting individual applications, or to gain insight into how to adapt and optimize visualization technology to support the users in a particular application domain.</p><p>This year, after four area transfers (with author permission), this area received 103 papers and 24 were accepted, which leads to an acceptance rate of 23.3%.</p><p>Application areas of papers include multiple domain areas: biological, medical, security, engineering, sports, electric power industry, machine learning, quantum computing, digital humanities, ecommerce, finance, etc. We are glad to see that researchers from different domains are working collaboratively, and visualization and visual analytics are helping people build solutions and extract insights for various application domains. In addition to domain-specific solutions, one paper in this area focuses on comparing domain-specific perspectives on visualization design with those provided by cognition and perception, offering insights for designing domain-specific visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Area 3: Systems &amp; Rendering</head><p>This area focuses on issues around efficiently implementing effective visualization in practice. Papers proposed algorithms, system designs, and architectures that provide novel ways to create improved visualizations, with less emphasis on novel visualizations themselves. While scalability, providing approaches to efficiently handle large data, was a key theme, other themes, such as achieving improved layouts or consistency across multiple views, also emerged. These themes were seen across the range of data and application types that historically spanned the multiple tracks of the VIS conference. For example, we see methods for efficient handling of standard data types, novel devices, and layout. The area succeeded at bringing together the community based on themes, rather than application areas.</p><p>This area received 43 submissions, of which 12 were accepted giving a 27.9% acceptance rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Area 4: Representations &amp; Interaction</head><p>This area focuses on the design of visual representations and interaction techniques for different types of data, users, and visualization tasks. As well as visualization using different devices, and visual or non-visual data representation and interaction. The papers in this area cover a wide range of topics where the interaction with visual representations is crucial.</p><p>We were excited to see that, once again this year, the Representations &amp; Interaction area attracted topics that historically span all three past VIS conferences, like innovative biomedical visualization, novel visual analytics systems, and storytelling approaches. This year papers in the area combine natural language for visualization authoring and exploration, consider machine learning as a means to guide visualization exploration or authoring, explore interaction paradigms for immersive visualizations in augmented reality, expand our knowledge of visual storytelling, and of course introduce new visual representations across different domains and users.</p><p>After nine paper transfers (with author permission), our area received 75 submissions, of which 17 were conditionally accepted and 16 were finally accepted, leading to an acceptance rate of 21.3%. The number of submissions and acceptance rate are similar to that of 2021 (79 submissions, 22.8% acceptance rate).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Area 5: Data Transformations</head><p>This area focuses on the algorithms and techniques that transform data from one form to another to enable effective and efficient visual mapping as required by the intended visual representations. In principle, the source and destination data can be of any data types, such as spatial or non-spatial; continue or discrete; statistical, temporal or streaming; numerical, textual or imagery, etc. Such data transformation, which may sometimes be referred to as wrangling or munging in some other fields, may include extracting information from the source data (e.g., surface extraction from volume data, and network construction from textual data), integrating data from different sources (e.g., multi-modality registration), reorganizing data for efficient processing (e.g., hierarchical data representations), enriching data with additional information and functions (e.g., uncertainty analysis and label generation), and improving data quality and usability (e.g., data cleansing). Papers submitted to this area are normally expected to emphasize their novel contributions in terms of the algorithms and techniques for data transformation, while the work may also discuss the intended visual representations and their generation.</p><p>This area received 47 submissions, of which 15 were conditionally accepted and 15 were finally accepted, leading to an acceptance rate of 31.9%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Area 6: Analytics &amp; Decisions</head><p>This area focuses on the design and optimization of integrated workflows for visual data analysis, knowledge discovery, decision support, machine learning, and other data intelligence tasks. It addresses technical problems that cannot be solved using solely machine-centric processes or solely human-centric processes. It also addresses the need for using interactive visualization to improve the trust, interpretability, understanding of machine-centric processes and their underlying models and the need for data intelligence workflows to benefit from theoretical models and empirical findings in cognition. For example, we see work on explainable machine learning and visual analytics approaches integrating interactive visualization with machine learning, natural language processing, clustering, sequential pattern mining, and dimension reduction. We also see topics such as human-AI collaboration, analytics behavior awareness, causal analysis, privacy/trust in visualization, and knowledge-assisted visualization.</p><p>This year, this area received 94 papers, of which 21 papers were accepted. The acceptance rate was thus 22.3%.</p><p>In summary, the VIS 2022 conference has 119 accepted papers out of 460 submissions, amounting to an overall acceptance rate of 25.9%. The PCC congratulates the authors of all accepted papers and we look forward to an inspiring VIS 2022!</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>•</head><label></label><figDesc>Area 1: Theoretical &amp; Empirical • Area 2: Applications • Area 3: Systems &amp; Rendering • Area 4: Representations &amp; Interaction • Area 5: Data Transformations • Area 6: Analytics &amp; Decisions</figDesc></figure>
