<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Welcome to the January 2023 issue of the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). This is traditionally the time of the year when we feature the IEEE VIS special issue and this year is no different. As last year, IEEE VIS 2022 was tiled into six overarching areas: Theoretical &amp; Empirical (31 papers), Applications ( <ref type="formula">24</ref>), Systems &amp; Rendering (12), Representations &amp; Interaction (16), Data Transformations (15) and Analytics &amp; Decisions (21). The conference took place in Oklahoma City, OK from October 16-21, 2022 in hybrid format. Contained in this special issue are the top 119 papers selected by the unified Program Committee from a total of 460 submissions. In addition, this issue also contains the Best Paper of the 2022 IEEE Large Scale Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV) Symposium. Founded in 1990 as the IEEE Conference on Visualization, IEEE VIS has a long tradition as the premier venue where new research results in theory, methods, and applications of visualization and visual analytics are presented. TVCG and VIS have enjoyed a fruitful cooperation for more than a decade, and both the number of publications in the special issue and the number of attendees at IEEE VIS have been growing steadily. The special issue format combines speed of publication with all the established advantages of an archival journal. All papers published here have undergone a rigorous and competitive two-round review process to ensure the highest quality possible.</p><p>The benefits of the collaboration between TVCG and IEEE VIS go both ways. Not only are VIS papers published in the TVCG VIS special issue, but also authors of VIS-themed TVCG regular papers can accept our call to give an oral presentation of their work at IEEE VIS. This provides a unique opportunity for both the authors of these papers as well as for the conference audience. TVCG authors get to highlight their important work to their peers, and the conference audience gets to see more exciting VIS research and also learns about the high-quality VIS research featured in TVCG. This year, 69 TVCG regular papers were presented at IEEE VIS.</p><p>I would like to sincerely thank the many colleagues who have committed their valuable time and effort to the creation of this TVCG issue. In particular, I thank the guest editors of this special issue -the three overall papers chairs Helwig Hauser, Bongshin Lee, and Anders Ynnerman, and the 12 area chairs</p></div>

I would also like to recognize the outstanding efforts that went into the timely production of this issue by the TVCG is one of the top journals presenting important research results and state-of-the-art seminal papers in scientific and information visualization, visual analytics, computer graphics and virtual and augmented reality. TVCG is also the venue to find extended versions of the best papers of many leading conferences, symposia, and workshops in the field. Accepted papers can be orally presented at our partner conferences (see https://www.computer.org/digital-library/journals/tvcg/tvcgpartners-with-conferences). TVCG is well known for its fast reviewing cycles and for the early availability of preprints in the IEEE Computer Society Digital Library and in IEEE Xplore. TVCG offers a great opportunity for the presentation of high-profile research results and survey papers on important new topics. I encourage you to browse through www.computer.org/tvcg, to continue submitting your best work to TVCG, to consider contributing as a reviewer, and to become a personal subscriber of TVCG.</p><p>xiv</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>IEEE and IEEE Computer Society staff, especially Patrick Kellenberger, Erin Pacino, Katelyn Seyffart, and Kimberly Sperka. Thanks are also due to Christine Shaughnessy and Alison Larkin for their TVCG peer review support. Further, I would also like to acknowledge the support from behind the scenes by the IEEE VIS 2022 Conference Committee, the IEEE VGTC Executive Committee under the leadership of James Ahrens, and the IEEE Computer Society Publications Board. I would particularly like to thank the IEEE VIS 2022 Conference Co-Chairs Danielle Szafir, David Ebert, and Hendrik Strobelt, the IEEE VIS 2022 Program Co-Chairs Gautam Chaudhary and Joshua A. Levine, the IEEE VIS 2022 Executive Committee under the leadership of Ross Maciejewski and Holger Theisel, and the IEEE VIS 2022 Conference Steering Committee under the leadership of Stephen North for coordinating and working on the integration of the TVCG papers with the VIS 2022 program.</figDesc></figure>
