<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The 2022 VGTC Visualization Dissertation Award goes to Ghulam Jilani Quadri. Ghulam is a CIFellow Postdoc at the University of North Carlina-Chapel Hill, working with Dr. Danielle Szafir. He received his Ph.D. from the University of South Florida, Tampa, under the supervision of Dr. Paul Rosen. His dissertation bridges the fields of Information Visualization, HCI, and Graphical Perception to construct frameworks that consider both design decisions and the task being performed, optimizing visualization design to maximize efficacy.</p><p>Ghulam Jilani Quadri's dissertation describes experiments, techniques, and user studies to model human perception for visualization design optimization and data transformation for low-level visual tasks. The way data are visualized can influence and drastically change the conclusions people draw from them. Yet, as the findings around visualization effectiveness are nuanced, guidelines are necessary for effective visualization designs that depend on the chart type, visual channels used, and analysis tasks being performed. Most notable is the significant need to understand the intersection of these factors to create an optimized visualization which has unfolded into the following contributions:</p><p>• The first significant contribution of Ghulam's dissertation is that he identified the limitations of visualizations and visual encodings through a taxonomized state-of-the-art survey on perception-based studies focused on how visualization effectiveness is task-dependent. This work taxonomizes over 100 papers in the area, organizing them by visualization type, visual encoding, and the low-level visual analytics tasks being studied. The major impact of the work is that it provides a good entry point for new researchers in the area, revealing how significant and numerous the gaps in our knowledge are.</p><p>•</p><p>The second significant contribution of Ghulam's dissertation is the development of perceptual models for cluster detection in scatterplots and an associated design optimization tool. In his study on cluster perception in scatterplots, he demonstrated that individuals' perception of clusters depended on the data representation in the visualization in terms of visual encoding and data aspects. He then introduced models of human perception of clustering drawn from this data that serve as a bridge for visualization designers between their choice of visual encodings and how users perceive clusters. Ghulam then built a system that automatically optimizes scatterplot visualization parameters to provide perceptual optimal plots for cluster separation. The major impact of the work is a framework to facilitate visual encoding optimization to maximize the saliency of clusters by controlling design factors in the visualization.</p><p>• The third significant contribution of Ghulam's dissertation is an investigation and framework for measuring the effectiveness of data smoothing methods for a range of visual analytics tasks on line charts. He developed an analytical framework for measuring smoothing effectiveness under eight different low-level visual analytics tasks, evaluating twelve widely available smoothing algorithms. The framework helps designers understand how much relevant information is lost as the data is smoothed. He found that the best choice of method depends on both the data and the task being performed. In addition, the work provides a framework that can be used to analyze and select the most effective method for a specific dataset and tasks.</p><p>• Ghulam's dissertation's final contribution is the discussion, application, and facilitation of future research and development that has significantly impacted the important topic of task-optimized visualizations. Ultimately, the frameworks he has developed provide less ambiguous data presentations and visualization designs, leading to better quality and higher confidence in decision-making.</p><p>The dissertation and the contributing research papers can be found on his website: http://jiquadcs.com/ Ghulam's dissertation research was funded, in part, by the NSF under Grant IIS-1845204 and the Dissertation Writing Fellowship from the College of Graduate Studies at the University of South Florida.</p><p>xxxiii</p></div>		</body>
