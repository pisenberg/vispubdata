<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>A basic but fundamental challenge in flow visualization is that the perception of motion is always relative to some observer, even when this fact is not made explicit. This is not only true in special or general relativity. In Euclidean space, motion can also only be described relative to some chosen observer. This is known as Galilean relativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>An important consequence of this fact is that basic concepts, such as flow being steady (time-independent) or unsteady (time-dependent), only have meaning with respect to a given and often only implied observer. That is, if a flow is steady for some observer O 0 , another observer O 1 in relative motion will often perceive an unsteady flow.</p><p>However, these properties are of crucial importance for, e.g., the visualization of characteristic curves such as stream lines, or for line integral convolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Moreover, for features such as vortices, different feature detectors are invariant with respect to different classes of time-dependent transformations, e.g., Galilean invariance <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, or rotation invariance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. More generally, frame-indifference or objectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> commonly refers to invariance under rigid observer motion, and is considered a very desirable property of vortex detectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Given the dependence of the perception of (particle) motion on observer motion, we present a general framework for describing the relative motion of flow and multiple observers. Instead of being limited to individual observers, we introduce a continuous field of observers, relative to which an arbitrary input flow field can be analyzed and visualized. Each observer in this field corresponds to its own individual reference frame that undergoes a time-dependent rigid motion. However, instead of considering different observers separately, we represent all of them by a single time-dependent observer velocity field u(x,t) that simultaneously describes the motion of the entire observer field.</p><p>Previous work usually either used one global frame, such as a frame spinning with the average vorticity of the domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, or, on the other end of the spectrum, computed frames adapted to local neighborhoods only <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. In contrast, our concept of an observer velocity field allows combining a global optimization with local adaptivity. A single optimization parameter allows for a smooth trade-off between the two.</p><p>We define an observer in Euclidean space to be limited to rigid motions, i.e., translations and rotations, which are the isometries of Euclidean space. However, for our framework we want to consider the description of an observer by a whole vector field. A vector field that corresponds to infinitesimal isometries is called a Killing vector field <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ch. 8]</ref>, or simply a Killing field, named after Wilhelm Killing.</p><p>Given an arbitrary input flow field v(x,t), we can compute the observer field u(x,t) as a Killing field, while trying to "follow" the input flow. We define following the input flow as observing the field v from an observer field u that perceives v to be as steady as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</p><p>Outline and contributions. To follow realistic flow fields well, one observer and its rigid motion are usually not flexible enough <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. We approach this problem in the context of observer Killing fields by computing the observer field u as an approximate Killing field instead of an exact Killing field. This approach still allows each observer by itself to follow an exactly rigid motion, but in this way we allow different points in space to correspond to different observers. Nearby observers in general only approximately follow similar rigid motions.</p><p>"As steady as possible" flow means that all observers should perceive almost vanishing time derivatives. However, for this to be meaningful with respect to a general observer field u, we have to define a suitably generalized concept of an observer-relative time derivative of the input field v with respect to u. We call this the observed time derivative that we construct by building on the general concept of the Lie derivative from differential geometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. We compute an observer field u that minimizes this observed time derivative via global optimization.</p><p>An approximate observer Killing field u enables several applications of general importance in flow visualization and continuum mechanics.</p><p>(1) We introduce generalizations of the standard stream lines, path lines, streak lines, and time lines to observed characteristic curves relative to an observer field u, which enables visualizing what all observers jointly perceive. This requires introducing the concept of an observation time, with respect to which a visualization relative to the observer field is computed, because at another time the observers themselves will have moved and therefore an observer-relative visualization will be different. We note that while we mainly target approximate Killing fields, these generalizations in fact work for any general observer field.</p><p>(2) We apply the observer velocity field to the objective computation of vortices. This is enabled by the fact that our optimization is guaranteed to find the same unique observed field for any given input flow, for a chosen optimization parameter. We prove that this implies objectivity of the observed field, and thus of all properties derived from it.</p><p>Methodology. To be able to formulate our framework for a continuous field of observers, we employ methodology from differential geometry that is not commonly used in the flow visualization literature. We have already mentioned the concept of Killing fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and approximate Killing fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. See App. C (suppl. material). The second crucial concept is the Lie derivative of a tensor field with respect to the flow of a vector field. In most differential geometry textbooks, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>, the Lie derivative is only defined for timeindependent flows, also called the autonomous Lie derivative <ref type="bibr">[32, p.96]</ref>. Our framework, however, requires the less common Lie derivative for time-dependent flows, which is explained and used extensively by Marsden and Hughes <ref type="bibr">[32, p.95]</ref>. We summarize the basics in Appendix A.</p><p>Notation. The domain where a vector field is defined is a manifold M, where in this paper M = R 2 or R 3 . We denote the tangent space to M at a point x ∈ M by T x M. We extensively use the concept of the flow induced by a vector field <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. See App. B (suppl. material). In particular, we denote a time-dependent flow by ψ t,s (x), following the notation of Marsden and Hughes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, which maps the point x at time s to the corresponding point at time t, by integrating the underlying vector field along the path line through x from time s to time t. We note that in flow visualization, ψ t,s is often written as a flow map φ τ t , sometimes with the meaning ψ t+τ,t instead of ψ τ,t , which changes the meaning of (∂ /∂ s) ψ t,s , and, unlike our notation, does not have ψ −1 t,s = ψ s,t . For maps, we often use explicit notation to denote which arguments are variable, e.g., instead of ψ t,s (x) we can write t → ψ t,s (x) with s and x fixed, which defines a path line. Using the same flow ψ t,s (x), a streak line is then given by s → ψ t,s (x) with t and x fixed instead.</p><p>We denote the differential of ψ t,s by dψ t,s , also called the tangent map, or the (pointwise) push-forward <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. This is the standard concept on manifolds in differential geometry, where the push-forward of a map ψ t,s is often written as ψ t,s * . The differential is a linear map between tangent spaces. See App. B (suppl. material). In flow visualization, this map is often written as the "spatial gradient" ∇φ τ t of the flow map φ τ t . Finally, we denote the time-dependent Lie derivative by L u , and the autonomous Lie derivative by L u . See the summary in Appendix A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Flow visualization implicitly depends on an observer. This is often the lab frame observer with respect to which a vector field is initially given (computed or measured). We denote this observer by O 0 . This is crucial for considering flow as steady or unsteady, which affects all basic characteristic (integral) curves <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, such as stream, path, streak, and time lines. Many basic techniques, such as LIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, have been defined only for steady flow, although variants for unsteady flow exist, e.g., UFLIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. Texture advection techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref> specifically consider unsteady flow. The important point for us is that whether a flow is perceived as being steady or unsteady is observer-dependent.</p><p>Euclidean observers. The concept of an observer in Euclidean space has been recognized to be of importance in fluid mechanics <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> as well as in flow visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. A standard reference in continuum mechanics is Truesdell and Noll <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, who define a transformation between two observers that is often used <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. Holzapfel <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and Ogden <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> have more detailed and approachable explanations.</p><p>The concept of objectivity (frame-indifference) has been introduced with respect to this observer transformation. See Truesdell <ref type="bibr">[46, p.41]</ref>, Holzapfel <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ch. 5]</ref>, and Ogden <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ch. 2.1]</ref>. Most methods that explicitly consider observers treat only a global observer, in the sense that the observer transformation is considered to be the same everywhere.</p><p>Multiple observers. While not originally presented as such, the Galilean-invariant vortex detection method of Weinkauf et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> computes a different constant-velocity observer at each point in time and space. Each observer is computed separately, and their method is not objective. The objective method of Günther et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> computes a different rigid-motion observer for each point in time and space via optimization. However, each observer is computed separately, individually optimizing over a relatively large, constant-size neighborhood (see also Sec. 9). Bujack et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> consider multiple observers via a weighted average of vector fields seen from a finite number of certain Galileaninvariant critical points. They compute a joint visualization for all observers, which we also do (see also App. H, suppl. m.). Their method is 2D only, treats each time step individually, and is not objective.</p><p>Flow decomposition methods, such as variants of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>, can also be used to remove background flow, corresponding to the harmonic component <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. These methods treat each time step individually, without considering time derivatives.</p><p>Vortex detection. Vortex dynamics are an important topic in fluid mechanics <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, with many different criteria available for vortex detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Many methods were originally defined for steady flow, such as the method of Sujudi and Haimes <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, but some have been extended to unsteady flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Galilean invariance of these critera is considered to be important <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Other kinds of invariance have been defined as well, such as the specific kind of rotation invariance of Günther et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The more general property of objectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref> is often achieved by defining new, objective vortex criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Some criteria can be seen as being relative to a specific global observer, such as the LAVD criterion of Haller et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> that becomes objective relative to the average vorticity of the domain, which is equivalent to an observer spinning with this vorticity. The approach of Günther et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> computes an objective velocity field and its derivatives, and therefore makes all criteria computed from these properties automatically objective.</p><p>Killing fields are special vector fields whose induced flow preserves distances, i.e., they are infinitesimal isometries. In Euclidean space, they correspond to (the derivatives of) all rigid motions, which is crucial to our approach. Basics of rigid motions and Killing fields are discussed by Kilian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and Ben-Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Details are described by McInerney <ref type="bibr">[34, p.249]</ref>. More advanced presentations are given by Petersen <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, and do Carmo <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Approximate Killing fields have been used in shape deformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, shape space exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, planar as-Killing-as-possible vector fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, on curved surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and for designing approximate Killing fields on meshes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Approximate Killing fields have also been used for the decomposition of 2-tensors in a compact region of 2D Euclidean space <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and for non-rigid image registration <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. As-rigid-as-possible approaches for shape interpolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, or shape manipulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, are also similar, although they use finite (integrated) rotations instead of infinitesimal isometries. Observer velocity fields and observer world lines. Observer velocity fields describe the motions of a continuous field of observers O i , with i ∈ M, relative to some observer O 0 . We depict the world lines t → o i (t) of three observers in three observer fields u. In (a) and (b), all world lines in fact correspond to different points of the same observer, since they follow the same global rigid motion. These observer fields are exact Killing fields. The observer field in (c) exhibits world lines of observers not following the same rigid motion, and thus can only be an approximate Killing field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">VECTOR FIELDS DESCRIBING RIGID MOTIONS</head><p>We describe the motion of an observer O 1 as a Killing field u 1 (x,t), which must be interpreted relative to some other observer O 0 . In Euclidean space, the requirement that u 1 (x,t) must be a Killing field corresponds to the fact that an observer can only undergo rigid motion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Rigid body motion</head><p>The motion described by a time-dependent vector field (x,t) → u(x,t) describes a rigid motion if and only if it can be written as (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">u (x,t) = w(t) + Ω Ω Ω(t) (x − o) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where u is a vector field, w is a time-dependent vector-valued function, and x and o are points in space. The skew-symmetric tensor Ω Ω Ω(t) is the spin (vorticity) tensor at time t, corresponding to an infinitesimal rotation, like the corresponding angular velocity pseudovector ω ω ω(t) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. While x and t are variables, o is a fixed, but arbitrary, point in space. Using a fixed point o corresponds to an Eulerian viewpoint (see below). Corresponding to all rigid motions, in Euclidean space a vector field u (x,t) is a Killing field iff it can be written in the form of Eq. 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Relative observer motion</head><p>Now, instead of considering the motion of a rigid body with respect to an observer O 0 , we consider the rigid motion of another observer O 1 , again relative to the observer O 0 . While at each fixed time t, the point o must be fixed in Eq. 1, it is not necessary that o is the same point at different times. This corresponds to whether we choose to use an Eulerian or a Lagrangian perspective. We therefore rewrite Eq. 1 as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">u 1 (x,t) = w(t) + Ω Ω Ω(t) (x − o(t)) ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where now t → o(t) gives a fixed point in space for each time t, but o(t) can vary over time.

We can choose t → o(t) to describe some point o 0 that the observer O 0 perceives as stationary, i.e., as undergoing no relative motion. In general, however, the point o 0 is moving relative to O 1 . That is, O 1 sees t → o(t) = o 0 tracing out a curve, whereas for O 0 it is a fixed point. If we set o(t) = o 0 , considering x = o 0 shows that the w(t) in Eq. 2 has to be w(t) = u 1 (o 0 ,t). Thus,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">u 1 (x,t) = u 1 (o 0 ,t) + Ω Ω Ω(t) (x − o 0 ) ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where the function t → w(t) = u 1 (o 0 ,t) describes the Eulerian velocity of observer O 1 , observed at the point o 0 fixed relative to observer O 0 . However, observer O 1 will see this o 0 as different points over time.</p><p>Lagrangian viewpoint (relative to O 0 ). We can instead choose o(t) to describe the curve of a point that observer O 0 perceives as moving with O 1 , while being stationary for observer O 1 . With this o(t), the w(t) from Eq. 2 now becomes w(t) = u 1 (o 1 (t),t), and we therefore get</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">u 1 (x,t) = u 1 (o 1 (t),t) + Ω Ω Ω(t) (x − o 1 (t)) ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where now t → w(t) = u 1 (o 1 (t),t) denotes the Lagrangian velocity of the point o 1 (t) undergoing the same motion as O 1 , as perceived by O 0 .</p><p>Relationship between viewpoints. It is a crucial fact that, while the Lagrangian and the Eulerian viewpoints assign a completely different meaning to the function t → w(t), the vector field (x,t) → u 1 (x,t), given relative to the observer O 0 , is identical for both views, i.e., it is independent of whether we use the Lagrangian or the Eulerian view.</p><p>However, the Lagrangian viewpoint is what will enable us to model an entire field of observers u i (x,t) by one observer velocity field u (x,t).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">OBSERVER FIELDS</head><p>Building on the relative motion between two observers O 0 and O 1 , we now define a whole field of observers O i , again relative to the observer O 0 . See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>. We can (but need not) choose O 0 as the "lab frame" where the input field v is given. However, it is crucial to note that while some choice of O 0 is necessary to be able to specify relative motion, we can easily transform a representation relative to O 0 to one relative to any otherŌ 0 . Both will represent the same observer field.</p></div>

That is, we define an observer O i for each position x = i ∈ M on the manifold M = R 2 or R 3 . As in Sec. 3.2, the functions t → o i (t) are curves on M. We therefore choose a spatial indexing of the observers O i by choosing i = o i (t 0 ), for some arbitrarily chosen time t 0 .

Observer world lines. We can say that one fixed choice of point of each observer O i is located at o i (t) at time t, and each curve t → o i (t) describes how this point moves over time. Therefore, the curve t → o i (t) is the world line [2, p.8] of the point o i (t 0 ) of observer O i . We also say simply that it is the world line of observer O i . The world lines of all other points of observer O i can easily be computed from Eq. 10 below.</p></div>

Observer fields should be (approximate) Killing fields.

Follow the input field: minimize the observed time derivative. In order to make the observation of v as steady as possible, we want an observer field that results in a small observed time derivative D/Dt v u .</p><p>3. Regularization: match the input field. For regularization, we will match the input field as much as possible, i.e., we target small v u .</p><p>Rationale for criteria. The first two criteria correspond to the main goals for an observer field stated in the introduction: (1) The field u should be "as Killing as possible," which makes nearby observers as similar as possible, and will give visualizations with as little deformation as possible. Mathematically, this means that the Killing energy should be as small as possible. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>The observed field v u should have almost vanishing observed time derivative, i.e., be as steady as possible.</p><p>The third criterion above fulfills two purposes: (1) Choose a unique solution if there are (infinitely) many solutions with the same minimum. We choose the solution that is most similar to the input field, "following" it in this sense as well. (2) Corresponding to Eq. 23, it also helps enforce a minimal difference between the observed time derivative relative to exact rigid motion (u i ) and that of only approximately rigid motion (u).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">The notion of observation time</head><p>Our goal now is to define a general framework for visualizing the input field v relative to the observer field u, i.e., how the observers described by u perceive the field v. A crucial observation is that, in general, this cannot be done without introducing the concept of a specific time with respect to which a visualization is computed. This is not required for standard visualization without an observer field, which can be seen as the special case u ≡ 0. We call this special time the observation time r.</p><p>We can see this by considering the world lines t → o i (t) of some observers O i . These are integral curves of the field u, which we can also think of as "curved time axes" for these observers. Figs. 5 (a) and (b) depict the same trajectory (gray) of a particle moving with constant velocity relative to O 0 , but two different observer fields u (blue). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5 (a)</ref>, all observer world lines are parallel to the time axis t, which is the world line of O 0 . The visualization of the particle's trajectory in space corresponds to orthogonal projection along the vertical o i (t) to the chosen time r. Here, the choice of r is irrelevant, because orthogonal projection always gives the same curve in space (red). In contrast, for a general field u (Killing or not Killing), a particle trajectory observed in space will curve differently. That is, as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5 (b)</ref>, the visualization of the same trajectory (gray) depends, in general, on the choice of r. This fact is not restricted to a specific type of characteristic curve. It is equally true for stream lines, path lines, streak lines, and time lines. In the special case when u is Killing, visualizations of the same trajectory observed at different r will, in general, still be different. However, they will be the same up to isometries, corresponding to the symmetry group of Euclidean space <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. We note, however, that if u rotates relative to O 0 , the red path lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref> (b) will still be curved.</p><p>Choosing an observation time. A specific choice of observation time for visualization can be interpreted as visualizing the field with this time as a "reference." However, all possible choices of reference are in general equally valid. This can be understood, for example, by considering a rigid rotation over time. Some time must be picked as the reference that corresponds to "no rotation," i.e., choosing a reference line with respect to which a relative angle is defined to be 0 • , or a rotation matrix is the identity. Although often there is no natural choice, some reference must be chosen, with respect to which relative measurements can be made. Similarly, our observed time derivatives can be integrated starting from some arbitrary choice of time r (see Eq. 38). But integration must start from some initial value, where here we would start with zero. But this is true for any arbitrary choice of r.</p><p>We can also think about the meaning of an observation time r as choosing a visualization of some characteristic curve as it is observed by the observers described by u, where they were at time r. For a different time r, the same observers will themselves have moved. Therefore, their observation of the same characteristic curve will be different.</p></div>

We define s → p(s) := ψ t,s c(s) , with t fixed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref> This type of streak line is equivalent to the generalized streak lines of Wiebel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, whose seeding position is also a curve over time. </p></div>

We can of course also pre-compute the fields w r (x,t) for all possible r. This collection of vector fields can be seen as one vector field over a domain of one dimension higher, i.e., we can consider a single field w(x,t, r).

We therefore have to consider each term in the objective function Eq. 25. In the term E K we have, in fact, twice the rate-of-strain (rate-ofdeformation) tensor from continuum mechanics, which is known to be an objective second-order tensor <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Any such tensor W transforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> according toW = Q(t) W Q(t) T , where Q(t) is a timedependent orthogonal transformation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">RESULTS</head><p>We illustrate observer field-relative visualization and objective vortex detection using standard vortex measures. We have implemented the optimization as well as the computation of w r in MATLAB, solving the sparse linear system from Sec. 5.3 with a pre-conditioned incomplete Cholesky conjugate gradient solver. See <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for an overview. Our approach only requires first-order derivatives, which we compute via finite differences on a regular grid. We also estimate flow differentials via central differences, which is common in FTLE computations <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Vortex cores. Observation time fields are objective and as steady as possible. Thus, objective vortex cores can be computed in each w r with standard methods for steady flow. In 2D, we track vortex core lines in a feature flow field <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, starting at the critical points of w r where ∇w r has complex eigenvalues. In 3D, the Sujudi-Haimes criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> or parallel vectors operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> can be used in w r . Vortices can also be computed directly from v u and objective derivatives (Secs. 4.3 and 4.4).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">DISCUSSION</head><p>Performance. The timings reported in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> are from our current proof-of-concept MATLAB implementation. The optimization itself can certainly be optimized further. However, a current intrinsic limitation is that we globally optimize over all time steps, and computation time goes up with longer time sequences. In contrast, the time for computing observation time fields w r could trivially be made orders of magnitude faster by a parallel C++/OpenMP or GPU implementation.</p><p>General observer fields vs. approximate Killing fields. The approximate Killing property of the observer field u is often desirable, because it gives visualizations with as little deformation as possible, and it makes nearby observers "as similar as possible." However, the major methods presented in this paper do not depend on u being approximately Killing. They are, in fact, very general and work for any general field u. In particular, observed time derivatives (Sec. 4.3) as well as observer field-relative visualization (Sec. 6) work for any u.</p><p>Comparison with generic objective vortices <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. A major benefit of our framework is that it works globally, but implicitly still adapts locally. In contrast, the approach of Günther et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> depends on a fixed neighborhood size that is not adapted to local features of possibly different size. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 8</ref> shows a simple example where this makes a big difference. We observe an originally static rigid body rotation from an observer field that has a velocity magnitude profile modulated by a horizontal wave function. This gives an unsteady input field v, from which we reconstruct the original steady field. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 8 (d)</ref> shows the reconstruction of the original rotating field using our method. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 8 (e)</ref> shows the reconstruction using the public code provided for the method of Günther et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> using the default neighborhood size setting of 10. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have presented the first general framework for modeling a continuous, smooth field of observers for unsteady flow visualization and objective feature detection, such as objectively detecting vortices in unsteady flow fields. We compute the observer field such that it globally minimizes the observed time derivative, as perceived by the observer field. This makes the observed field as steady as possible. We see the biggest contribution of our method in the rigorous definition of the differential quantities that should be minimized in such an approach, and that we employ a single global optimization over space and time for computing the observer field such that these differential properties are globally minimized. Because of this, we do not have to specify a neighborhood size for computation, while at the same time we are not restricted to modeling a single global observer motion. We see the restriction to either a single global observer or a separate local observer per point as the biggest drawbacks of prior work targeting objectivity.</p><p>Furthermore, we believe that it is important to have a general framework available that allows visualizing directly what the modeled observers actually perceive, e.g., <ref type="figure">Fig. 1 (left)</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6 (b,d,f)</ref>. Even previous objective approaches usually visualize features, such as vortex core lines, relative to the lab frame observer O 0 for which the input was given. However, the fact that for unsteady flow one tries to compute features relative to other observers shows that it is important to also be able to visualize relative to these observers. We have shown that this goes further than computing objective vortex core lines, but enables the visualization of core lines as well as the path lines swirling around them as "stationary" curves parallel to the perceived time axis in space-time.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
