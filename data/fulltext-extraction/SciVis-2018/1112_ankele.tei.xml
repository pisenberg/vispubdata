			<abstract>
				<p>DT-MRI streamsurfaces, defined as surfaces that are everywhere tangential to the major and medium eigenvector fields, have been proposed as a tool for visualizing regions of predominantly planar behavior in diffusion tensor MRI. Even though it has long been known that their construction assumes that the involved eigenvector fields satisfy an integrability condition, it has never been tested systematically whether this condition is met in real-world data. We introduce a suitable and efficiently computable test to the visualization literature, demonstrate that it can be used to distinguish integrable from nonintegrable configurations in simulations, and apply it to whole-brain datasets of 15 healthy subjects. We conclude that streamsurface integrability is approximately satisfied in a substantial part of the brain, but not everywhere, including some regions of planarity. As a consequence, algorithms for streamsurface extraction should explicitly test local integrability. Finally, we propose a novel patch-based approch to streamsurface visualization that reduces visual artifacts, and is shown to more fully sample the extent of streamsurfaces.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Streamlines and streamsurfaces are among the first and most fundamental visualization techniques for diffusion tensor MRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. While streamlines are defined as curves that are everywhere tangential to the major eigenvector field, and are used in "linear" regions where the major eigenvalue is clearly dominant, streamsurfaces have been proposed for "planar" regions, in which the major and medium eigenvalues are similar in magnitude, but larger than the minor eigenvalue. They have been defined as surfaces that are everywhere tangential to the major and medium eigenvector fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>Despite the close analogy between streamlines and streamsurfaces, there is an important difference between them: Any generic vector field can be integrated to form streamlines, but a pair of vector fields defines a consistent surface, even locally, only if it meets a specific integrability condition, which is formulated in the Frobenius theorem, one of the fundamental theorems of differential geometry and topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Even though this fact has been pointed out already when streamsurfaces were first introduced to DT-MRI visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, its consequences for visualization have remained controversial. Some authors have reported that they were able to compute streamsurfaces without visible artifacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, and conclude that, therefore, the integrability condition is likely met in practice. A recent textbook <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> introduces streamsurfaces without even mentioning the caveat of integrability. Other authors have concluded that streamsurfaces are unsafe, based on a counter example in which the integration result strongly depended on arbitrary choices during their extraction, which they attributed to the fact that the eigenvector fields did not define a surface locally <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>The key contribution of our work is to investigate the following questions, which we consider to be critical for DT-MRI streamsurfaces as a visualization tool:</p><p>Q1 How can we test whether the integrability condition, which is a crucial assumption of DT-MRI streamsurfaces, is satisfied at a given point in a given DT-MRI dataset? The relevance of such a test was already mentioned in the original paper on streamsurfaces, which stated: "</p><p>We have yet to test if the condition is satisfied by the first two eigenvector fields because calculating the Lie bracket is nontrivial." <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> Q2 Is the failure case of DT-MRI streamsurfaces that was reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> an isolated incident, or do diffusion tensor fields from different subjects and acquisition protocols contain significant regions in which streamsurfaces cannot be used for visualization?</p><p>Q3 DT-MRI streamsurfaces have been proposed primarily to visualize regions of planar diffusion. Is the integrability condition reliably met in regions of planarity?</p><p>Q4 Do insights on streamsurface integrability suggest changes to existing algorithms for streamsurface extraction and rendering?</p><p>Section 3 answers Q1 by introducing a measure of non-integrability that we denote as ζ . Section 4 investigates Q2 and Q3 by computing ζ on an ensemble of 15 healthy subjects and correlating it with anatomical structures and regions of planarity. Finally, Section 5 discusses practical consequences for DT-MRI visualization and suggests an alternative, patch-based algorithm for streamsurface rendering (Q4), before Section 6 concludes our paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>In the visualization literature, the word streamsurface is used to refer to two different mathematical concepts. Our paper is concerned with the definition that was first provided in Zhang et al.'s work on the visualization of diffusion tensor MRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Here, streamsurfaces are defined as surfaces that are everwhere tangential to two eigenvector fields, and an algorithm is introduced that grows them from a single seed point. Sondershaus and Gumhold prefer to call these surfaces diffusion surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> to reduce the risk of confusing them with the second definition of streamsurfaces, which is discussed below. Vilanova et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> propose an algorithm that switches between creating streamlines and streamsurfaces in a data-adaptive manner.</p><p>Our work relies on the Lie bracket of the first two eigenvector fields. This goes back to well-known results from differential topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and its relevance for DT-MRI streamsurfaces was pointed out already by Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. However, this test has never been performed in practice, nor have its implications for DT-MRI visualization been studied. Our work is inspired by papers outside of visualization, which used the Lie bracket to define a Sheet Probability Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> in the context of the sheet structure hypothesis, which states that fiber bundles in the brain form parallel sheets of interwoven paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. These works did not compute the Lie bracket for the major and medium eigenvector fields, but for different pairs of vector fields that result from a multifiber model and may be non-orthogonal. In our own recent work, we argue that, even though DT-MRI cannot resolve fiber crossings, it can be used to derive an alternative Sheet Probability Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Unlike this prior work, our present paper investigates DT-MRI streamsurfaces as a visualization technique. Section 5.1 will put our present main findings into context of those from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>In vector field visualization, the word streamsurface refers to surfaces that are generated by advecting a given seeding curve along a vector field <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In the context of stress tensors from geomechanics, this concept has also been applied to the visualization of eigenvector fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The problem of integrability, which is at the core of our paper, does not affect streamsurfaces in this second sense, due to their completely different definition. However, as we will discuss in more detail in Section 5.2, our work is related to attempts of finding surfaces that are as perpendicular as possible to 3D steady vector fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">TESTING DT-MRI STREAMSURFACE INTEGRABILITY</head><p>This section addresses Q1 by introducing the normal part of the Lie bracket, which we denote ζ , to the visualization literature. It is relevant for DT-MRI streamsurface visualization because it can serve as a measure of surface nonintegrability.</p><p>We start with examples that illustrate the problem of DT-MRI streamsurface integrability (Section 3.1). To make our paper more self-contained, Section 3.2 introduces the involved mathematical concepts, before Section 3.3 goes into detail on the detection and practical computation of ζ . Section 3.4 establishes a novel theoretical result on the sign of the Lie bracket of eigenvector fields, which is relevant to our experiments later on.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The Problem of DT-MRI Streamsurface Integrability</head><p>When Zhang et al. introduced DT-MRI streamsurfaces, they described them as "the approximation of the surface that extends along both the major eigenvector field and medium eigenvector field. At any point on a streamsurface, the major and medium eigenvectors lie in the tangent plane to the surface" <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Most subsequent publications simply defined streamsurfaces as the surfaces that result from the previously proposed algorithm for their extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, or assumed that they are intuitively understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>In order to discuss the problem of DT-MRI streamsurface integrability, we require a more formal mathematical definition. Based on the explanation above, the following definition seems natural:</p><p>Definition 1: Given a smooth symmetric 3D tensor field D :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Ω → R 3×3</formula><p>Sym defined on Ω ⊂ R 3 , a DT-MRI streamsurface S seeded at point p ∈ Ω is a two-manifold that is embedded in Ω, includes p, and is locally tangent to the major and medium eigenvector fields of D at all points on S .</p><p>An obvious problem with this definition arises at tensor degeneracies: When the smaller two eigenvalues are equal, λ 2 = λ 3 , the corresponding eigenvectors can be rotated freely within a two-dimensional subspace. Thus, the tangential plane specified in Definition 1 is no longer unique. Since streamsurfaces were introduced to visualize regions of planarity, this problem can be avoided by restricting Ω to a subdomain on which diffusion tensor planarity, as defined by Westin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">c p := λ 2 − λ 3 λ 1<label>(1)</label></formula><p>is greater than a suitable threshold. However, even in regions of high c p , the problem of surface integrability might remain. It refers to the fact that a given pair of vector fields may not permit a surface whose tangential plane includes both vectors everywhere. This is true even if the pairs of vectors are everywhere orthogonal, as in the case of eigenvector fields derived from the same symmetric tensor field.</p><p>We present an initial experiment that introduces and illustrates this problem along with several implications that will be discussed more formally and in more detail later on. In particular, we illustrate the problem of surface integrability by integrating two sets of curves whose tangents remain within the plane spanned by the two eigenvectors, and which will form a grid on 1 cm 2 large streamsurface patches if the underlying vector fields permit such a surface. Even though this exact patch size is arbitrary, we chose its order of magnitude in the spirit of a necessary condition for the practical utility of DT-MRI streamsurfaces based on typical voxel sizes in DT-MRI data (≈ 2 mm in clinical data) and our opinion that a clear failure to integrate streamsurfaces across even just a few neighboring voxels should discourage their use.</p><p>The corresponding curves are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, and are created by the following algorithm: . The problem of streamsurface integrability can be illustrated by tracing curves that will form a grid if a surface can be integrated from the major and medium eigenvector fields, as it is approximately true in (a) and (b). Otherwise, horizontal and vertical curves will diverge, as it can be seen especially in the lateral views (bottom row) of (c) and (d). Colors indicate |ζ |, our proposed measure of nonintegrability, from 0 (integrable, blue) over 0.1 (white) to 0.2 or greater (red).</p><p>1. Determine the major and medium eigenvector directions X and Y at a given seed point p.</p><p>2. Starting at p, use the numerical method whose details are given in Step 4 to integrate seed curves that are as straight as possible, while remaining tangential to the plane spanned by the local major and medium eigenvectors. Extend these curves for 5 mm in steps of 0.25 mm, starting in positive and negative X and Y directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">At each vertex of each seed curve found in</head><p>Step 2, determine a vector v that is within the plane spanned by the local major and medium eigenvectors, but orthogonal to the tangent of the curve. Use the numerical method from Step 4 to integrate curves that start at each vertex of the seed curves in positive and negative v direction, again for 5 mm and in steps of 0.25 mm.</p><p>4. Numerical integration is performed using second-order Runge-Kutta <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The tensor field is interpolated with a cubic B-spline kernel <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and the propagation direction is given by the most recent tangent of the curve, projected to the plane spanned by the major and medium eigenvectors, and renormalized. To avoid artifacts in regions of singularities (λ 2 = λ 3 ), integration is terminated if c p &lt; 0.2.</p><p>Step 4 of this algorithm is analogous to the integration in standard DT-MRI streamsurface algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. Note that the resulting curves are not streamlines of the major and medium eigenvector fields. Rather, they are defined in such a way that they will intersect each other in a grid if major and medium eigenvector fields permit a streamsurface according to Definition 1. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> (a) and (b), this is (approximately) the case. The bottom rows of the subfigures show the same patches as the top rows, but from the side, to make it easier to see whether the curves actually intersect, or bend away from each other, as it happens in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> (c) and (d).</p><p>In generic tensor fields, we cannot expect to find streamsurfaces according to Definition 1 since, in the absence of further constraints, it is extremely unlikely that a pair of eigenvector fields will permit a surface that is tangential to both eigenvectors at all points. This fact will be formally discussed in Section 3.4, and is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1 (d)</ref>, which shows results from a random tensor field. It was generated by drawing eigenvalues in range [0, 1] uniformly at random, and a random orthonormal set of eigenvectors, at each vertex of a provisional voxel grid. A final smooth tensor field was created by upsampling the result by factor 10 with a cubic B-spline kernel <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In this case, our set of curves clearly does not form a common surface, and the shown result is representative of different random seeds.</p><p>Despite this, at least some seed positions in a real-world DT-MRI dataset lead to (approximate) streamsurface patches, such as those shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> (a) and (b). Small deviations are still present, but should be seen in the context of Section 4.1, which will show that we have to admit small deviations between the tangent planes of S and the eigenvector fields to account for measurement noise even in cases where the underlying physical phenomenon (e.g., brain anatomy) might constrain the tensor field in such a way that streamsurfaces in the sense of Definition 1 emerge.</p><p>Subfigure (a) is from a crossing fiber region in the Corona Radiata (CR); <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> presents a crossing fiber visualization in that same region. In this example, the fact that the curves approximate a grid might be attributed to the observation that they are relatively straight overall. The patch in Subfigure (b), which has been extracted from a seed point near a sulcus in the temporal lobe, exhibits more substantial curvature, which is reflected equally in both sets of curves, so that again only moderate deviations occur between them. However, even in DT-MRI data, emergence of streamsurface patches is not universal: The curves in Subfigure (c) are seeded in a region in which the Corpus Callosum (CC) and Corticospinal Tract (CST) cross. They very clearly bend away from each other, despite the fact that our algorithm stops integration when c p &lt; 0.2.</p><p>We emphasize that the diverging behavior in Subfigures 1 (c) and (d) is dominated by the fact that the underlying vector fields do not form a consistent surface, not by numerical errors. It cannot be fixed by using higher-order Runge-Kutta or smaller integration steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Introduction to the Lie Bracket</head><p>Our test for whether or not the major and medium eigenvector fields can locally be integrated into a streamsurface relies on concepts from differential geometry and topology, where the condition under which a surface can be constructed from any pair of differentiable vector fields X and Y has been established by Frobenius integrability theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. It uses their Lie bracket [X, Y], which is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">[X, Y] = ∇ X Y − ∇ Y X (2) = ∑ i, j (X i ∂ i )(Y j e j ) − (Y i ∂ i )(X j e j )<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">= ∑ i, j (X i ∂ i Y j −Y i ∂ i X j )e j ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>with canonical basis vectors e j . An intuitive interpretation of the bracket can be given in terms of the flow map Φ, which is a well-established concept in the visualization literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, and illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> (left): Given a vector field X, the corresponding flow Φ maps each point p to its integral curve Φ t (p), which is everywhere tangential to X and starts at Φ 0 (p) = p. This will result in a closed loop if Φ and Ψ commute, which is indicated by a vanishing Lie bracket:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">[X, Y] = 0<label>(5)</label></formula><p>In fact, the difference between starting point p and end point q can be approximated based on the bracket as <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">q − p = h 2 [X, Y] + O(h 3 )<label>(6)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">The Normal Part of the Lie Bracket as a Measure of Nonintegrability</head><p>Assuming that X, Y are linearly independent, we want to know if a surface exists with ∆ p = span(X p , Y p ) as its tangential plane at every point p. According to Frobenius integrability theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 6</ref>] such a surface exists iff</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">[X, Y] ∈ span(X, Y) .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>This makes the normal component of the Lie bracket</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">[X, Y] N = [X, Y], X × Y X × Y<label>(8)</label></formula><p>a natural measure of nonintegrability, since X, Y describe a surface iff</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">[X, Y] N = 0.</formula><p>In the special case that</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">X = v 1 , Y = v 2 , Z = v 3</formula><p>are the three orthonormal eigenvector fields of a symmetric second order tensor field D, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">[X, Y] N = [X, Y], Z =: ζ .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>In the remainder of this paper, we will use ζ as our measure of nonintegrability. An equation for its practical computation is derived in Appendix A. We note that ζ only depends on the change of orientation of the spanned planes and is measured in units of length −1 . Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>allows us to give an intuitive meaning to its value. For ζ = 0.1 mm −1 , trying to follow a path around a square of area 1 mm 2 leads ≈ 0.1 mm into the normal direction. Because Equation (6) is quadratic in h, an area of 1 cm 2 already leads ≈ 1 cm outwards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Interpreting the Sign of ζ</head><p>In this section, we argue that the sign of ζ is uniquely defined, and has a clear interpretation: According to Equation (9), it indicates whether the normal part of the Lie bracket is parallel or anti-parallel to the third eigenvector Z. Since Z itself lacks an intrinsic orientation, i.e., Z and −Z equally satisfy the eigenvector equation DZ = λ 3 Z, it might at first seem that the sign of ζ is arbitrary also. However, we will show that, as long as we require the three orthogonal eigenvector fields to form a right-handed system, inverting the sign of Z necessarily inverts the sign of the Lie bracket. Thus, the overall sign of ζ is preserved, since it reflects the relative orientation of these two vectors. We state this as Theorem 1: Assuming that the eigenvector fields are defined so that they form a right-handed system, ζ has a well-defined sign, and is continuous almost everywhere.</p><p>The proof is based on the observation that, even though picking the eigenvector fields to be right-handed does not orient Z, it makes it impossible to invert the sign of Z in isolation, since that would make the system left-handed. Rather, we will have to invert the sign of exactly one other eigenvector field also. Now, we observe that Equation <ref type="formula">28</ref>reformulates ζ as a sum of two products, each of which involves each eigenvector field, or its derivative, exactly once. This means that signs introduced when flipping pairs of eigenvectors will cancel out during computation of ζ .</p><p>Moreover, Appendix A computes ζ as a continuous function of the derivatives of a smooth tensor field, as well as its sorted eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are locally continuous functions of the tensor field almost everywhere, except at the singularities that arise when at least two eigenvalues are equal <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. It is known that these singularities generically occur along curves in 3D symmetric tensor fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Away from these singularities, ζ is a continuous signed quantity.</p><p>We emphasize that our theorem does not follow directly from Theorem 1 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, which states that, on any simply-connected component on which tensors are sufficiently planar, Z can be converted into a continuous vector field. The key issue is that this conversion is not unique: It still leaves us with the choice of inverting the sign everywhere on the component. Our theorem states that this remaining ambiguity does not affect ζ . In Section 4.3, this allows us to compare ζ (as a signed quantity) across different subjects without having to worry about how to consistently orient eigenvectors in different datasets.</p><p>Note that the fact that the three eigenvector fields are everywhere orthogonal simplifies computation of ζ , but does not restrict its sign or value. This implies that, in a generic tensor field, we have to expect that ζ will fluctuate freely. This in turn indicates that generic tensor fields do not contain streamsurfaces in the sense of Definition 1, as it has been illustrated with the random tensor field in Section 3.1.</p><p>Theorem 1 also has an important consequence for correctly interpreting spatial maps of |ζ |, which will be shown in Section 4.2: Even when the eigenvector fields are nonintegrable everywhere, we have to expect that zero isosurfaces will show up in such maps, since ζ is signed and continuous almost everywhere. These zero isosurfaces do not correspond to integrable surfaces in the eigenvector fields, since the eigenvectors will generally not be tangential to them. Rather, streamsurface integrability in a given region should be indicated by the fact that ζ is zero throughout that region, not just along isolated surfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF STREAMSURFACE INTEGRABILITY</head><p>After introducing ζ as a nonintegrability measure for DT-MRI streamsurfaces, we will now use it to study the applicability of streamsurface visualizations in real-world data much more systematically than in previous works, which only highlighted individual cases where trying to integrate streamsurfaces seemed to work well <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, or where it resulted in visible artifacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Section 4.1 confirms the practical applicability of ζ via a quantitative evaluation in simulated data. We then study question Q2 based on whole-brain maps of ζ in a group of subjects. Section 4.2 shows qualitative results on a representative subject, Section 4.3 reports quantitative results from a statistical group analysis. Proceeding to question Q3, Section 4.4 clarifies how tensor planarity in the sense of Equation (1) relates to streamsurface integrability. Finally, Section 4.5 shows that our main findings are replicated on data from a different scanner and measurement setup.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Quantitative Evaluation on Simulated Data</head><p>We established that no streamsurfaces can be expected in generic tensor fields. However, it has been observed previously that constraints from the underlying neuroanatomy make diffusion tensor fields behave differently than purely random tensor fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. This might explain why <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1 (a)</ref> and (b) still suggest that meaningful streamsurfaces exist in real-world DT-MRI data. However, even if we assume an exact value of ζ = 0 based on the underlying structures, we have to expect that measurement noise will induce small deviations from zero. In order to establish a threshold |ζ | &lt; Θ that characterizes regions in which we consider nonintegrability to be low enough to still use streamsurfaces for visualization, we have to assess the expected effect of measurement noise on ζ .</p><p>To this end, we constructed perfectly planar tensors (λ 1 = λ 2 λ 3 ) from two orthonormal sets of three eigenvector fields X, Y, Z, so that the tangential planes of the intended streamsurfaces would be spanned by X and Y. Based on these tensors and measurement settings from a clinical protocol, we simulated DW-MRI data sets (30 DWIs). After adding varying levels of noise, diffusion tensors were fitted, and we compared the values of ζ computed from the equations in Appendix A to their analytical ground truth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Integrable Case: Concentric Spheres</head><p>When choosing the normal field to be the normalized radial field</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Z(p) = p p ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>the X-Y-planes are tangential to concentric spheres around the origin. This configuration is obviously integrable and we expect ζ ≡ 0. Based on these plots, computed values of ζ appear unbiased (i.e., close to the ground truth value of zero on average). Unsurprisingly, variance increases with the level of measurement noise in the data. For small radii, we observe errors in the computed values of ζ even in the noise-free case. This can be explained by the onset of discretization artifacts as the streamsurface curvature increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Nonintegrable Case: Linear Rotation Field</head><p>A nonintegrable configuration can be constructed by rotating the standard frame e x , e y , e z by an angle θ (x) = θ x around the x-axis:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">X = e x<label>(</label></formula><p>11) Y = cos θ e y + sin θ e z (12) Z = cos θ e z − sin θ e y .</p><p>In this case, the analytical ground truth is ζ = θ , as derived in Appendix B. The results of estimating ζ from fields with varying rotation speed θ and different levels of added noise can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>. Again, empirical values are reasonably centered on the ground truth, with a variance that depends on the level of measurement noise, as well as on errors from spatial discretization, which increase with rotation speed θ .</p><p>Given the observed standard deviations at realistic noise levels (e.g., SNR=20), we can expect that empirical values of ζ will allow us to reliably distinguish between the integrable case shown at the bottom of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, and the nonintegrable one at the bottom of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>. However, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> also illustrates that, even in cases where neuroanatomy would induce streamsurfaces in high-quality data, high levels of measurement noise might make it impossible to observe them.</p><p>In the remainder of our paper, we will use |ζ | &lt; 0.1 as a threshold for streamsurface integrability. This is motivated in two ways: First, it is clear from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> that, even if the anatomical structures that are reflected in a diffusion tensor field induce integrable surfaces, we have to expect deviations on this order of magnitude because of the measurement noise. Second, we visually explored a large number of patches with the algorithm from Section 3.1 and used different values of ζ as an additional termination criterion. We found that |ζ | &lt; 0.1 limited deviations on a 1 cm 2 patch to a level where the curves still formed visually plausible surfaces.</p><p>Based on its definition, ζ is measured in units of [length] −1 , so thresholds on |ζ | should only depend on the level of noise in the data, not on the spatial resolution of the sampling grid, as long as derivatives are computed with respect to the proper physical units of length.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Spatial Extent of Nonintegrability</head><p>To investigate where in the brain integrable or non-integrable behavior can be found, we color mapped ζ on whole-brain DT-MRI datasets from 15 healthy subjects, which were taken from the publicly available Human Connectome Project (HCP) database <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The diffusion MRI acquisition scheme of the HCP includes 90 diffusion-weighted images each at b values of b ≈ {1000, 2000, 3000} s/mm 2 , as well as 18 images with minimal diffusion weighting, b ≈ 5. The spatial resolution is (1.25 mm) 3 isotropic. Since the diffusion tensor model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> has been designed for b values up to b ≈ 1000, we only used the corresponding part of the data to estimate the tensors.</p><p>ζ is a nonlinear function of the tensor field and its derivatives. Similar to ridges and valleys in tensor invariants <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, it contains much higher spatial frequencies than the underlying tensor field itself. For this reason, we sampled it on a grid that, along each axis, was four times as fine as the original voxel grid. As before, upsampling used cubic B-splines. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> presents results from a representative subject. To provide anatomical context, the left column shows a standard XYZ-RGB color coding of the principal eigenvector direction, indicating left-right as red, anterior-posterior as green, and superior-inferior as blue. In the right column, |ζ | has been overlaid in black, with linearly increasing opacity so that |ζ | = 0 is shown transparent, |ζ | ≥ 0.1 with opacity α = 0.5. The resulting maps show several extended regions where |ζ | is consistently low and streamsurface integration may reasonably be attempted. However, there are also many regions that indicate high values of |ζ | or exhibit a fine-grained texture, indicating high amplitude oscillations around zero. As explained in Section 3.4, this indicates that trying to integrate streamsurfaces in those regions would lead to strong artifacts, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1 (c)</ref> and (d).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Between-Subject Variability</head><p>When visually comparing all 15 subjects, we observed similar overall patterns in maps of ζ . In particular, we noticed extended anatomical regions in which |ζ | appeared to be high in all subjects. This motivated a more formal statistical analysis, whose results are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>.</p><p>We brought the maps from different subjects into anatomical correspondence using the established and publicly available nonlinear registration algorithm FNIRT, which is part of FSL <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In particular, we registered brain extracted Fractional Anisotropy (FA) maps from all subjects to the FMRIB58 FA template provided with FSL, and applied the same transformations to the maps of ζ , which warps them to a common reference space with 1 mm isotropic voxel size.</p><p>In this common space, we performed a voxel-wise one-sample t-test of the null hypothesis that the local mean of ζ across subjects is zero. This null hypothesis is justified by observing that ζ is intrinsically signed (cf. Theorem 1) and there is no reason why noise should perturb it more frequently or more strongly in one direction than the other. If the mean across subjects deviates from zero despite this, the t-test judges the significance of this deviation by relating it to the number of included subjects, and the observed variability between them. We accounted for the multiple comparisons (one per voxel) by imposing a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Red regions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref> (a) indicate locations where the null hypothesis was rejected, overlaid on the FA template. We identified several spatial clusters, which arose symmetrically in both hemispheres. Two of the clusters are marked with arrows, an anterior one in light blue, a posterior one in yellow. To identify the tracts that these clusters belong to, we warped the clusters back into the image space of one particular subject, and used them as seeds for fiber tractography. Since a large fraction of white matter voxels contain more than a single dominant fiber orientation, and diffusion tensor tractography is known to be unable to accommodate this fact <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, tractography is based on a state-of-the-art deconvolution approach that makes use of all available diffusion measurements in the HCP data <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Results are shown in Subfigures (b) and (c). They suggest that the anterior region is part of the anterior thalamic radiation; in the posterior region, fibers from the corpus callosum and the corticospinal tract mix.</p><p>Concerning Q2, we conclude from this experiment that the previously observed failure case of DT-MRI streamsurface integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> is not a rare and isolated problem. Rather, our results clearly identify anatomical regions in which streamsurface integrability is violated in a statistically significant sense, in a whole group of subjects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Correlation with Diffusion Tensor Planarity</head><p>We now turn to question Q3. Given that streamsurfaces have been proposed for regions of sufficiently large diffusion tensor planarity c p , we should clarify whether regions of nonintegrability, as they were shown in the previous subsections, may be restricted to regions of low c p , which would make the issue less relevant for visualization. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref> visualizes the relationship between c p and |ζ | with a bivariate color map that is adapted to the thresholds used throughout our paper. Fully saturated green indicates c p ≥ 0.2, i.e., regions where we consider planarity large enough for streamsurface integration. Fully saturated magenta stands for |ζ | ≥ 0.1, i.e., regions where nonintegrability is so large that no meaningful streamsurfaces exist. In fact, green and magenta dominate the maps, indicating that nonintegrability mostly affects regions of low tensor planarity.</p><p>We also confirmed this quantitatively, based on the joint histogram in the bottom right corner of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref>. It shows values from the full volume, and the full range of c p and |ζ |, whose infinite range has been compressed using the arctan. The Pearson correlation between arctan |ζ | and c p is ρ = −0.41.</p><p>However, despite this negative overall correlation, there are nonnegligible regions that show up in black in the slice images, indicating significant nonintegrability even though c p is above our threshold. In these regions, we may be tempted to integrate streamsurfaces even though they are not meaningful. This settles Q3: The integrability condition is not reliably met in regions of planarity. We believe that this insight needs to be accounted for in streamsurface visualizations, and will suggest specific consequences in Section 5. . Comparing nonintegrability |ζ | and diffusion tensor planarity c p with a bivariate color map reveals that most regions exhibit either high planarity (green) or nonintegrability (magenta). However, there clearly exist regions, shown in black, where the major and medium eigenvector fields are nonintegrable despite high c p . A joint histogram of both measures, computed over the full volume, confirms these observations. <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>. Nonintegrability ζ can also be computed from data that has been acquired with a standard clinical DT-MRI protocol. Also in this case, bivariate color mapping and a joint histogram clearly indicate regions of nonintegrability despite high c p , shown in black in the sagittal map on the left (please refer to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref> for a full legend)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Impact of Data Acquisition Protocol</head><p>All experiments above used data from the Human Connectome Project, which has higher quality than the data on which DT-MRI streamsurfaces have been reported in the literature previously. In particular, it has been acquired with a highly modified Siemens 3T Skyra scanner that was specifically optimized for diffusion MRI, and provides higher spatial and angular resolution than typical clinical data <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. We verified that our main findings still hold when using data that has been acquired on a widely used clinical MR scanner (3T Philips Achieva) with a standard DT-MRI protocol: 32 diffusion-weighted directions with b = 1000, one reference scan with b = 0, spatial resolution (2 mm) 3 isotropic.</p><p>Results on this clinical data are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. Structures in the brain map (left) have a coarser appearance than in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref>, reflecting the reduced spatial resolution. Despite this, our main findings carry over: Beside regions that are either non-planar and nonintegrable (magenta) or planar and integrable (green), we still observe non-negligible regions in which streamsurfaces are ill-defined despite high c p (black). The joint distribution of arctan |ζ | and c p (right) exhibits a similar pattern as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref>.</p><p>Adressing Q4, we will now propose a novel, patch-based approach to DT-MRI streamsurface visualization. However, we believe that another issue is at least as important as algorithmic aspects, and should be discussed first: When and how should DT-MRI streamsurfaces be used, and how might they be interpreted?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Streamsurfaces in Visualization: When, How, and Why</head><p>Three important insights from our analysis can be summarized as:</p><p>I1 There are brain regions in which the extent of nonintegrability is small enough that it might be attributed to the effects of measurement noise. In these regions, major and medium eigenvector fields define small streamsurface patches with a visually satisfactory accuracy (cf. Sections 3.1, 4.1 and 4.3). I2 There are other, non-negligible regions where, despite high values of diffusion planarity c p , the major and medium eigenvector fields do not define meaningful streamsurfaces, not even on relatively small (1 cm 2 ) patches (cf. Sections 3.1 and 4.4). I3 Even small amounts of nonintegrability will accumulate rapidly over larger distances (cf. quadratic dependence in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>).</p><p>From these, we draw three main conclusions on when and how to use streamsurfaces for DT-MRI visualization:</p><p>C1 When they are used to visualize small patches in certain brain regions, we consider streamsurfaces to be a meaningful visualization technique despite the failure case reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. C2 Algorithms for integrating streamsurfaces should not only check that c p is sufficiently high, as it has been done previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>, but also that nonintegrability |ζ | is sufficiently low. Appendix A can be used for practical computation of ζ , and Section 4.1 as well as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> support its applicability. C3 When interpreting visualizations of larger streamsurfaces, users have to account for the potential consequences of accumulating nonintegrability.</p><p>We emphasize that C3 is more fundamental than the problem of accumulating integration errors that also affect the widely used streamline visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. At least, we know that white matter contains curvelike anatomical structures (fiber tracts), and the question is merely whether streamlines correctly follow them. When showing streamsurfaces, we are not even certain that surface-like anatomical structures exist that they could correspond to.</p><p>What might be a valid interpretation of DT-MRI streamsurfaces in terms of brain anatomy? Zhang et al. point out that planar diffusion anisotropy "could result from a surface structure, a boundary between different materials, or a crossing of multiple linear features" <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. This is true, but applies to the microscale, which is probed by the diffusion. It does not necessarily imply that surface structures exist at the macroscopic scale, at which DT-MRI streamsurfaces are extracted. Considering this, and the nonintegrability of generic tensor fields (Section 3.4), Zhang et al.'s observation that they could construct streamsurfaces without visually obvious errors is quite remarkable, and could have deeper implications than they might have realized.</p><p>We believe that there is a close link between this early observation in the visualization literature and the sheet structure hypothesis, which has started to attract significant interest outside of visualization about a decade later <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>: It claims that fiber tracts cross in such a way that they form surfaces. We note that the original publication by Wedeen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> additionally called the crossings "near-orthogonal", which has been challenged in a technical comment by Catani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In their response, Wedeen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> emphasize the aspect of integrability, and the fact that it is independent from orthogonality. Due to the well-known limitations of the DT-MRI model, it cannot be used to conclude anything about crossing angles; our discussion will therefore focus entirely on the aspect of integrability.</p><p>In examples such as <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, we observed that, when seeding crossing fiber tractography <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> on streamsurfaces, the resulting streamlines <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. We observed that seeding crossing fiber tractography on DT-MRI streamsurfaces often results in streamlines that remain close to the surface, which is shown here in gray. This specific example shows part of the corona radiata. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>. A fixed streamsurface topology is assumed by the algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. The red vertex indicates the seed, blue arrows the order in which vertices are placed. Neighboring vertices might take very different integration paths, which leads to the artifacts illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>.</p><p>tend to remain close to the surface. We emphasize that the streamlines in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> are not derived from the diffusion tensor, and are not constrained to cross at any particular angle. The fact that they approximately form a surface locally supports the sheet structure hypothesis. The fact that this surface can be approximated as a DT-MRI streamsurface supports our own conjecture, which states that there are regions in the brain where DT-MRI streamsurfaces represent the sheet-like crossings postulated by Wedeen et al. This assumes a close alignment between the planes in which the two dominant fiber tracts cross (possibly non-orthogonally) and the planes spanned by the major and medium DT-MRI eigenvectors. In a recent paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, we provide quantitative evidence for such an alignment. We believe that, even though the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> leave room for further investigation, our conjecture is relevant to visualization because it suggests a potential anatomical interpretation of DT-MRI streamsurfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Patch-Based Rendering of Streamsurfaces</head><p>The most recent algorithm for streamsurface extraction is the one by Vilanova et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. It assumes a fixed topology (disk with holes), with a prespecified regular connectivity of potential vertices whose positions are found by integrating them in an order that forms a spiral starting at the seed, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> (a) shows a result from this algorithm, with a red sphere indicating the seed point. Nonintegrability of the involved eigenvector fields causes vertices that are connected by the prespecified topology to Since these effects accumulate over larger distances, they are not fully avoided by using nonintegrability |ζ | as a termination criterion (b). We therefore propose to render an automatically seeded set of small patches, which can either be made to overlap (c), or to leave gaps as a visual reminder that large-scale streamsurfaces are not well-defined mathematically, and their anatomical interpretation remains controversial (d).</p><p>end up far away from each other, which introduces spurious connections (marked in cyan). Moreover, cusps in the surface (marked with arrows) arise where the positions of adjacent vertices have been determined along different integration paths. Following C2, we modified this algorithm to use |ζ | ≥ 0.1 as an additional termination criterion. The results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> (b). As expected, the new termination criterion eliminated parts of the surface. Somewhat paradoxically, it also added new parts elsewhere, highlighted in (b) by coloring vertices orange if they are far away from the surface in (a). This is a side-effect of the spurious connections: Since the algorithm assumes that the respective vertices are close to each other, it does not attempt to grow the surface any further in these locations. Thus, the additional termination criterion may free up some of the available vertices to sample parts of the streamsurface that were previously not accessible to this algorithm. Cusps and some spurious connections remain in (b), which is unsurprising given the quickly accumulating effects of nonintegrability (I3). Therefore, it is necessary, but not sufficient to use a termination criterion based on |ζ |.</p><p>As a consequence of C1, which asserts the value of small streamsurface patches as a visualization technique, and C3, which casts doubt on the interpretability of larger streamsurfaces, we propose a novel, patch-based approach to streamsurface visualization, whose results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> (c) and (d). It is based on rendering a set of small (4 mm × 4 mm) streamsurface patches. They can be extracted with the modified algorithm from (b), which works well when constrained to sufficiently small surface patches in regions of sufficiently low |ζ |.</p><p>Since manually seeding a large number of patches would be tedious and unlikely to yield a visually informative overall arrangement, our method automatically places additional seeds for neighboring patches based on an original one, which can be specified by the user. This process uses the same grid-like integration that was described in detail in Section 3.1. From each original and new seed point, curves are extended in all four directions. Integration terminates when c p &lt; 0.2, |ζ | ≥ 0.1, or at the boundary of the domain. The endpoints of these curves are only added to the seed pool if they are sufficiently far away from all existing seeds, which guarantees that this procedure terminates even for complex overall surfaces, including ones that might loop back on themselves.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> (c), patch sizes are slightly larger than the maximum integration distance used for seed placement, which makes them overlap and, when rendered together, gives the visual impression of a single surface. In regions of stronger nonintegrability, or at high zoom levels, small gaps between the patches can still be seen. They help avoid the accumulation of visual artifacts that otherwise occur when trying to integrate a not fully integrable pair of vector fields over larger distances.</p><p>Compared to the traditional approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, our patch-based technique removes the spurious connections and the related inability to fully sample the surface. It also greatly reduces surface cusps related to nonintegrability. A remaining limitation is the fact that the global shape of the (apparent) surface is still not well-defined, since our automated seeding scheme is still affected by accumulating nonintegrability, so that changing the integration order could alter the placement of patches. As a visual reminder of the challenges in interpreting larger streamsurfaces, which are intrinsic to the problem and not specific to any particular algorithm (C3), one might deliberately leave gaps between the patches by making them slightly smaller, as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11 (d)</ref>.</p><p>In vector field visualization, Schulze et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> have formally defined surfaces that are globally "as perpendicular as possible" to a given vector field. This could also be applied to DT-MRI streamsurfaces, by optimizing surfaces so that they become as perpendicular as possible to the minor eigenvector field. This would reduce the visual effects of accumulating nonintegrability. However, as a tool that we hope will contribute to the ongoing scientific debate about whether or not fiber bundles form surface-like anatomical structures (Section 5.1), we prefer a visualization that is "visually honest" in the sense that it will not hide the effects of nonintegrability if it is present in the data.</p><p>Finally, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> (b) presents a particularly large patch-based streamsurface that our proposed algorithm has grown from a single seed point, and that we have not been able to reproduce using the traditional algorithm (a). It extends over the whole length of the left hemisphere, illustrating both the ability of our approach to visualize structures at this scale and the striking fact that the brain indeed contains such large and connected regions in which diffusion tensor eigenvectors remain locally near-integrable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>Streamsurfaces have been introduced early on to DT-MRI visualization, but are known and used less widely than streamlines or glyphs. Discovering a potential link to the recently proposed hypothesis that crossing fiber tracts in humans and nonhuman primate species form sheet-like structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> motivated us to revisit them as a visualization technique.</p><p>We focused on the issue of streamsurface integrability, which we studied with a suitable combination of mathematical reasoning, simulations, and an empirical investigation into an ensemble of real-world datasets, using both visual and statistical tools. This has led us to new conceptual insights and conclusions concerning the role of streamsurfaces in DT-MRI visualization (Section 5.1), as well as to a novel approach for streamsurface extraction (Section 5.2).</p><p>Our work proposes a measure ζ that quantifies the expected error up to which the major and medium eigenvector fields can locally be integrated into a surface. It can be used as a termination criterion in streamsurface integration, and it can be color coded to convey the local degree of nonintegrability. An important open issue concerns quantification of the accumulated uncertainty on streamsurfaces. For streamlines, there exists a wealth of techniques for probabilistic tractography, along with corresponding visualization methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Probabilistic construction of streamsurfaces is left as a challenge for future work.</p></div>

In the right column, the absolute value |ζ | of our nonintegrability measure is overlaid in black (transparent if |ζ | = 0, α = 0.5 for |ζ | ≥ 0.1). Even though |ζ | masks out several regions where we cannot expect to integrate meaningful streamsurfaces, substantial regions remain in which streamsurfaces can be used for visualization.</figDesc></figure>

Results with false discovery rate 5% are shown in red in (a). In one of the subjects, we performed tractography starting in the regions that are highlighted with light blue and yellow arrows.

Comparing nonintegrability |ζ | and diffusion tensor planarity c p with a bivariate color map reveals that most regions exhibit either high planarity (green) or nonintegrability (magenta). However, there clearly exist regions, shown in black, where the major and medium eigenvector fields are nonintegrable despite high c p . A joint histogram of both measures, computed over the full volume, confirms these observations.</figDesc></figure>
