<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Uncertainty visualization has been recognized as one of the top research challenges in the domain of scientific visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. Algorithmic and hardware limitations can modulate data in unexpected ways as data is processed through various phases of the visualization pipeline. The noise introduced in data due to limitations on data processing can significantly impact the final visualization. Brodlie et al. studied the sources of errors in the visualization pipeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and demonstrated that the quantification of uncertainty in visualization is important in avoiding misleading interpretations regarding underlying data. In other words, uncertainty quantification can potentially improve the reliability of decision support systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40]</ref>, especially for sensitive applications. We study uncertainty quantification in the context of level-set visualization.</p><p>Level-set visualization is one of the fundamental data visualization paradigms for interpreting scalar and vector field data in a broad spectrum of applications, such as medical imaging and flow visualizations for aerodynamics and hydrodynamics. The marching squares (MS) algorithm is a 2D version of the marching cubes algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> for level-set visualizations. The MS algorithm assumes a piecewise bilinear interpolation model, and the equation for the bilinear interpolant corresponds to the equation for hyperbolae. The robust implementation of the MS algorithm aims to reconstruct an isocontour that is topologically and geometrically consistent with the piecewise bilinear interpolation model.</p><p>For the MS algorithm, saddle points are the points where curves of hyperbolae intersect asymptotically. Hence, saddle points are considered as critical points in scalar and vector fields since they represent points where the topology for isocontours can either merge or split. The topological ambiguity in the MS algorithm, therefore, arises near saddle points since they can represent either a split or a merge configuration. A careful analysis is needed near the saddle points to avoid topological inconsistencies with the piecewise bilinear interpolation. The midpoint and asymptotic decider are well-known mathematical techniques for resolving topological ambiguities. The latter has been shown to be more accurate than the former <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The existing methods for topological ambiguity resolution assume that the sampled data values at the grid vertices are certain. However, in uncertain data, the ambiguity or uncertainty in topological configurations escalates. In our contribution, we address the issue of topological ambiguity resolution in the MS algorithm when sampled data is uncertain.</p><p>The uncertainty in data leads to uncertainty in the underlying bilinear interpolation function for each cell of a grid and, hence, their saddle points. We, therefore, define three terms relevant to the bilinear interpolation model for uncertain data. First, we define an uncertain cell as the cell with uncertain data at the cell vertices. Second, we define saddle points for an uncertain cell as a union of the saddle points of all possible bilinear interpolation functions for an uncertain cell. Lastly, we define saddle values for an uncertain cell as the data values attained at the saddle points for the same uncertain cell. In our contribution, we analytically derive variations in the saddle values for an uncertain 2D cell without needing to actually compute its saddle points.</p><p>The proposed derivations assume uniform and nonparametric noise for modeling data uncertainty at grid vertices. The nonparametric density models have been advocated for a more realistic characterization of noise distributions when compared to parametric density models <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Nonparametric models add flexibility to capture multimodal distributions. We initially assume a uniform noise model for deriving variations in saddle values of an uncertain cell. The density characterization for uniform noise assumption works as a building block for characterizing saddle value densities assuming nonparametric noise. Our results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref> show that the nonparametric noise assumption successfully captures multimodel probabilistic variations in saddle values for an uncertain 2D cell.</p><p>Athawale et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref> recently investigated positional uncertainty in level-set visualizations for uncertain scalar fields. Our work is primarily motivated by two major aspects of their contributions, specifically an analytic framework for fast and accurate characterization of the densities at the spatial positions of interest and a probabilistic decision framework for topological ambiguity resolution in uncertain data. In their work, the advantages of analytical models for level-set extraction in uncertain data over Monte Carlo simulations were demonstrated for nonparametric density estimation. Analytical models provide performance gain and higher computational accuracy. In our work, we devise an analytic solution that exploits the framework for the probabilistic midpoint decider <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> (also discussed in section 3) to resolve topological ambiguities for isocontours in uncertain 2D data.</p><p>Contributions: Our contribution in this paper is threefold. First, we derive the density, in closed form, that characterizes variations in saddle values for an uncertain 2D cell. The derivation assumes uniform and nonparametric densities for modeling data uncertainties at the cell vertices, and it uses the concept of ratio distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for analytic formulation. Second, we study the issue of topological ambiguity resolution in uncertain data by leveraging the framework for the probabilistic midpoint decider <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. We devise the probabilistic asymptotic decider for resolving topological ambiguities in noisy data. The probabilistic asymptotic decider leverages the computation of saddle value densities derived in our first contribution to efficiently decide topology in the marching squares (MS) algorithm. The proposed probabilistic framework allows us to quantify and visualize uncertainty in topological decisions. We encode topological uncertainty into visualization by employing a colormapping technique. Lastly, we confirm the higher accuracy and resilience of the statistical model for the proba-bilistic asymptotic decider with regard to existing decision frameworks through visualization. The existing frameworks include the asymptotic and midpoint deciders in the mean field and the probabilistic midpoint decider. The superiority of isocontour reconstruction for the probabilistic asymptotic decider is confirmed in the results shown in <ref type="figure">Figure  1</ref>.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we briefly discuss advances in the fields of topological analysis of level-set extraction and uncertainty visualization. In section 3, we summarize the asymptotic, midpoint, and probabilistic midpoint decider <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> frameworks for topological ambiguity resolution in the MS algorithm. Next, we mathematically present the research question of the characterization of uncertainty in saddle values for an uncertain 2D cell in section 4. The probabilistic asymptotic decider is derived in closed form in section 5 for the uniform and nonparametric noise models. Finally, we show the visualization results for the probabilistic asymptotic decider in section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>The state-of-the-art techniques in the field of uncertainty visualization have been reviewed by Bonneau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. We briefly discuss important contributions to uncertainty visualization relevant to the fields of level-set topology and statistical modeling. Two popular techniques for summarizing spatial variations in uncertain data are contour <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref> and surface boxplots <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Both methods derive quartiles of positional variations in level sets using the concept of functional data depth <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Pöthkow and Hege <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref> devised probabilistic marching cubes for the visualization of spatial uncertainty in isosurfaces when data noise is modeled using Gaussian distributions. The analysis of probabilistic marching cubes was further expanded to take into account nonparametric models <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The contour tree data structure proposed by Carr et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> is useful for gaining insight into topological events associated with isosurfaces. These events include appearance, disappearance, merging, or splitting of the geometric components of isosurfaces at critical points, such as local minimum/maximum or saddles, in a scalar field. Wu and Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> studied the effect of data uncertainty on contour trees and devised novel methods for integrating data uncertainty into contour trees. Agarwal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> developed probabilistic models for characterizing the variation in distance between the nodes of contour trees for uncertain data.</p><p>The visualization of distribution datasets is another important research challenge. In distribution datasets, each spatial data point is modeled as a distribution function. Kao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and Luo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> devised statistical shape descriptors for visualization of uncertainty in distribution datasets with the least possible clutter. The ProbVis system developed by Potter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> enables users to explore the probability and cumulative density functions interactively. Hazarika et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> characterized data uncertainty using copula-based mixed distribution models to study isosurface topology. The copula-based mixture models add the flexibility to characterize dependency between multiple random variables while allowing users to choose among a family of distributions for each random variable independently.</p><p>A considerable body of literature addresses the challenge of uncertainty quantification for visualizing vector field data and direct volume rendering. Otto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> studied uncertainty in streamline flows, as well as positional uncertainty in critical points for 2D and 3D flow fields assuming Gaussian noise models. Djurcilov et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> mapped the opacity in transfer functions to data uncertainty and colormapped scatter plot space by segmenting out regions of low and high spatial variations. Sakhaee and Entezari <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> and Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> modeled data uncertainty with parametric, nonparametric, and Gaussian mixture models and integrated uncertainty into the ray-casting technique for direct volume rendering. Colormapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, point-displacement <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, animation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and glyphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> are a few of the techniques to encode quantified uncertainty into visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">TOPOLOGICAL DECIDERS FOR THE MS ALGORITHM</head><p>In this section, we briefly describe the asymptotic, midpoint, and probabilistic midpoint decider frameworks for topological ambiguity reso-lution in the MS algorithm. Let (x, y) represent the cell domain, where x ∈ [0, 1] and y ∈ [0, 1]. Let d 00 , d 01 , d 10 , and d 11 denote the data values at the cell corners. For the bilinear interpolation model, the data values within a cell can be represented with the following hyperbolic equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">d xy = a 1 x + a 2 y + a 3 xy + a 4<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Let s represent the data values at the intersection of asymptotes (saddle points) of the equation of hyperbolae presented in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>, and let m represent data values at the midpoints of 2D cells. The values of s and m can be derived using the following two equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">s = d 01 • d 10 + d 00 • d 11 d 00 − d 01 − d 10 + d 11 (2) m = d 00 + d 11 + d 10 + d 01 4<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The asymptotic decider and the midpoint decider resolve ambiguous isocontour topology by investigating values of the variables s and m, respectively (section 17.4.1, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>) The probabilistic midpoint decider (section 3.3, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>) resolves topological ambiguities when sampled data is uncertain and data uncertainty is characterized by noise distributions. The uncertainty in data values at the position (x,y) is represented by a random variable D xy . Thus, the random variable corresponding to the midpoint of a 2D cell can be represented as M = D 0.5,0.5 . For the independent noise assumption, the density of M is computable in closed form through the convolution of densities at the cell vertices. The density of the random variable M can be leveraged to probabilistically decide the isocontour topology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</head><p>The noise in data values at the cell vertices introduces uncertainty in the values attained by the saddle points of the bilinear interpolant for (unknown) groundtruth data. We represent a random variable S to denote the variations in the saddle values for an uncertain 2D cell. A range of the values for the random variable S can be derived using the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S = D 01 • D 10 + D 00 • D 11 D 00 − D 01 − D 10 + D 11<label>(4)</label></formula><p>For the isovalue k, the topological ambiguity can be resolved by computing the most frequent sign attained by the saddle points for an uncertain cell. We presume that the saddle points for an uncertain cell are the proper positions for investigating data to decide topology because of the constant choice of the interpolation model (bilinear) for all realizations of uncertain data. Mathematically, we compute the probability that the saddle values for an uncertain 2D cell are less than k:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Pr(S &lt; k) = Pr( D 01 • D 10 + D 00 • D 11 D 00 − D 01 − D 10 + D 11 &lt; k)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>If Pr(S &lt; k) &gt; 0.5, the most probable sign for the saddle point of the groundtruth data is presumed to be negative and vice versa. We name this decision framework the probabilistic asymptotic decider. We rewrite Equation (5) in terms of two new random variables P and Q, where each random variable represents a combination of the sum and the product of the random variables D xy at the cell corners:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Pr(S &lt; k) = Pr(D 01 • D 10 + D 00 • D 11 &lt; k • (D 00 − D 01 − D 10 + D 11 )) = Pr(D 01 • D 10 + D 00 • D 11 − k • (D 00 − D 01 − D 10 + D 11 ) &lt; 0) = Pr(D 01 • D 10 + k • (D 01 + D 10 ) + D 00 • D 11 − k • (D 00 + D 11 ) &lt; 0) = Pr(S = P + Q &lt; 0), where P := D 01 • D 10 + k • (D 01 + D 10 ) Q := D 00 • D 11 − k • (D 00 + D 11 )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>In a similar manner, the decision framework for the probabilistic midpoint decider can be modeled by turning each quantity in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">3</ref>into a random variable:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Pr(M &lt; k) = Pr( D 01 + D 10 + D 00 + D 11 4 &lt; k) = Pr(M = D 01 + D 10 + D 00 + D 11 − 4k &lt; 0)<label>(7)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">SADDLE VALUE DENSITY FOR AN UNCERTAIN CELL</head><p>In this section, we present an analytic derivation for computing Pr(S &lt; k) = Pr(S = P+Q &lt; 0) (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">6</ref>). The topological decision of the probabilistic asymptotic decider depends upon the value of Pr(S &lt; k), as described in section 4. The steps for computing Pr(S &lt; k) are depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. The approach consists of three primary steps. First, we compute the probability densities pdf P (p) and pdf Q (q) for the independent random variables P and Q, respectively. The independent computation of pdf P (p) and pdf Q (q) is shown by the two columns of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> separated by a dotted vertical line. Second, the density of a random variable S is computed through convolution of the densities pdf P (p) and pdf Q (q) computed in step one since S = P + Q. Lastly, the density pdf S (s ) is integrated to evaluate Pr(S &lt; 0), which is equivalent to computing Pr(S &lt; k) (Equation (6)). Step 1: Computation of the densities pdf P (p) and pdf Q (q). Both densities are computed independently, as indicated by the two columns separated by a dotted vertical line. The dotted blocks denote the temporary renaming of variables.</p><p>Step 2: Computation of pdf S (s ).</p><p>Step 3: Computation of Pr(S = P + Q &lt; 0).</p><p>We provide a closed-form derivation of step 1, i.e, the computation pdf P (p) and pdf Q (q) in sections 5.1 (uniform noise) and 5.2 (nonparametric noise). We show only the derivation for the computation of pdf P (p) (the left column in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>) because pdf Q (q) (the right column in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>) is derived using a similar approach. A short description of steps 2 and 3 is provided in section 5.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Formulation of pdf P (p) Assuming Uniform Noise</head><p>Initially, we derive the cumulative density function of a random variable P, cdf P (p). The process is depicted in the left column of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. The pdf P (p) is obtained by taking the derivative of cdf P (p) with respect to variable p. The cumulative density function of a random variable P can be represented as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">cdf P (p) = Pr(P ≤ p) = Pr(D 01 • D 10 + k • (D 01 + D 10 ) ≤ p)<label>(8)</label></formula><p>For simplicity of discussion, we rename the variables D 01 and D 10 as X and Y , respectively. The temporary renaming of random variables is indicated by the dotted blocks in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. Equation (8) can be alternatively written as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">cdf P (p) = Pr(P ≤ p) = Pr(XY + k(X +Y ) ≤ p) = Pr(XY + kX + kY ≤ p) = Pr(XY + kY ≤ p − kX) = Pr(Y ≤ p − kX k + X ) = Pr(Y ≤ R), where R = p − kX k + X (9)</formula><p>Thus, the computation of Pr(Y ≤ R) is equivalent to computing cdf P (p).</p><p>We show the analytic formulation of Pr(Y ≤ R) when random variables X and Y are uniformly distributed. Let X ∼ U(a, b) and Y ∼ U(c, d).</p><p>For both uniform distributions, we assume a &lt; b and c &lt; d. We break down the formulation of Pr(Y ≤ R) into two steps. First, the distribution of a ratio random variable R = p−kX k+X , pdf R (r), is derived analytically. The second step uses pdf R (r) computed in the first step to evaluate Pr(Y ≤ R) in closed form. The computation of pdf R (r) is indicated on arrows in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> since it is fed as input for the computation of Pr(Y ≤ R).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Step 1: Formulation of pdf R (r)</head><p>We use the concept of ratio distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for the formulation of pdf R (r). Let R = R 1 R 2 , where R 1 = p − kX and R 2 = k + X. We break down the computation of pdf R (r) into three parts. First, we compute the joint density of R 1 and R 2 . In the second part, the cumulative density cdf R (r) is computed from the joint density computed in the part one. Last, pdf R (r) is computed by taking the derivative of cdf R (r) with respect to r. We initially describe an approach for computing the joint density of random variables R 1 and R 2 , as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. For axis R 1 , p − kb &lt; p − ka or p − ka &lt; p − kb depending upon the isovalue k. On the contrary, the order of the quantities k + a and k + b on the axis R 2 does not depend upon the isovalue k, and in all cases k + a &lt; k + b since a &lt; b. For now, let p − kb &lt; p − ka on the axis R 1 . The support of the joint density of random variables R 1 and R 2 is a line since both random variables depend only on X. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>, the tilted solid line segment between points end 1 and end 2 denotes the support of the joint density of R 1 and R 2 . Throughout this paper, end 1 and end 2 indicate the positions (k + a, p − ka) and (k + b, p − kb), respectively. Also, note that the height of the joint density at all points between end 1 and end 2 is constant since X assumes a uniform distribution.</p><p>Next, we derive cdf R (r). The cumulative density can be computed by sweeping the dotted line </p><formula xml:id="formula_8">R 1 R 2 ≤ r.</formula><p>Thus, cdf R (r) can be computed by finding the length of the line segment (I, end 2 ) and dividing it by the total length of a line segment (end 1 , end 2 ).</p><p>Lastly, pdf R (r) is obtained by taking the derivative of cdf R (r) with respect to r. For uniformly distributed random variable X, the probability density of a random variable R = p−kX k+X , in closed form, is given by: The approach presented for computation of pdf R (r) is applicable when the support of the joint density of R 1 and R 2 lies in any of the four quadrants or spans multiple quadrants. For the quadrants other than the first quadrant, the distribution function pdf R (r) stays the same; however, the domain of pdf R (r) can be finite and continuous or infinite and discontinuous. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> illustrates the two cases. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5a</ref>, the support of the joint density of R 1 and R 2 spans the second and the third quadrants.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Step 2: Formulation of Pr(Y ≤ R)</head><p>In this section, we derive Pr(Y ≤ R) in closed form using pdf R (r) formulated in step 1. Pr(Y ≤ R) is equivalent to computing the cumulative distribution function of a random variable P = kX + kY + XY (Equation <ref type="formula">9</ref>and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> (left column)). We present the derivation of Pr(Y ≤ R) for two cases, specifically when the domain of pdf R (r) is either finite or infinite, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>. To compute Pr(Y &lt; R), we again find the joint density of random variables Y and R. <ref type="figure">Figure 6a</ref> illustrates the joint density of random variables Y and R when R is finite and continuous, and <ref type="figure">Figure 6b</ref> illustrates the joint density when R is infinite and discontinuous. The joint density is a product of distributions pdf Y (y) and pdf R (r) since random variables Y and R are independent. The support of the joint density is a rectangle. The rectangle is bounded by the range <ref type="bibr">[c, d]</ref> along the Y axis, and the range [ p−kb k+b , p−ka k+a ] along the R axis.

First, we find the positions where Y ≤ R. Second, we integrate the joint density of Y and R at positions where Y ≤ R. The blue region highlighted in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> represents the half space generated by line Y R = 1 and indicates positions where Y ≤ R at any position R = r 1 . For example, the position R = r 1 is indicated by a purple line in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, and every point on the purple line has Y ≤ r 1 . The domain of integration to compute Pr(Y ≤ R) is the intersection of the blue region and the support of the joint distribution of Y and R.

In the second experiment, we demonstrate the higher decision accuracy and stability of the probabilistic asymptotic decider in uncertain data for deciding the contour topology when compared to the other decision frameworks. We support our claim of the higher reliability of the probabilistic asymptotic decider in uncertain data by presenting the results for the synthetic datasets in <ref type="figure">Figures 1, 9</ref>, 10, and 11.

The density pdf M (m ) is computed by convolving the densities of random variables D 00 , D 01 , D 10 , and D 11 . For the isovalue k = 4.5, the most probable sign for the saddle point of the underlying bilinear interpolant is negative since Pr(S &lt; 0) = 0.5187 &gt; 0.5. In the case of the probabilistic midpoint decider, the most probable sign is positive since Pr(M &lt; 0) = 0.3553 &lt; 0.5. We also studied topological decisions for the asymptotic and midpoint deciders in the mean of uncertain data. However, the decisions for the asymptotic and the midpoint deciders in the mean field are the same when compared with the probabilistic asymptotic and the probabilistic midpoint deciders, respectively, for the uniform noise assumption. The advantage of the probabilistic asymptotic decider is evident when data noise is modeled with nonparametric densities.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref>, the bottom row shows the results for the nonparametric noise models. We describe the process for drawing noise samples to show the advantage of nonparametric distributions over uniform noise models. We draw noise samples close to a user's choice of the groundtruth value in addition to a few outlier samples. For example, if a user selects the groundtruth value to be 1.5, then the sample array for this experiment looks like [1.4, 1.2, 1.3, 2.9]. Sample 2.9 is an outlier in this example. For the results shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref> .9], respectively. The isovalue is k = 4.2. Our results show that the outliers can significantly affect the mean of uncertain data, and hence, can result in misleading interpretations. In contrast, the nonparametric densities show higher resilience to the outliers. The bandwidth estimation for nonparametric densities is performed using Silverman's rule of thumb for the uniform kernel, as described in the last paragraph of section 5.2.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figures 8b.I and 8b</ref>.II, the shapes of the densities for the Monte Carlo simulations and the analytic formulation are the same for pdf P (p) and pdf Q (q), which proves the correctness of the derivation described in section 5.2. The nonparametric densities successfully capture the multimodel behavior of probabilistic variations in the saddle values for an uncertain cell. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8b</ref>.III illustrates the inconsistency in topological decisions for the probabilistic asymptotic and the probabilistic midpoint deciders. The probability of a negative sign for the saddle point of the underlying bilinear interpolant is significantly different when compared with the midpoint. Specifically, the probability of the underlying saddle point being negative is 0.9175, and it is 0.3928 at the midpoint for the isovalue k = 4.2. In <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, we test the effect of the bandwidth estimation on the saddle value probabilities for the data used in obtaining the results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8b</ref>. A nonoptimal choice of bandwidth can result in undersmoothing or oversmooting of kernel density estimates. Since decision probabilities depend upon the evaluation of the integral Pr(S &lt; 0), the shape variations in distribution of S caused by the bandwidth variations do not severely affect the integral computation. For example, for the variation of 0.1 in bandwidth b computed using Silverman's rule of thumb, the estimation of the saddle probabilities varied by approximately 0.02, as depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. Thus, the decisions of the probabilistic deciders are stable to the choice of the bandwidth for nonparamtric density estimation.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 10</ref>, we study the inconsistency in topological decisions for various decision frameworks as a function of isovalue k. We perform the study on noise samples consisting of outliers, similar to the ones used for obtaining the nonparametric density results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8b</ref>. The left and right columns in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 10</ref> resolve topological ambiguities The middle row shows the variation in the decider sign for uncertain data computed using the probabilistic asymptotic decider (section 5) and the probabilistic midpoint decider (section 3). The vertex signs reported by the probabilistic asymptotic decider match closely with the decisions for the gold standard, which illustrates the robustness of the probabilistic asymptotic decider to noise or the outlier samples. Moreover, the decisions of the probabilistic asymptotic decider can be computed fast because of the proposed analytical derivation. The vertex signs reported by the probabilistic midpoint decider are in disagreement with the gold standard in the isovalue range k = [3.9, 4.25]. The pink plots represent confidence information regarding the decisions made by the probabilistic deciders. Due to the uncertainty in the data, the confidence value for the probabilistic asymptotic decider is the lowest near k = 3.85 where the saddle point sign is flipped in the gold standard. However, the confidence for the probabilistic midpoint decider is the lowest near k = 4.25. The shift in k is because of the outlier samples. The bottom row in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 10</ref> plots decisions of the asymptotic decider and the midpoint decider for the mean of the uncertain data. The results again show the inconsistency in decisions with respect to the gold standard in the approximate isovalue range k = [3.9, 4.2]. The inconsistencies in the results for the mean field are again due to a significant shift in the mean caused by the outlier samples. Also, the mean field technique does not provide any confidence information regarding the vertex signs.</p></div>

We use the Blobs image shipped with MATLAB as the groundtruth data. For the isovalue k = 0.49, the image has 145 2D cells with ambiguous cell configurations. <ref type="figure">Figure   1a</ref> visualizes isocontours corresponding to two concentric circles in a portion of the groundtruth image. The white areas represent the cells with ambiguous topology for k = 0.49 in the MS algorithm, whereas gray denotes cells without any topological ambiguity. To compare the visualization performance of various decision frameworks, we inject the groundtruth image with noise to create an ensemble representing uncertain data. The noise samples are generated by following the same process as for the nonparametric density results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8b</ref>. We visualize the results of the comparison of various decision frameworks in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. In the first step for extracting isocontours from uncertain data, the most probable vertex sign is determined at each cell vertex. We follow the vertex-based classification approach (section 3.1, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>) for closedform computation of the most probable signs for grid vertices. The most probable vertex signs for the scalar grid decide whether the cell topology is ambiguous or not. Note that the computation of the cell configuration (ambiguous or not ambiguous) stays the same for all decision frameworks in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> since all frameworks are tested on the same ensemble data. The difference in isocontour topology in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> for various decider frameworks is because of their statistical properties.</p><p>For each cell with an ambiguous configuration, we make the topological decisions using three statistical frameworks, specifically the asymptotic decider in the mean field <ref type="figure">(Figure 1b)</ref>, the probabilistic midpoint decider <ref type="figure">(Figure 1c)</ref>, and our probabilistic asymptotic decider <ref type="figure">(Figure 1d</ref>). In the results for the mean field, the isocontour breaks at many positions because of the incorrect topological decisions for ambiguous cells, where ambiguous cells are marked in white. Moreover, the mean field result does not give any cues regarding confidence in the topological decisions. The probabilistic midpoint decider <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> recovers isocontours for the concentric circles reasonably well when compared with the mean field result. Moreover, the probabilistic midpoint decider allows us to encode confidence in the topological decision into the visualization. In <ref type="figure">Figure 1c</ref>, the cells with relatively low confidence are colored in red, whereas the cells with relatively high confidence are colored in blue.</p><p>Although the reconstruction performance for the probabilistic midpoint decider is better than the mean field decider, the reconstructed isocontour contains a considerable number of holes. The isocontour holes are prominent, especially in the regions of low confidence (red cells). <ref type="figure">Figure 1d</ref> visualizes the result of the proposed probabilistic asymptotic decider. The isocontours for the concentric circles are recovered considerably well when compared with the other two decision frameworks. The isocontours for the probabilistic asymptotic decider are recovered at all groundtruth positions except for two places: one position on the southeast and one position on the west side of the concentric isocontours. Moreover, the closed-form formulation of the probabilistic asymptotic decider allows fast and accurate computation of the probabilities as opposed to expensive Monte-Carlo simulations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 11</ref> visualizes a comparison of the time complexity and the accuracy of the probabilistic deciders for the uncertain Blobs dataset. The results are taken by increasing the number of ensemble members from five to 40 at intervals of five.

The topological inconsistency or the topological error of the proposed probabilistic asymptotic decider is lower than the probabilistic midpoint decider throughout. However, the inconsistency in decisions converges as we get more samples from the underlying distribution or for higher numbers of ensemble members.</p><p>In the last experiment, we compare the results of the probabilistic deciders for the real datasets in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12a</ref> visualizes isocontour reconstruction in the temperature dataset.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>The asymptotic and the midpoint decider are standard techniques for resolving topological ambiguities in the marching squares (MS) algorithm. The issue of topological ambiguity escalates for uncertain data. None of the existing work, to the best of our knowledge, has rigorously analyzed topological ambiguity resolution in uncertain data. In our contribution, we address the issue of ambiguity resolution in uncertain data by proposing a closed-form statistical framework. We analytically derive the density of the data values at the saddle points of uncertain bilinear interpolation functions for the MS algorithm assuming uniform and nonparametric noise models. The density formulation allows us to decide topology probabilistically and efficiently when compared to expensive Monte Carlo simulations. Our experiments show that the probabilistic asymptotic decider framework is the most stable and accurate when compared with other decision frameworks in uncertain data. The probabilistic models allow us to quantify the confidence in topological decisions and integrate it into the visualization.</p><p>The methods proposed in this paper are the building blocks for studying the research question of topological ambiguity resolution in the case of 3D isosurfaces. The probabilistic asymptotic decider can be directly applied to resolve the face ambiguities for the marching cubes algorithm. However, topological ambiguity resolution in 3D is a complex problem, especially when a cell has more than one ambiguous face. Accurate resolution of topological ambiguities for uncertain data in 3D requires the study of the probabilistic variations in data at the points in the interior of a 3D cell, e.g., body saddle points <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. As the next step of our work, we plan to study the question of density characterization at the saddle points of uncertain trilinear interpolation functions.</p><p>In the future, we also plan to take into account data correlation and kernels other than the uniform kernel for deriving the closed-form probabilistic asymptotic decider. The higher order kernels pose the challenge of computing complex integrals. It would be interesting to investigate the research question of probabilistic placement of saddle points in uncertain cells. Finally, we would like to investigate the impact of variations in data at the saddle points of uncertain fields in visualization applications, such as contour trees and flow field topologies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>The steps for computing Pr(S &lt; k).</figDesc></figure>

The decision plots are a function of isovalue k. 1 and -1 indicate the positive and the negative decider signs, respectively. The left and the right columns depict the topology by considering the sign computed at the saddle point and the midpoint, respectively. The top row shows the sign decisions for the groundtruth data. The top left image is considered as the gold standard. The middle row shows the decider signs for the probabilistic deciders in uncertain data along with the confidence information. The confidence map is shown in pink. The bottom row depicts topological decisions for the mean of uncertain data. The probabilistic asymptotic decider (left image in the middle row) is the most consistent with the gold standard when compared to the other decision frameworks.based on the signs derived at the cell saddle points and the midpoints, respectively. The top row shows the variation in the decider sign for the groundtruth data as a function of isovalue k. The groundtruth data was chosen to be d 00 = 10.1, , d 01 = −1, d 10 = 1.2, and d 11 = 6.1. 200 equispaced k values were sampled from the range[3.5,4.7]. The data values at the saddle point and midpoint are computed for each k using Equations (2) and (3), respectively. The vertex sign at the saddle point in the groundtruth data is considered as the gold standard.</figDesc></figure>
