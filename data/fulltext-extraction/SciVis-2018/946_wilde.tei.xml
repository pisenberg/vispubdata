<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Recirculation is a phenomenon that influences many effects in 3D unsteady flows. A number of approaches study recirculation itself or other phenomena in the presence of recirculation. Recirculation has been treated in rather different communities, ranging from biology, chemistry and physics to flow visualization.</p><p>There seems to be a common intuitive understanding about what recirculation is: The term may refer to locations where moving particles return to their starting locations after a certain time. Alternatively, recirculation describes regions of particles that do not leave a certain region (but may move within this region). Recirculation can also describe areas where particles move "backwards" or "against the main flow direction", which requires a proper definition of what "backwards" means. For steady flows, recirculation is related to closed orbits. Surprisingly, there seems to be no unique common definition of the concept of recirculation -a property that recirculation shares, e.g., with the concept of a vortex. In this paper, we start with a rigorous definition of recirculation: We introduce recirculation surfaces as features in 3D unsteady flows. Then we study their properties and provide a stable numerical algorithm for their extraction. We consider particularly the special case of steady flows in which our approach provides a new extraction algorithm for isolated closed orbits. Finally, we demonstrate recirculation surfaces for a number of artificial and real flow examples.</p><p>The main contribution of this paper consists in the definition of recirculation surfaces and the construction of an algorithm for their extraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>The analysis and visualization of 3D flow data is an important and active area of research as shown, e.g., by recent contributions by Chern et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and Günther et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Both approaches provide insight into given data by recovering and visualizing different flow phenomena. In this paper, we consider another, different property of flows: recirculation.</p><p>Recirculation is an important phenomenon that has been studied in various application domains. This section provides a brief review of related work on recirculation as well as on algorithms that our approach is based upon.</p><p>Recirculation in Physics and Computational Fluid Mechanics. In physics and computational fluid mechanics, recirculation can be important for controlling the flow in certain manners. For instance, Gautier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> use a machine learning approach to reduce the recirculation zone of a backward-facing step flow, and Debien et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> apply genetic programming for a flow of the turbulent boundary layer downstream from a sharp edge ramp. A recent overview of turbulence control is given by Brunton and Noack <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Tadmor and Banaszuk <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> track a reference orbit in a combustor recirculation zone to control vortex motion. Chen et al. and Laramee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> identify recirculating flow behavior as a feature for describing combustion processes in an engine. Noack et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> optimize coarse-scale mixing in a recirculation zone with a simple vortex model by Suh <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Shadden et al. [29]</ref> analyze aortic blood flows for predictions stenosis using Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that separate regions of recirculation flow. Mittasch et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> introduce a method for influencing cytoplasmic streaming and identify intracellular flows that show recirculating behavior.</p><p>Recirculation in Flow Visualization. Recirculation and related phenomena have been studied in flow visualization. Peikert and Sadlo <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> study vortex rings in recirculating flows. Sanderson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> extract orbits for a magnetic field by exploiting a natural Poincaré section.</p><p>Isolated closed orbits for steady vector fields. For steady vector fields, recirculation is related to closed orbits. There exists a number of methods for finding closed orbits in 2D fields. <ref type="bibr">Wischgoll and Scheuermann [40]</ref> provide the first approach to the detection of closed stream lines in planar flows. Theisel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> compute closed orbits in 2D by intersecting 3D stream surfaces. Morse decomposition provides a combinatorial approach to vector field topology and is used to detect closed stream lines in a series of articles by Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</p><p>Existing 2D techniques make use of the fact that closed orbits have either a source or a sink behavior. Their extension to 3D is straightforward as long as the closed orbits show source or sink behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. In 3D, however, a closed orbit can also have a saddle behavior, i.e., almost all stream lines in the neighborhood of the closed orbit move away under both forward and backward integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. For such orbits, the known 2D techniques do not carry over. The only existing solution so far is by Kasten et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>: The intersections of the closed orbit with a plane are obtained by computing the intersection of finitetime Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> ridges in forward and backward integration.</p><p>Extraction of isolated critical points. 3D steady vector fields generally have isolated critical points. For a piecewise linear field, they can be computed analytically as a solution system of three linear equations. For piecewise trilinear vector fields, an analytic solution does not exist. Mann and Rockwood <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> use an octree-like approach. An approach specifically designed for electric fields defined by a set of point charges was presented by Max and Weinkauf <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Weinkauf <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> uses a recursive algorithm: the values at all vertices spanning a trilinear cell are examined, and if all values shared the same sign a critical point cannot occur in the cell, and the recursion stops. Otherwise the cell is subdivided, and each subcell is examined recursively until a certain threshold is reached, i.e., the location of the critical point is bounded within the smallest subcell. This algorithm typically generates multiple "candidates" for the same root, which is resolved by a local clustering.</p><p>Tracking critical points. There exist several methods for tracking critical points. Tricoche et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> consider piecewise linear 2D vector fields and compute and connect the critical points on the faces of a prism cell structure obtained by the tetrahedral grid. Garth et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> give an extension to 3D flows defined piecewise on a tetrahedral partition with linear interpolation in both space and time. An adaptation to quadrilinear vector fields, i.e., linear interpolation in each spatial dimension and time, is straightforward. In this case, the restriction to cell boundaries of 4D hypercubes gives 3D trilinear vector fields. Then the extraction of critical points on hypercube faces can proceed as described above.</p><p>An alternative class of algorithms for tracking critical points uses feature flow fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, i.e., they construct space-time vector fields with tangent curves corresponding to the searched paths of the critical points. Klein et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> use this approach to track critical points in scale space. Weinkauf et al. present an out-of-core version <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and a stabilized version <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> of feature flow fields.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">path line of v v(x,t) v(φ (x,t + τ),t + τ) x Fig. 2.</formula><p>Illustration of a recirculation surfaceȲ (or Y in 3D): Starting a path line from a surface point x returns to x after a finite integration time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DEFINITION OF RECIRCULATION SURFACES</head><p>Throughout this paper we use the following notation and conventions. We write small bold letters for points and vectors, in particular, 0 denotes the null vector. We write capital bold letters for matrices. The capital letter Y denotes implicitly defined recirculation surfaces.</p><p>Given is the 3D time-dependent vector field v(x,t) such that v ∈ C 1 is at least once continuously differentiable. The term path line refers to the trajectory of a massless particle that is advected under influence of v for a given start time t and time interval τ. A point (x,t, τ) on a path line has the vector v(x,t + τ) as (spatial) tangent. In contrast, stream lines are tangent to the underlying vector field v(x,t 0 ) for a fixed time t 0 = const. If the vector field v vanishes at an isolated point x 0 , i.e., v(x 0 ,t) = 0, then x 0 is called a critical point.</p><p>We use the concept of the flow map φ (x,t, τ), which yields the location of a massless particle released at (x,t) after integration over a period of time τ. Further, ∇φ = ∇ x φ denotes the spatial gradient of φ , and φ t = ∂ φ ∂t is its time derivative. In order to search for recirculation, we need to explore a 5D space (x,t, τ) T where x is the spatial location, t is the starting time and τ the time of a particle integration. The additional dimensions of points or vectors in this 5D space are indicated by double bars, e.g.,x = (x,t, τ) T orv ∈ R <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . Similarly, we distinguish between Y ⊂ R 3 andȲ ⊂ R 5 .</p><p>We define the recirculation surface implicitly as the set of all 5D points, for which the flow map gives the identity, i.e., the loci of particles that return to their starting point after a finite integration time.</p><p>Definition. A recirculation surface is defined as the 5D surfacē</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Y = (x,t, τ) T ∈ R 3 × R × R : φ (x,t, τ) − x τ = 0 ∧ τ = 0 .</formula><p>The projection Y ofȲ to the 3D space is given by <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> gives an illustration of a recirculation surface. Note that the dependence on the denominator τ is necessary to treat the case τ → 0 properly: Without the term 1 τ , any point in the 5D domain would be part of a recirculation "surface" for vanishing integration time τ → 0, which is clearly undesired. With the term included, there exists a welldefined limit surface for τ → 0 as will be explained in Section 3.2.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Y = x ∈ R 3 : (x,t, τ) T ∈Ȳ .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Properties</head><p>This and the following sections require some concepts like tangent space from differential geometry of manifolds (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>) as well as concepts from linear algebra (e.g., null space and its basis). Furthermore, we apply multivariate calculus and provide nontrivial derivations in the appendix.</p><p>We use the abbreviations</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">φ := φ (x,t, τ) , v 2 := v(φ ,t + τ) = ∇φ • v + φ t , G := ∇φ − I .</formula><p>Note that the definition of v 2 uses a property of the flow map that is proven in the appendix. Furthermore, the definition of symbols v 2 and G will be used literally as "abbreviations" to facilitate expressions and comparing coefficients/factors in expressions. We consider the vector function</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">d(x,t, τ) = φ − x τ<label>(1)</label></formula><p>whose zeros define the recirculation surface.</p><p>To study its properties, we consider its (spatial) directional derivative in direction r, which is obtained using elementary differentiation rules:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">dd dr = ∇d • r = ∇φ • r − r τ = G r τ .</formula><p>Furthermore, the partial derivatives of d w.r.t. times t and τ are</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">∂ d ∂t = φ t τ and ∂ d ∂ τ = v 2 − d τ .</formula><p>This allows us to assemble the 5D gradient ∇d as the matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">M := ∇d = 1 τ G φ t v 2 − d ∈ R 3×5 .</formula><p>The recirculation surfaceȲ is defined implicitly as a point set. We study the neighborhood of a pointx 0 ∈Ȳ by constructing the tangent space {x : M(x −x 0 ) = 0 }, which provides a local linear approximation toȲ . The null space of M provides a basis for this affine subspace of R 5 . We generally expect M to have full rank, i.e., rank(M) = 3.</p><p>Then the null space has dimension 5-3=2, andȲ is indeed locally a 2-manifold, which justifies the term recirculation surface. Local configurations where M has a smaller rank are structurally unstable: with a small perturbation, like adding some noise, all singular values will become nonzero and M is "regularized" to have full rank. Note that the dimension of the kernel can only grow with a rank deficit of M, in particular, the dimension cannot become less than 2. We remark that the QR-decomposition M T = QR provides an efficient way to compute an orthonormal basis of the null space of M: The first two columns of the orthogonal matrix Q span the null space and hence the tangent space ofȲ atx 0 . While this is more efficient than a singular value decomposition of M (or likewise a spectral decomposition of M T M), it assumes full rank whereas singular values (or eigenvalues) would reveal a rank deficit directly.</p><p>The norm of the vector function d gives a pseudo-distance to the recirculation surface. This can be used for the "projection" of points onto the surface using a minimization approach. The gradient of the squared distance can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">1 2 ∇||d|| 2 = 1 2 (∇d) T d + d T (∇d) = ∇d T d = M T d .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>This allows to move pointsz 0 ∈ R 5 that are close to the surface towards and onto the surface, in the simplest case by a gradient descent, or using a more sophisticated nonlinear solver to minimize, e.g., ||d(z)|| 2 + µ||z −z 0 || 2 , where the weighted term accounts for finding the surface point with the shortest (Euclidean) distance toz, i.e., get close to a projection. Standard solvers can make use of the gradient vector ∇||d|| 2 , and the "closed form" (2) can be used instead of a finite differences approximation. We note that the computation of ∇φ and hence d typically involves finite differences in 3D.</p></div>

Also, a numerical root finding may fail for small τ as the absolute difference φ (x,t, τ) − x becomes arbitrarily small.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Properties of the 3D surface Y</head><p>We have shown thatȲ is in general a closed implicit surface in 5D. However, its projection Y ⊂ R <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> is an open surface that is circumscribed by boundary curves. To show this, consider that if (x,t, τ) T ∈Ȳ , then also the point (x,t + τ, −τ) T ∈Ȳ : both points must be on the surface. This means that almost every point on Y corresponds to two original points onȲ . The points onȲ where both originals collapse in a single point build the boundary curves of Y . Since this occurs for τ = 0, the paths of critical points of v are the boundary curves of Y due to (4). In general, Y ∈ R 3 is locally manifold. However, the projection R 5 → R 3 may result in self-intersecting surfaces and possibly "degenerate" (locally) to a curve (please refer <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref> right).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">EXTRACTION OF RECIRCULATION SURFACES</head><p>In this section, we describe an algorithm for the extraction of recirculation surfaces. Using the properties ofȲ , there are several starting points for constructing such an algorithm.</p><p>One possible approach is using a brute force sampling and trying to move from random seed points in 5D ontoȲ using ||d|| 2 and its gradient (2). This works reasonably only for seeds that are close enough to the surface, the generation of seeds should be adapted, e.g., using some sort of importance sampling. The collected surface points can be triangulated or rendered as splats (similar to a particle based extraction of 3D ridge surfaces presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>).</p><p>A different approach would start from a seed pointx 0 ∈Ȳ and apply a surface growing algorithm that propagates a front over the surface by "moving" in the tangent space followed by a back-projection onto the surface. The propagating front would expand, e.g., a triangulation, and possibly split and merge.</p><p>Unfortunately, both approaches become numerically unstable especially for longer integration times because both rely on the flow map gradients: It is known that for increasing τ the gradient of the flow map tends to have an "extreme behavior" in a sense that its norm grows exponentially (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>).</p><p>For this reason, we introduce an extractor that requires only the flow map but not its gradient. The algorithm is based on a repeated search of isolated critical points in steady 3D vector fields, which is a standard problem with well-established and robust numerical solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Algorithm</head><p>The core algorithm aims at finding all intersections of Y with straight lines parallel to the coordinate axes. For instance, we search for the intersections of Y with the line { (x, y, z) T : x =x, y =ŷ } that is parallel to the z-axis for fixedx,ŷ. For this restriction, we extract isolated critical points of the 3D vector field dx ,ŷ (z,t, τ) := d(x,ŷ, z,t, τ). If we find a critical point dx ,ŷ (z 0 ,t 0 , τ 0 ) = 0, then Y intersects the line in (x,ŷ, z 0 ) T . <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> gives an illustration. In a similar way, intersections of Y with lines parallel to the xor the y-axis can be computed. We decompose the spatial domain using a uniform grid and apply this search along all grid lines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of the algorithm.</head><p>The extraction of Y from v proceeds in the following steps: (iii) Find the intersections of Y with all 3D grid lines in x-, y-, and z-directions.</p><p>(iv) Visualize the sampled surface Y .</p><p>This algorithm needs further explanation.</p><p>Step (i): A complete sampling of d in 5D is challenging, both in terms of computation time and memory requirements. The choice of the grid resolution should reflect a trade-off between accuracy and performance. A reasonable starting point for a suitable grid resolution is the original grid on which v is given. However, a denser sampling grid for d gives better results because d collects information over several grid cells of v. In order to save memory, we use an on-the-fly computation of d for step (iii) instead of a precomputation of d on the whole 5D grid.</p><p>Step (ii): This is a solved standard problem in flow visualization. We use an approach similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> for a piecewise quadri-linear vector field. We consider each 4D hypercube</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">[x i , x i+1 ] × [y j , y j+1 ] × [z k , z k+1 ] × [t ,t l+1 ]</formula><p>in which a quadri-linear interpolation of v is assumed. In order to search for the intersections with the paths of critical points, we search the isolated critical points in the 8 cubes that build the boundary cubes of the hypercube:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">[y j , y j+1 ] × [z k , z k+1 ] × [t ,t l+1 ] at x = x i [y j , y j+1 ] × [z k , z k+1 ] × [t ,t l+1 ] at x = x i+1 [x i , x i+1 ] × [z k , z k+1 ] × [t ,t l+1 ] at y = y j [x i , x i+1 ] × [z k , z k+1 ] × [t ,t l+1 ] at y = y j+1 [x i , x i+1 ] × [y j , y j+1 ] × [t ,t l+1 ] at z = z k [x i , x i+1 ] × [y j , y j+1 ] × [t ,t l+1 ] at z = z k+1 [x i , x i+1 ] × [y j , y j+1 ] × [z k , z k+1 ] at t = t [x i , x i+1 ] × [y j , y j+1 ] × [z k , z k+1 ] at t = t l+1</formula><p>We find the critical points of v in each subcube by the same algorithm as in step (iii). Then we connect the points by a simple heuristic preferring spatially close points to be connected.</p><p>Step (iii): We assume a multilinear interpolation in step (i). Then the restriction to grid lines x =x, y =ŷ yields dx ,ŷ (z,t, τ) ∈ R 3 as a piecewise trilinear vector field over a regular grid. Finding its isolated critical points is another solved standard problem in Flow Visualization. We use the approach described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> that was briefly explained in Section 2. Since Y is double folded in 3D, we can restrict the search to positive integration times τ.</p><p>We restrict the search space to grid lines that are parallel to coordinate axes. The algorithm would work similarly with a restriction to any line (1 − α) x 1 + α x 2 in 3D: the spacial coordinate (here z) of critical points is to be replaced by the parameter α.</p><p>Step (iv): The previous step generates point samples onȲ . We triangulate their projection to 3D space. The resulting triangle mesh is a piecewise linear approximation to Y , which can be rendered with an piecewise additional color coding of either t or τ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Surface reconstruction</head><p>Surface reconstruction from point samples is a nontrivial problem that is well-studied in Computer Graphics. However, there are no methods readily available for the triangulation ofȲ , a closed 2-manifold in 5D. Likewise, reconstruction algorithms for closed or open surfaces in 3D typically assume 2-manifolds, i.e., they cannot deal with selfintersections and degenerate situations that may occur for the projection Y ∈ R 3 . Also an assumption on either the sampling rate, e.g., in terms of Nyquist frequency, or equivalently the minimum local feature size is required for guaranteeing an accurate reconstruction. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee a sufficient sampling of neitherȲ nor Y . Ideally, we would like to work in the original sampling space and reconstruct by triangulation of the samples. However, we note that the projection to a 3D triangle mesh that approximates Y may locally degenerate due to topology changes, which e.g., may lead to overlapping triangles, and due to the unacceptable "distortion" from the projection.</p><p>We leave surface reconstruction ofȲ and Y with guarantees as an open problem, and do not claim any novel contribution. In our experiments we used the ball pivoting algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This standard surface reconstruction method served well for our purpose for two reasons: First, it can handle surfaces with boundaries. Second, it propagates a "front" on the surface, which allows for partial processing of surface patches defined by specific t and τ intervals. This is a simple way to deal with self-intersections (or likewise surface sheets that get very close to each other): they are avoided by generating the intersecting patches sequentially and combining them into a single surface. While this works fairly well in practice, there is of course no guarantee. Our results show that -as expected -the reconstruction suffers from local undersampling, e.g., in regions of high curvature. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 9</ref> shows an extreme example. We note that, ball pivoting may be a promising candidate for extension to 5D, however, it is unclear whether a denser sampling is required.</p><p>The algorithm as is does not provide an adaptive sampling. While possible in principle, a true adaptation is nontrivial as it must adapt to the differential geometry of a 2-manifold embedded in 5D. Nevertheless, a naïve dense sampling of the search space is too expensive, which makes the use of a multiresolution approach mandatory. We apply a simple modification to the algorithm that introduces two fixed sampling resolutions: An initial, coarser sampling grid is used to detect the presence of recirculation. Whenever a candidate sample is found on an edge of this grid, we sample a local region at finer resolution.</p><p>In our experiments the size of the local region is twice the cell size in every dimension, and the sampling rate is quintupled in space and doubled in time dimensions.</p></div>

The next step searches for the intersections of a closed stream line with the plane. (ii) Search for the isolated critical points in the 3D vector field dx(y, z, τ) = d(x,ŷ, z, τ). If (y 0 , z 0 , τ 0 ) T is such a point, the point (x, y 0 , z 0 ) T lies on the closed stream line of v. Note that in this case, the closed stream line has at least two intersections with the plane.</p><p>(iii) Integrate v from (x 0 , y 0 , z 0 ) T to get the complete closed stream line. -Repeat steps (i) and (ii) to find more seeds on the closed streamline if the integration time is too large for a "stable" integration.</p><p>In the first step, one has to make sure that the considered "search" planes are setup densely enough to intersect all closed orbits. This plane selection problem is shared with other algorithms for 3D closed orbit extraction that are based on FTLE <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> or the Poincaré map <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. We do not provide a new contribution in this part of the algorithm.</p><p>We sample dx(y, z, τ) on a regular hexahedral grid and apply a piecewise linear interpolation, such that the search for critical points is a standard problem (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>). The problem of multiple intersections of a closed orbit with the plane is also shared with existing approaches. Also this part does not provide a new contribution.</p><p>We apply our algorithm to a simple CLOSED ORBIT test data set</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">v(x) =   1−r r x − 1 2 y 1−r r y + 1 2 x z  <label>(5)</label></formula><p>with r = x 2 + y 2 . This test data has an isolated closed orbit with a saddle behavior: the unit circle in the (x, y)-plane. An extraction approach based on the Poincaré map fails because the Poincaré map on a plane does not converge to its invariants depicting the closed orbit. Also the FTLE-based approach by Kasten et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> fails in this simple example because for a positive integration time τ, FTLE of (5) gives a constant value due to the linear third component. This means that it does not build the ridge structures that are required in the algorithm by Kasten et al.</p><p>Our algorithm extracts the closed orbit, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 4</ref>. This result is a new contribution: to the best of our knowledge, no existing algorithm is able to handle this simple example. Our algorithm handles cases that so far cannot be handled otherwise.</p><p>In Section 6 we present isolated closed orbits with a saddle characteristic in a real data set: a time slice of a blood flow simulation in a cerebral aneurysm <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 8</ref>). This is -to the best of our knowledge -the first saddle closed orbit on real data shown in the Visualization community, which comes as a side-product of our general approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>We show results for one synthetic data set and three simulated flows. All figures use the same color ramp for visualizing t and τ (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 5</ref>, left), the particular mapping depends on the extrema. All curves are rendered with integration time τ mapped to a constant color, boundary curves are depicted in blue color (only in figure 5, right and bottom left). Points are rendered as spheres, the color of starting points of recirculating path lines encode the start time t. For the sampling we give the resolution of the initial sampling grid (see Section 4.2) that is locally refined. Our algorithm was run in parallel on a virtual machine, that could access 18 Intel Xeon E5-2690v3 CPUs at 2.6GHz with 128GB RAM.</p><p>The 3D DOUBLE GYRE is a synthetic data set, which was introduced by Shadden et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.

We can also see the paths of critical points of v (blue curves) as boundaries of the recirculation surfaces, see step (ii) in the algorithm.</p><p>The search space was restricted to (x,t, τ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. The size of the initial sampling grid was 200 × 100 × 100 × 50 × 50, and 22 667 candidates were found (254 minutes). Local refinement (plus 92 minutes) generated a total of 445 062 samples. Nearly 90% of the computation time was spent on path line integration.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">T ∈ [0, 2] × [0, 1] × [0, 1] × [0, 10] × [0,</formula><p>The ANEURYSM data set is a 3D unsteady blood flow simulation in a geometric model of a cerebral blood vessel containing a strongly developed aneurysm. The research question behind the simulation is rupture prediction. Rupture of an aneurysm is associated with a high mortality rate; depending on the rupture prediction decisions about possible surgeries are to be made. Rupture prediction of cerebral aneurysms is still largely unsolved <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. However, it is known that rupture risk is related to the question whether the flow in the aneurysm is "cut-off" and disconnected from the main flow in the vessel. The (un-)connectedness of the flows in aneurysm and mail vessel is related to recirculation. If the main flow mainly passes through the aneurysm, few or no areas of recirculation are within the aneurysm.</p><p>Our approach finds a number of recirculation surfaces that cover large areas within the aneurysm. On the other hand, there are also large areas without recirculation surfaces, indicating that the main flow and the aneurysm flow are partly connected. While this does certainly not solve the rupture prediction problem, the systematic study of recir-culation in many aneurysm data sets may reveal correlations between presence, shape and size of recirculation surfaces and likely rupture events. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref> shows results: Few random path lines illustrate the flow, which enters the domain from the left side and leaves to the right. A collection of recirculating path lines indicate the presence of recirculation. The spheres indicate the start positions on the recirculation surfaces with color encoding start time t. The colors of the curves encode the integration time τ. The same color codes are used for the generated recirculation surfaces. Part of the occluding surface has been removed in the bottom right image to clear the view on the recirculation surface in the center of the domain.</p><p>In addition, we examined a single time slice of the ANEURYSM data and searched for isolated closed stream lines in the steady flow. We found two close stream lines, both with saddle behavior! <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref> shows the stream lines together with a visualization of the Poincaré maps. For this visualization, planes through the red and blue points orthogonal to the velocity direction are considered. In each plane, a small closed seed curve -a circle -is constructed, see the left column of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref>  The CAVITY data set is a vector field describing the flow over a 2D cavity. This data set was kindly provided by M. and E. Caraballo <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and B. Noack and I. Pelivan. 1 000 time steps were simulated using the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The flow exhibits a non-zero divergence inside the cavity, while outside the cavity the flow tends to have a quasi-divergence-free behavior. The data is almost (but not perfect) periodic, with a period of about 100 time steps in length, and only the first 100 time steps are shown.</p><p>Cavity flows (i.e., laminar flows passing over an open cavity) are of interest in many applications in engineering, ranging from the small cavities due to gaps in the body work of vehicles, the shapes of river channel beds, via cargo bays on aircraft, to the large scale flows in urban street canyons.</p><p>The main analysis question for the data set is: Do particles in the cavity always move out after a while, and if so, what is the maximal dwell time in the cavity? Clearly, this question is strongly related to  recirculation within the cavity. As the this is a 2D time-dependent flow, recirculation surfaces are defined in x-y-t-τ-space. We found a rather dense set of recirculation surfaces with rather long τ values inside the cavity, which indicate a high number of particles that remain in the cavity for a longer period of time. Further, we found more recirculation surfaces downstream outside the cavity, which indicate the impact of the cavity even in a certain distance. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows results: random collections of path lines, recirculating path lines same style as the previous figures.

In the following we discuss the value of recirculation surfaces for flow visualization and discuss their algorithmic reconstruction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relation to other Flow Visualization techniques</head><p>There is a variety of visualization techniques that locally focus on the velocity field. In recent years, integration based techniques moved into the focus of research, i.e., techniques that apply a visual analysis of the flow map. We claim that our technique is the first comprehensive feature extraction approach incorporating the complete flow map. Analyzing the flow map bears three challenges:</p><p>• It is a high-dimensional (5D) continuous field.</p><p>• It is expensive to compute.</p><p>• It contains large gradients, which accounts for extremely dense sampling, especially in the interesting areas where flow separation occurs.</p><p>In addition, our technique opts for a strong abstraction: We search for a steady 3D surface representing the relevant information of a complete 5D field. Domain experts would like to see a "still image" -that can be physically printed as a figure in an article -that tells as much as possibly of the story of a 3D unsteady flow. While there exists a number of solutions for steady flows (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and the references therein), we are not aware of any similar approaches for unsteady flows. In this sense this work could be considered as the first one in this direction.</p><p>Because of the high computational complexity, existing methods for flow map analysis focus on subsets of φ . For instance, the well-known FTLE visualization techniques usually pick a particular t and τ to either volume render or do feature extraction on the resulting 3D scalar field. Further, different t or different τ can be shown via animations. We are not aware of any approach to systematically computing and visualizing FTLE fields for all t and all τ values. We are neither aware of any other technique that systematically explore the whole 5D flow map.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Degeneration of recirculation surfaces</head><p>Recircualtion surfaces can degenerate to points, lines and volumes, but these cases are structurally unstable: adding noise to the data will break the points/lines/volumes to a finite number of surfaces. An exception is the case of steady flows where -as shown in Section 5 -recirculation surfaces degenerate to structurally stable isolated closed stream lines.</p><p>In order to illustrate the idea of structural stability, consider algorithms for isosurface extraction in 3D scalar fields. Such isosurfaces can collapse to a single point (for instance the scalar field s(x) = x T x = 0 in the origin) or to a volume (for instance s(x) ≡ 0). These cases are usually excluded from an isosurface extraction algorithm because of their structural instability. We do the same for recirculation surfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recirculation as a phenomenon</head><p>We are not sure if recirculation surfaces are the best approach to treat recirculation as a phenomenon. Neither exists a common definition of recirculation, nor are there ground truth data or other approaches to compare with. Thus, a final answer can only be given in the future by test of time.</p><p>However, there are points that give some evidence on the usefulness of our approach:</p><p>User feedback. -We presented the approach to domain experts that are involved in numerical flow simulation. They acknowledged the usefulness and found the detected structures interesting and informative. However, we consider this positive feedback as anecdotic. A formal user study was neither done, nor are we aware of a proper approach to the verification -or falsification -of recirculation surfaces by a user study.</p><p>Mixture of expected and surprising results. -The found recirculation surfaces mainly correspond with the expectation. For instance, for the SQUARE CYLINDER data we expected recirculation behind the cylinder, and our approach confirms this. On the other hand, there were surprising results: For the cavity data set, we found recirculation surfaces both inside the cavity and outside downstream the flow.</p><p>Closed orbits. -We interpret the fact that a special case of our algorithm solves the problem of extracting isolated closed orbits with saddle behavior as a point of evidence for the usefulness of recirculation surfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computation time</head><p>The computation time is long. The reason is in the nature of flow maps described above. We are not aware of any faster algorithm doing a systematic analysis of the whole flow map.</p><p>Further, our approach can be seen as preprocessing step: Recirculation surfaces are computed once and stored along with the flow data. Then recirculation surfaces can be explored by interactively seeding path lines on them and observing their behavior (see the accompanying video).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parameters</head><p>The presented algorithm comes with a number of parameters that can be divided into two classes: first, parameters of the existing standard algorithms that our algorithm is based upon, and second, new parameters inherent to the new algorithm.</p><p>The first group includes the choice of ODE solver and its parameters required for numerical path line integration. For instance, we use a fourth order Runge-Kutta solver with adaptive step size that is controlled, e.g., by error tolerance and maximum step size. Furthermore there is the initial grid resolution for finding isolated critical points and the maximum recursion depth to bound subdivision as well as a strategy for clustering multiply detected points. Finally, a heuristic is required for tracking critical points that decides when to locally connect extracted critical points at different time steps. We do not further discuss these parameters here because they are well-discussed in the original publications. Instead, we consider the algorithms as black-boxes for our approach.</p><p>The parameters of the second group reduce to the grid resolution for sampling d. Its variation does not show any surprising behavior: a The surface shows a high spatial curvature directly behind the cylinder. The sampling was not dense enough to capture the recirculation everywhere sufficiently. Therefore the reconstructed surface has jagged borders and some holes.</p><p>higher sampling rate increases accuracy and computation time. In theory, the sampling rate should not fall below the Nyquist frequency to capture the recirculation surfaces. It can be bounded by using assumptions on the local feature size or curvature of the surface. However, we see currently no way to determine the (local) sampling rate reliably. The situation is significantly more difficult as for surface reconstruction in 3D -which is a difficult problem already: A sampling and reconstruction must take into account curvature of a 2-manifold embedded in a 5D space. We know that this manifold has regions of high curvature. Moreover, the differential geometry in 5D does not carry over to the projection to 3D, the ultimate visualization space. For instance, the projection Y ∈ R 3 is in general a 2-manifold. However, configurations in the projection can lead to different topologies of the projected surface in 3D: First, points (x,t + τ, −τ) T ∈Ȳ build boundary curves of Y (see Section 3.3). Second, closed stream lines in steady flows v(x,t) = v(x) constitute a degenerate recirculation surface (see <ref type="bibr">Section 5)</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we chose the simplest approach and use regular sampling. The disadvantages of this approach are potential undersampling, i.e., loss of information, or oversampling, i.e., waste of computation time. Both are likely to occur at least locally: the grid provides no means of adaptation. This property, however, is shared with many very successful algorithms that restrict themselves to operating on uniform grids. The simplicity of this approach is at the same time its biggest advantage. In our setting, it allows for relying on fairly simple and proven standard methods and leads to an only moderately complex implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>Recirculation is an important phenomenon that is studied in many application domains. Recirculation can be explained and understood intuitively. Surprisingly there existed no formal definition so far. In section 3 we gave a formal definition as well as properties of recirculation surfaces and showed how to compute them in section 4. We search the surface in 5D by intersections with lines. This way we are able to project the problem to a 3D search for critical points in constant vector fields. The search for isolated closed stream lines is a special case of our approach, which was explained in section 5. In section 6 we showed results followed by a discussion.</p><p>Our approach provides points of the recirculation surface on the edges of a regular grid. On the one hand, this ensures a certain minimum density of samples points (within in the range covered by the grid), on the other hand it hinders a higher density of the samples, leading to artifacts in the point based rendering. We see two ways to deal with this: a modification of the algorithm to adaptive grids, or the reconstruction of a triangle mesh from sample points. For the latter option, surface extraction could be carried out by an algorithm similar to Marching Cubes. However, in addition to the standard Marching Cubes configurations, few more cases have to be considered: The 3D surface Y can have self-intersection and therefore it can have more than one intersection point with an edge of a cell. Moreover, in the presence of boundary curves, Y may enter a cell but does not necessarily leave it but end in the boundary curve instead.</p><p>Another current limitation is performance. The obvious solution for future research is adaptive sampling in 5D, which clearly has the potential to speed up the algorithm. On the other hand, no extreme improvement of the performance can be expected since our algorithm does an exhaustive feature extraction in an expensive 5D space.</p></div>

Further, consider a point (x 1 ,t 1 ) in a small linear neighborhood of (x 0 ,t 0 ): (x 1 ,t 1 ) = (x 0 ,t 0 ) + εr for a small ε. Then the definition of the flow map gradient gives 1 ε φ (x 1 ,t 1 , τ) −φ (x 0 ,t 0 , τ) = ∇φ (x 0 ,t 0 , τ)r. If we place (x 1 ,t 1 ) on the path line through (x 0 ,t 0 ), i.e.,r =p(x 0 ,t 0 ), it remains on the same path line during integration.
