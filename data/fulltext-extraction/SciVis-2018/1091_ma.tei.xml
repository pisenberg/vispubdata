<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) uses computational models to predict future weather states based on current atmospheric measurements. However, the dynamical systems used to model the atmosphere behave chaotically, in that small changes in initial conditions can result in different predictions. Furthermore, the effects of dynamic physical processes of the atmosphere that NWP simulates is model dependent, making weather forecasts vary from model to model. Since the 1990s, ensemble forecasting as a tool has been routinely used to analyze the uncertainty and gauge the confidence in weather forecasts. Each ensemble member is a possible forecast conducted with perturbed initial conditions, different NWP models, different spatial resolutions, or different vertical coordinate systems. Due to the large size and high complexity of ensemble data, visualization plays a central role in assessing the inherent variability and uncertainty in modern weather forecast systems.</p><p>A popular technique for uncertainty visualization of ensemble data is the so-called spaghetti plot, a contour plot of a particular data field, where isocontours of all ensemble members are rendered simultaneously. It is the only conventional visualization technique to directly examine the distribution behavior of all ensemble members in meteorology <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Obviously, plotting isocontours of a dense set of isovalues for all ensemble members causes significant overdrawing (visual clutter), making the spaghetti plot challenging to parse. In practice, only isocontours for one or a few selected isovalues are plotted to reduce this visual clutter. By examining the positional variations of the isocontours, forecasters analyze the distribution of ensemble members in regions near the isocontours for the presence of clusters, main trends, and outliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. However, due to the complicated shapes of isocontours and increasing size of ensemble members, spaghetti plots for even a single isovalue can be difficult to interpret.</p><p>Recently, there has been a growing body of research in the visualization community on visual analysis and uncertainty quantification in ensemble data <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>. In particular, improving the state-of-the-art of the spaghetti plot has attracted considerable attention. Whitaker et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> generalized the concept of statistical data depth to ensemble isocontours to produce a global center-outward ordering. The contour box plot is proposed to visualize statistical quantities of the ordered isocontours, where the mean isocontour, the median isocontour, the 50% confidence band, the 100% confidence band, and the outliers are displayed. Ferstl et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref> performed clustering analysis on ensemble isocontours and proposed a contour variability plot which aggregates a large number of isocontours into cluster bands. These methods reduce the visual clutter of spaghetti plots by abstracting isocontours into confidence bands which present an overview of the distribution of the isocontours. However, the direct examination of isocontours is no longer possible, and the effectiveness of the produced visual analysis tools is limited to the generation and visualization of static summary plots. For more details, please refer to our supplemental document. Alternatively, Quinan and Meyer <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> enabled interactive highlighting in spaghetti plots which allows the comparison of isocontours across multiple isovalues. However, the per-isovalue interactive highlighting does not allow discerning isocontours with the same isovalue. Sanyal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> integrated uncertainty glyphs in spaghetti plots for exploration of weather forecasting ensembles.</p><p>In this paper, we present an interactive framework for uncertainty visualization of ensemble isocontours. Our framework enables a complete exploration of ensemble isocontours, including isovalue selection, interactive isocontour variability exploration, and interactive sub-region selection and re-analysis. We propose a novel visual analysis tool, the mode plot, that visually encodes the structure obtained by the highdensity clustering paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and the distribution behavior of the given ensemble isocontours. Unlike previous approaches that aggregate isocontours into static summaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> or directly add additional visual encodings in spaghetti plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, we link the mode plot to the spaghetti plot and use interactive highlighting to select subsets of isocontours. The mode plot serves as a scaffold for interactive exploration of spatially coherent subsets of isocontours, while the chosen isocontours are directly highlighted and examined in the spaghetti plot. The linked mode and spaghetti plots provide a focus+context visualization for analyzing the variabilities of ensemble isocontours for a given isovalue. To select informative isovalues from a set of all possible isovalues, we present a simplified spaghetti plot which provides an overview of the variability and distribution of ensemble isocontours across multiple isovalues. Since the ensemble isocontours may exhibit spatial variability in different geographical regions, a global clustering of ensemble isocontours may not be adequate for regional analysis. Our framework allows an interactive selection of interesting sub-regions for clustering re-analysis and uncertainty re-evaluation.</p><p>Our framework is based on the high-density clustering paradigm from a new and expanding branch of statistics -topological data analysis (TDA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. The high-density clustering also falls broadly in the class of hierarchical clustering. However, unlike most cases whose cluster hierarchies are generated based on various heuristics or computational convenience, the high-density clustering studies the mode hierarchy of the density estimate for a given dataset. It directly links the clustering task to the fundamental problem of non-parametric density estimation. We propose a bandwidth selection method which maximizes the number of significant modes of the density estimate. As a result, main trends and outliers of ensemble isocontours can efficiently be identified and separated by the high-density clustering. The proposed bandwidth selection method provides two intuitive tuning parameters, which also allow users to customize the clustering result. Our proposed mode plot visually encodes the structure of nested high-density clusters and provides a great deal of information that goes beyond the clustering task. In particular, it frees the user from having to assert prior knowledge on the right number of clusters, provides a useful summary of the entire ensembles, and allows the focus and selection of interesting subsets of isocontours at various granularities. Our implementation enables efficient clusterings and interactive explorations of ensemble isocontours.</p><p>The contributions of this paper include:</p><p>• High-density clustering for ensemble isocontours: We introduce and generalize the high-density clustering algorithm for studying the uncertainty and distribution behavior of ensemble isocontours. We propose a bandwidth selection method for estimating the density function of ensemble isocontours.</p><p>• Interactive exploration of ensemble isocontours: We present the mode plot to visually encode high-density clustering results and provide an effective summary of the distribution of ensemble isocontours. The mode plot serves as a scaffold for selection of subsets of isocontours, which are directly visualized in the linked spaghetti plot via interactive highlighting.</p><p>• Isovalue selection and sub-region re-analysis: We propose a simplified spaghetti plot that presents a highly interpretable overview of isocontour variabilities across multiple isovalues, from which one can select isovalues of interest. Our framework enables an interactive selection of sub-regions for clustering re-analysis which allows for assessing the local variability of ensemble isocontours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Uncertainty visualization has attracted considerable attention in the visualization community in the past two decades. For reviews and taxonomies of uncertainty visualization, we refer to some excellent surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. Ensemble visualization is a special category of uncertainty visualization, where uncertainty information is given by a set of possible outcomes of the data. Visualization of NWP ensembles is a workhorse application for ensemble visualization, and a recent survey on visualization in meteorology is given by Rautenhaus et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Obermaier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> classifies the ensemble visualization as localbased visualization or feature-based visualization. Location-based methods examine the statistical properties at fixed locations of the ensemble, while feature-based methods extract meaningful features (e.g., isocontours for scalar fields or pathlines for flow fields) from individual ensemble members and compare them across all ensembles. Our approach belongs to feature-based methods, and we review literature that is most relevant to our work. Many approaches have been proposed to incorporate statistical models into the process of isocontour (or isosurface) detection and extraction. Pöthkow et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> modeled the uncertain scalar data as random fields and introduced the level crossing probability to measure the spatial distribution of uncertain isocontours. The authors further extended this idea to consider the correlation between random variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and modeling of random fields with non-parametric models <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Pfaffelmoser et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> proposed an algorithm to efficiently compute the isosurface crossing probabilities through a correlated random variable field. Athawale and Entezari <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> presented a closed-form solution for the level crossing probabilities for data uncertainty quantified by the uniform distribution. They further proposed an isosurface extraction algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> for uncertain scalar fields.</p><p>Feature-based methods infer the uncertainty of the data field based on the variability and spatial distribution of extracted isocontours.</p><p>Whitaker et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> introduced the concept of statistical data depth and its generalization for measuring the location centeredness of ensemble isocontours. This enables a global center-outward ordering from which a number of isocontour-relevant statistical quantities are derived. These statistical quantities are further visually encoded in a new visualization called the contour boxplot which abstracts and summarizes the conventional spaghetti plot. Ferstl et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> employed principal component analysis (PCA) to transform ensemble isocontours to a Euclidean space based on a popular representation of the isocontour: the signed distance transform. Clusters in the transformed space are detected by fitting a multivariate normal distribution (or ellipse) to each cluster. A so-called contour variability plot is proposed which shows the median isocontour and the confidence band for each cluster. These methods aggregate and summarize isocontours in static confidence envelopes which obscure geometric information which is readily seen in spaghetti plots, e.g., the distances between ensemble isocontours within the confidence envelope. Recently, there has been significant interest in uncertainty visualization of isosurfaces of 3D ensemble data <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. In our work, we summarize the distribution of ensemble isocontours in the mode plot and interactively select subsets of interesting isocontours highlighted in the spaghetti plot.</p><p>Our work is also related to the interactive exploration of the uncertainty of ensemble data. Recently, a number of visualization systems have been proposed for interactive visual analysis of ensemble simulations, including Ensemble-Vis <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, Noodles <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, Met.3D <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, WeaVER <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, and Ovis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Demir et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed multi-charts to encode statistical information of 3D ensemble data, which are linked to the spatial view via volume rendering. Kehrer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> employed brushing and linking techniques for exploration of ensemble data based on statistical moments. Shu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> proposed an interactive visual analysis tool for studying the spatiotemporal similarities in time-varying ensembles. The brushing and linking technique connects multiple displays of the data and plays an essential role in the interactive visual analysis. In our framework, we link the mode plot to the spaghetti plot, where the selection of data in the mode plot is reflected in the spatial context via interactive highlighting.</p><p>Clustering, a fundamental approach to discover grouping patterns, plays an essential role in reducing the complexity of ensemble data. Thomas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> used the idea of clustering contours to detected symmetric regions in scalar fields. Ma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In particular, Kumpf et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> recognized that clustering results of meteorological ensembles can be sensitive to small changes in selected geographic regions. We use the proposed mode plot to efficiently encode the hierarchical high-density clustering result which provides a useful 2D summary of the distribution of ensemble isocontours. We approach the sensitivity of clustering to the selection of geographic regions via interactive sub-region selection and clustering re-analysis.</p></div>

We use a popular and powerful representation for isocontours (or isosurfaces) called the signed distance transform, which has been successfully used for solving various visualization problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Given an ensemble of n scalar fields s 1 , ..., s n ∈ R m (defined on the same grid structure, e.g., longitude-latitude grid, with m grid points) and an isovalue of interest, we compute the signed distance transforms d 1 , ..., d n ∈ R m for the corresponding isocontours. Each grid point of d i records its (signed) closest distance to the isocontour of s i , where the sign indicates the side of the isocontour on which the grid point is seated. Each d i (representing the isocontour of member i) can be treated as a point in an m-dimensional vector space <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, which directly enables the applications of various algorithms, including high-density clustering. There is a number of ways to compute the signed distance transform, and we discuss our implementation in Section 6. Note that the span of d 1 , ..., d n is a vector space whose dimension is bounded by the minimum of m and n (n &lt;&lt; m).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">High-density Clustering</head><p>Given a set of isocontours of an isovalue d 1 , . . . , d n ∈ R n−1 , the kernel density estimator (KDE) at an arbitrary point</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">d ∈ R n−1 iŝ f h (d) = 1 nh n−1 n ∑ i=1 K d − d i h = 1 n n ∑ i=1 K h (d − d i ) (1)</formula><p>where K is a smooth function called the kernel function, a nonnegative function that is symmetric around 0 and integrates to 1, e.g.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Gaussian kernel K(x) = 1 √ 2π e − x 2 2 2 .

Note thatf h is a non-parametric function because it depends on the data. For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2 (a)</ref> plots the density function estimated from a synthetic 1D point cloud. The point cloud, plotted in the bottom, is composed of 120 samples drawn from a Gaussian mixture of three normal distributions and 2 outliers. The KDE results in a multi-modal distribution which expresses its capability for estimating arbitrary shape distributions.</p><p>For any threshold value ε ≥ 0, the upper level set off is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">U ε = d|f (d) ≥ ε<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The high-density clusters at density level ε are the connected components of the upper level set U ε . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2 (a)</ref> demonstrates the high-density clusters for a particular ε (indicated as a horizontal dashed line), where the upper level set consists of two connected components (highlighted as red and blue). The data points that belong to the high-density clusters are also highlighted accordingly at the bottom. Note that these highdensity clusters generally do not partition the entire dataset, instead only data points belonging to the underlying U ε are considered in the clustering. As ε decreases, the region covered by U ε expands and the density requirement for being a "high-density cluster" is relaxed. As such, new connected components may be born, and existing clusters can merge into a single connected component. Considering the highdensity clusters for all ε, a complete clustering structure is captured by a hierarchy of nested subsets of the data. The evolution of high-density clusters and their order of inclusions is typically denoted as a dendrogram (or level set tree), as shown on the right of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2 (b)</ref>. Decreasing ε fromf max to 0, whenever we reach a mode (green dash lines), there is birth of a new connected component in U ε as well as a leaf branch in the dendrogram. On the other hand, the connections of modes (orange dashed lines) result in the merges of the connected components in U ε as well as the branches in the dendrogram. Each branch represents the high-density clusters with the same topology, i.e., they contain the same set of bumps (or modes). Each leaf branch corresponds to a single mode where the highdensity clusters have the simplest topology -a bump. The high-density clustering characterizes the mode hierarchy and the shape of the density estimatef .</p><p>High-density clustering has a direct connection to persistent homology in TDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Persistent homology is a new branch of statistics devoted to discovering the shape of the data based on its connectivity structures: connected components (0th dimensional topological features), cycles (1st dimensional topological features), or high dimensional voids. High-density clustering is a special case of persistent homology where the evolution of the connected components of the density estimate at multiple density levels are studied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Bandwidth Selection</head><p>The high-density clustering paradigm directly links the clustering task to the fundamental problem of non-parametric kernel density estimation. The sole parameter involved in the entire clustering process is the smoothing bandwidth h, which exhibits a strong influence on the result. From an exploratory point of view, all choices of bandwidths lead to useful density estimators <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, thus useful clusterings. While large bandwidths provide a picture of the global structure of the data, small bandwidths reveal local cluster structures. However, in our case, interactive bandwidth exploration brings in additional interactions, thus impeding the uncertainty exploration of ensemble isocontours. Therefore, we need to select a bandwidth that allows the identification and separation of main trends, as well as outliers, from the clustering result.</p><p>Commonly-used methods for bandwidth selection include the rule of thumb <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, least squares cross-validation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, or plug-in method <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Roughly speaking, all these methods are aimed at obtaining a density estimator that minimizes the L2 loss function (or the mean integrated squared error). These methods are not recommended in TDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>, because the accuracy of the density estimator (with respect to L2 risk) is not tightly coupled with the topology (or shape) of the data. One can estimate the density function poorly but can still obtain the correct evolutions of topological features (or mode structure of the distribution) of the data. Chazal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> suggests a bandwidth selection method that maximizes the number of statistically significant topological features, including connected components, circles, and high-dimensional features. In the case of high-density clustering, each mode defines a (0th dimensional) topological feature, i.e., a connected component. The "significance" of a local mode is determined by its persistence (i.e., merge time minus birth time) in high-density filtrations of U ε , as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2 (b)</ref>. Persistence confidence bands are constructed using bootstrapping, and a mode is treated as significant if it falls within the confidence bands. A subset of bandwidths is chosen from all possible bandwidths that maximize the number of significant features (and total significant persistence). However, this approach is also computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional data, and the computational overhead comes both from the evaluation of high-dimensional density estimator and the bootstrapping.</p><p>Our idea for bandwidth selection also involves maximizing the number of significant modes. Instead of the persistence, we propose to define the significance of a mode based on the size of its mode cluster. A mode cluster is defined as the basins of attraction of the mode, i.e., the sets of data points whose gradient ascents stop at the same mode. The size of a mode cluster is the number of ensemble members in the underlying cluster. Let c 1 (h), c 2 (h), . . . , c k (h) denote the sizes of the mode clusters at scale h (one can compute these quantities efficiently using the mean-shift algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>). Formally, we define the number of significant modes N(h) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">N(h) = # i|c i (h) ≥ σ sig (3)</formula><p>where σ sig is a threshold parameter that defines the smallest size of a mode cluster to be qualified as significant. N(h) is small when h is small since the data is under-smoothed, resulting in most c i (h)'s being smaller than σ sig . On the other hand, for a large h, N(h) is also small because the data is over-smoothed and produces very few modes. The optimization of N(h) balances the tradeoff between the number of modes and the size of the mode clusters. Since a slight increase/decrease of h may only slightly increase/decrease the sizes of the mode clusters but not change N(h), the optimal solution forms a set of similar bandwidths. To select a single bandwidth, we introduce another parameter, σ outlier , which specifies the upper bound of the number of outlier modes: O(h) = # i|c i (h) &lt; σ sig . From the optimal solution set, we choose an h that maximizes O(h) subject to O(h) ≤ σ outlier . A small σ outlier picks a relatively large smoothing bandwidth that merges outlier modes to significant modes, while a large σ outlier selects a small bandwidth to allow the separation of outliers. For the case of O(h) &gt; σ outlier for all candidate bandwidths, it is not possible to merge the required number of outlier modes to significant modes given the optimization of N(h), due to the high dissimilarity between the outliers and the main trends. In this case, we choose the largest h from the solution set to limit the number of outliers. The default settings for σ sig and σ outlier are 30% of the number of ensemble members and 2 respectively. However, users can conveniently change these parameters according to their own needs as demonstrated in Section 5. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref> illustrates the proposed bandwidth selection method for ensemble isocontours using the NCEP's SREF (Short-Range Ensemble Forecast) dataset. There are 26 members in this dataset, and we transform the ensemble isocontours to Euclidean space in R 25 . We did not manage exhaustive comparisons with existing methods due to their various computational overheads for our high dimensional data. For example, the popular R package 'ks' <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> provides rich bandwidth selection methods; however, it supports at most 6-dimensional data. Therefore, we compare our approach with the rule of thumb method. For each selected bandwidth, we examine its performance for mode clustering using the mean-shift algorithm. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref> shows the results of mode clustering with different bandwidths, where isocontours of different mode clusters are uniquely colored. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3 (a)</ref> shows that the rule of thumb method selected a very small bandwidth that significantly <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. The spaghetti plot for the synthetic data. The synthetic ensemble contains four trends and two outliers.</p><p>under-smoothed our high-dimensional data, resulting in a small local mode for each isocontour. We suspect such phenomena may due to the limited efficacy of the signed distance transforms for representing isocontours. Using our method with σ sig = 15 and σ outlier = 0, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3  (b)</ref> shows that all isocontours are merged into a single cluster, because σ sig is too large and no trend contains more than 15 isocontours. Reducing σ sig to 10, we can see the two strong modes in (c), there seem to be some outliers for both trends (i.e., isocontours that pass through region A and B for the green and red clusters respectively). By setting σ outlier = 2, we can further separate these outliers, as shown in (d).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">VISUALIZATION</head><p>The dendrogram described in Section 3.1 is a standard tool to visualize the arrangement of hierarchical clusters. In this section, we present a new visualization, called the mode plot, to encode high-density clusters which is particularly effective for understanding the distribution behavior and variability of ensemble isocontours. The proposed mode plot is further linked to the spaghetti plot for interactive explorations of interesting subsets of isocontours, including trends, high probability solutions, and solution galleries. We also propose a so-called simplified spaghetti plot to provide an interpretable overview of ensemble isocontours across multiple isovalues, from which one can select informative isovalues for detailed analysis (using linked mode and spaghetti plots). Furthermore, our framework enables interactive selections of geographical sub-regions for clustering re-analysis and local explorations of ensemble isocontours.</p><p>To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we synthesized an ensemble data, consisting of 72 members. All members are isocontours of implicit distance fields (361 × 199) of some perturbed functions. There are four trends synthesized from four sinusoidal functions (with size 15, 15, 20, and 20) and 2 outliers: a triangle wave and a square wave. The spaghetti plot of the synthetic data is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>, where the overlapping of isocontours makes it difficult to draw any useful conclusions. We perform the high-density clustering with a bandwidth selected from our proposed method with σ sig = 15 and σ outlier = 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Visual Encoding of High-density Clusters</head><p>The dendrogram, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2 (b)</ref> or <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5 (a)</ref>, primarily displays topological information of the density estimate, i.e., the creations and merges of mode branches. However, it does not sufficiently encode the connectivity between different modes which is important to understand the density estimate. For example, when two modes (say A and B) are connected in U ε , their corresponding branches are merged into a new branch. With the expansion of U ε , the two modes can be connected to another mode C, where the newly-created branch is merged with the branch of C. However, the connectivity among the three modes cannot be inferred from the dendrogram (e.g., is C connected to A or B?). Moreover, each branch represents a set of high-density clusters with the same topology, but it does not describe how the underlying cluster evolves and grows.</p><p>To overcome the limitations of dendrograms, we present the mode plot to encode high-density clusters for efficient explorations of ensemble isocontours. Our mode plot is an extension of the visualization proposed by Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, where we propose new concentric-circle glyphs to encode mode hierarchies and connectivities for the distribution of ensemble isocontours. We also introduce a number of interactions for mode plots, allowing convenient selections of desired isocontours. The basic idea for constructing a mode plot is straightforward: create a concentric circle for each mode to encode the evolution of the respective mode cluster, and connect the concentric circles when their corresponding modes are connected in U ε . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5 (b)</ref> shows the proposed mode plot for the synthetic data, which is generated with the following steps: Mode clustering and mode projection: We find local modes l 1 , . . . , l k and mode clusters of the kernel density estimate with our proposed bandwidth selection method (mean-shift algorithm can be used (Section 6)). The local modes are further projected into R 2 , denoted as l * 1 , . . . , l * k , using multidimensional scaling (MDS). Visual encoding of mode cluster evolution: We first plot the projected modes as uniquely colored hexagrams (shown in the centers of the concentric circles). Then, we uniformly sample 20 density levels ε 1 , . . . , ε 20 in the range [1/20, 1] ×f max . For each density level, ε, starting from ε 1 to ε 20 , we compute the sizes of the intersections between the mode clusters and the current high-density cluster U ε , denoted as n 1 (ε), . . . , n k (ε). If n i (ε) &gt; 0, we draw a circle around l * i whose radius is proportional to n i (ε). Each circle is further filled with the same color as its corresponding mode (i.e., the center hexagram), where the color saturation is modified based on the current density level ε and a sigmoid function: s(ε) = 1/(1 + e −9(ε/f max −0.65) ). The non-linear monotonic increasing sigmoid function maps high density levels to high color saturations, which also increases the visual contrast of circles at high, medium, and low density levels.</p><p>Visual encoding of mode connectivity: For each ε, if two modes are connected in U ε , we draw an edge between the two modes that has a width inversely proportional to ε and a gradient color varying along the connected circles. Note that all modes will eventually merge at an arbitrary low-density level, whereas we ignore such trivial connections as they do not convey much information.</p><p>The mode plot in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5 (b)</ref> clearly shows the mode structure of the density estimate, while it is difficult to perceive the same information from the dendrogram in (a). The relative positions of the concentric circle centers describe the similarity between the corresponding modes. Although modes can be readily discerned in the mode plot, modes are assigned unique colors to enable the separation and classification of isocontours in the linked spaghetti plot (Section 4.2). The maximum radius of each concentric circle reflects the size of the respective mode cluster. As such, outlier modes are represented as small isolated circles, e.g., the tiny dark blue and cyan circles. For each concentric circle, a large high-saturation core indicates the mode is seated in a high-density region, while modes born at low-density levels are encoded with small low-saturation cores. The radial changes of color saturation reflect the distribution of isocontours within mode clusters, a high contrast core and exterior implies the presence of inner-cluster outliers (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 11</ref> (d) red) whereas a low contrast concentric circle indicates isocontours have similar proximities to each other (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 9</ref> (g) red and green). A wide high-saturation line between two concentric circles means the corresponding modes are connected at a high-density level.</p><p>Both the inner-cluster variability and intra-cluster similarity influ- ence the significance of modes as well as their connectivities. For example, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5 (b)</ref>, the four large concentric circles correspond to four trends (at density regions from high to low): red, blue, green, and brown. Comparing the blue and green concentric circles, although the green is larger than the blue in maximum radius, it has a lower saturation core. Since both the green and blue concentric circles have similar distances to other trend modes (i.e., red and brown), the intra-cluster similarity is less likely to be the factor for such phenomena. Therefore, by simply inspecting the mode plot, we conclude that the lower saturation green is due to its higher inner-cluster variability compared to blue, which can be further verified via interactions (Section 4.2). On the other hand, the low-saturation brown mode and its large distances to other modes distinguish it from the high probability solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Interactive Exploration of Ensemble Isocontours</head><p>We link the mode plot with the spaghetti plot and use interactive highlighting to explore the uncertainty and variability of ensemble isocontours. The mode plot serves as an attribute space summary of the distribution of ensemble isocontours, as well as a classification widget for interactive explorations. In the spatial context, interactive highlighting in the spaghetti plot enables direct visualization of the positional variations of the selected isocontours. Our interactive framework provides a focus+context visualization that enables both an overview of the clustering structures and the selection of isocontours of interest. We propose the following interactions for selecting trends, high-probability solutions, and solution galleries:</p><p>• Mode selection: The mode plot provides an overview of the distribution of ensemble isocontours, from which we enable the selection of modes of interest and allow users to focus on different solutions (either trends or outliers). <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> demonstrates various mode selections at density level ε = 0, where the entire concentric circles for the selected modes are highlighted in the mode plot, and the corresponding isocontours are highlighted in the spaghetti plot. This operation allows users to the focus on a subset of solutions, e.g., (a) main-trend solutions, (b) an important solution with less confidence, (c) a less-likely solution, (d) outliers. The interaction can be a pre-filter and used in conjunction with other interactions.</p><p>• High-density filtration: We allow the selection of isocontours in the high-density clusters at various density levels, which helps to identify the high-probability solutions (i.e., selection of isocontours with top density values) in a global manner. <ref type="figure">Fig. 7 (a)</ref> shows the high-density filtration at density level ε = 0.6 * f max . In the mode plot, the selected high-density clusters are represented as the partially colored concentric circles, and the connections indicate the corresponding modes belong to same high-density clusters. In the spaghetti plots, the selected isocontours are highlighted, and all other isocontours are greyed out. The selected high-probability isocontours can be used as predictions in weather forecasts, where it enables flexible control of the number of highconfidence isocontours.</p><p>• Mode percentile filtration: It is often useful to generate a gallery of all possible solutions to sense the variability of ensemble isocontours <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. For each mode, we rank the isocontours within each mode cluster based on their density values, where we can specify a percentile to select high-rank isocontours (e.g., 10th percentile selects the 10% highest ranked isocontours). By default, we have four percentile levels 10th, 25th, 50th, and 95th correspond to four solution galleries, where the concentric circle glyphs in mode plots are modified to four percentile levels, and the radius of circles indicates the sizes of the selected isocontours at different levels. A gallery of all possible solutions (including outliers) for the 20th percentile is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7 (b)</ref>.</p></div>

For example, a threshold of temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity is critical for fire forecasting. However, in operational weather forecasting, the uncertainty of ensemble isocontours is frequently used to assess the uncertainty associated with the weather forecast. Since ensemble isocontours of different isovalues exhibit different variability behaviors, it is essential to select interesting isovalues that provide the most useful information <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. The brute force approach involves selecting isovalues from the spaghetti plot of a full set of isovalues, as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 8 (a)</ref>. Even though the isocontours of different isovalues are assigned unique colors, overlaying a large number of isocontours brings significant visual clutter, making it difficult to interpret. To overcome this problem, the conventional method for isovalue selection in weather forecasting uses the mean-spread plot, as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 8 (b)</ref>, where the mean field and the spread field (i.e., the standard deviation of ensemble members) are mapped to contours and colors. Since the goal is to select isovalues that carry the most uncertainty information, isovalues whose mean isocontours pass through multiple high uncertainty (or spread) regions are chosen for detailed analysis. However, this approach suffers from two drawbacks: 1. The ensemble isocontours are represented as a single mean isocontour, which could be misleading when the ensemble isocontours form clusters of diverging shapes. 2. The spread could also be misleading for regions with large gradients, since small displacements of members can lead to a large spread due to the large gradient magnitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. For example, as shown in (b), the large spreads in the eastern regions are mostly due to the large gradient (indicated by the close isolines), while the western areas have relative low spreads, even though the isocontours exhibit multiple variations as shown in (a).</p><p>We propose to select isovalues of interest from a simplified spaghetti plot which renders a set of representative isocontours for multiple isovalues. For each isovalue, we choose the rank 1 isocontours for all significant modes as representatives. Specifically, we define significant modes using the same criteria in our bandwidth selection method in Section 3.2, i.e., a significant mode has a mode cluster size ≥ σ sig . We further encode the variability of isocontours within each mode cluster to the contour width of its representatives, where a large width  <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>. The comparison of (a) the spaghetti plot, (b) the mean-spread plot, and (c) the simplified spaghetti plot for isovalue selection. The isocontours are from the Geopotential height field at 5-dam intervals of GEFS/R dataset.</p><p>indicates a high inner-mode variability. The simplified spaghetti plot shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref> (c) significantly reduces the visual clutter observed in (a). We can select informative isovalues by directly examining the positional variabilities of representative isocontours and their contour widths. For example, from (c) we can observe multiple possible trough locations in the U.S. south while this information is hard to obtain from (a). Moreover, the thin contours of these troughs indicate the low uncertainty associated with the representative isocontours. On the other hand, the thick representative isocontours in the north-east region indicate the relatively high variability within their mode clusters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Sub-region Selection and Clustering Re-analysis</head><p>We have been discussing the uncertainty and variability analysis for ensemble isocontours in a given geographical region. Forecasters are also often interested in the positional variations of ensemble isocontours at different sub-regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>, in which case clustering analysis has to be repeated, because it is sensitive to the selection of regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Although the importance of this requirement has been recognized <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, it has not been approached by existing methods. Our interactive framework allows selection of any rectangular region via brushing in the spaghetti plot and efficiently recomputes the high-density clustering for the selected region. For example, the right images of <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> show the clustering re-analysis for two selected regions, where the variability of the (middle) trough and the (eastern) ridge are better characterized in the local sense.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">RESULTS</head><p>We have conducted a number of experiments on ensemble forecasting datasets. Due to space limitations, we present some of our results; more experiments can be found in our supplemental video. Our first experiment uses the historical weather forecast dataset from 2nd-generation Global Ensemble Forecast System Reforecast (GEFS/R). The dataset is publicly available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Earth System Research Laboratory <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The dataset consists of 11 forecast members on a regular longitude-latitude grid, and the horizontal resolution is 55 km (0-8 days) and 70 km (8-16 days). Although 11 elevation layers are potentially available to enable characterization of the dataset in 3D, forecasters almost always examine the 2D slices of the dataset at different elevation levels to interpret weather predictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. We use the isocontours of the Geopotential height field at 500-hPa, initialized at 0000 UTC on 19 November 2001 and valid at 1200 UTC on 22 November 2001 in North America. This classic example has been used to study the uncertainty of ensemble weather forecasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. We set σ sig = 3 (30% of the number of members) and σ outlier = 2 for high-density clusterings. <ref type="figure">Fig. 8 (a)</ref> shows the spaghetti plot of the ensemble isocontours at 5-dam intervals. The simplified spaghetti plot, shown in (c), provides an overview of the representative isocontours and their associated uncertainties. We select three isovalues (m): 5200, 5250, and 5700 that exhibit different variabilities across multiple regions for detailed analysis. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 9</ref>, the first column shows overviews of the high-density clustering results, where all modes are selected at the lowest density level in the mode plots and isocontours are highlighted accordingly in the spaghetti plots. The second and third columns show the interactive explorations of ensemble isocontours. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 9 (a)</ref>, the mode plot shows two trends: red and green, and comparing the size and saturation of the corresponding glyphs one can conclude that the red trend is stronger. The high saturation blue glyph, as well as its connection (with a relatively wide line) to the red glyph, indicates its similarity to the red trend, i.e, it is an inner-cluster outlier. The brown glyph is also connected to the green trend; however, its relatively large distances to other glyphs and low saturation imply its distinctness. These initial conclusions can be further verified from the highlighted spaghetti plot (top), as well as the interactive selections of high-probability solutions and different modes, as shown in (b) and (c).</p><p>The mode plot in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 9 (d)</ref> summarizes the distribution of ensemble isocontours with complicated variations over multiple regions. From the highlighted spaghetti plot, we notice that the two trends (green and red) mostly differ in region B while the variations and topologies in region A are not apparent. Therefore, we select region A for clustering re-analysis (took 0.32s), and the result is shown in (e). However, the dominant red trend is still composed of isocontours with various shapes and topologies. Because of the high variability of these isocontours, it is difficult to form significant clusters that have more than σ sig (i.e., 3) members. To further structure the solution, we relax σ sig to 2 (reclustering took 0.55s), and the resulting mode plot in (f) shows one strong trend (red), one trend consists of two modes (connected green and blue), and two outliers that are connected to the red trend. The selections of the two trends are shown in the insets of the mode plot, where we observe isocontours with two different topologies. Additional interactions can be found in our supplemental video. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 9</ref> (g) -(i) show the regional analysis for <ref type="figure">Fig. 1 (c)</ref>. In <ref type="figure">Fig. 1 (c)</ref>, the mode plot shows the dominance of the red trend and the distribution of different solutions, while it is difficult to obtain the same information from the spaghetti plot. Due to the overlapping and complex shapes of isocontours, it is difficult to compare different clusters in (even color-coded) spaghetti plots directly (e.g., the blue isocontours are occluded by the red isocontours in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1 (c)</ref>). The same drawback occurs in confidence envelope-based plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>, as we will discuss in Section 6. The mode plot in (g) summarizes the local analysis, where we see four possible trough locations with different strengths in the U.S. south. Compared to the global clustering (shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1 (c)</ref>), the local analysis better captures the location variations of the troughs. The 10th percentile solution gallery for all modes is shown in (h), where we observe the differences and similarities between the four troughs. To reduce outliers, we set σ outlier = 0 for re-clustering (took 0.21s), and the representatives for the two main trends are shown in (i).</p><p>Our second experiment uses NCEP's SREF (Short-Range Ensemble Forecast), which contains 26 member runs: 13 Nonhydrostatic Multiscale Model on the B-grid (NMMB) members and 13 Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) members. The simulation runs four times per day and includes forecasts at 3-hour intervals expanding to 87 hours in duration. We use the SREF version that runs on NCEP's 243 grid, which is a longitude-latitude grid over the Eastern North Pacific. The data is publicly available from NOAA <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. We use the isocontours of the Geopotential height field at 500-hPa, initialized at 0000 UTC on 9 September 2017 and valid at 0000 UTC on 11 September 2017. We set σ sig = 8 (30% of the number of members) and σ outlier = 2 for high-density clusterings. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 10</ref> compares the spaghetti plot and the simplified spaghetti plot of ensemble isocontours at 3-dam intervals. We do not select isovalues with diverging trends, instead we select two isovalues (m) to test the performance of our approach: 5790 (representative isocontours with subtle differences) and 5880 (complex topology with high inner-cluster variations). The mode plot of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 11 (a)</ref> shows two relatively strong trends (red and green) together with a number of outliers, where four outliers are connected to the red mode and two outliers are isolated. Again, this information cannot be obtained from the cluttered spaghetti plot shown at the top. The high-density filtration at ε = 0.8 * f max is shown in (b), where the high-density isocontours from both the red and green trends are selected as a prediction. The isolated outliers are shown in (c). Since the isocontours are mainly composed of two disconnected components in two geographical regions, we select the component in the eastern part for regional analysis (re-clustering took 0.20s). The clustering result in (d) shows one main trend (red) and one outliers (picked out in (e)). The low saturation exterior of the red glyph indicates that there are additional outliers in the underlying trend. Therefore, we increased σ outlier to 5 and performed clustering re-analysis (took 0.66s) to separate these outliers from the main trend. The newly extracted outliers are shown in (f). In (g), although the red isocontours exhibit higher variability compared to the green ones (as shown in the spaghetti plot), the red trend is actually stronger (indicated by the mode plot) due to its large size. The high probability solutions with ε = 0.8 * f max are presented in (e), which further shows the dominance of the red trend. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 11 (f)</ref> shows the 10th percentile representative isocontours, where we see a cleaner plot to examine the positional differences of isocontours from the two trends.</p><p>We compute the signed distance transforms of isocontours from scalar fields using an efficient image-based method. Our method is inspired by the Marching Cubes algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, where cells that are crossed by an isosurface are used to extract the triangle meshes of the isosurface. For 2D scalar fields, a cell in a Cartesian grid is a square between four neighboring grid points. A cell is crossed by an isocontour if the isovalue falls between the minimum and maximum of the scalar values of its four grid points. Therefore, we can form a binary image of cells, where each pixel represents a cell and is assigned value 1 if the underlying isocontour crosses the cell. Thus, we use the signed distance transform of the binary image as an approximation. The accuracy of using the binary image to approximate the geometry of an isocontour depends on the resolution of the data. Fortunately, one can always increase the resolution of the scalar field by subdividing the cells of the original grid into smaller cells and interpolating data over the finer grid <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref>, the finer the subdivision, the more accurately the binary image represents the isocontour. Note that the subdivision also increases the resolution of the signed distance transforms. However, it does not bring extra overhead to our clustering process, as the dimension of the isocontours is bounded by the number of ensemble members. Although the high-density clusters are defined based on the density estimate, our interest is the evolution of population clusters, not the density estimate itself. Thus, we can avoid evaluation of the density estimate, which is very expensive for high-dimensional data. Our implementation is based on the relationship between the (hierarchical) high-density clustering and the (flat) mode clustering, as described in Section 4.1. Intuitively, one can treat the high-density clustering as a hierarchical version of the mode clustering. First, we use the mean-shift algorithm, together with our proposed bandwidth selection method, to find the modes and mode clusters. The high-density clusters at level ε are composed of the intersections of the mode clusters and U ε . Then, for any pairs of modes, we need to determine whether they are connected in U ε . Several methods have been proposed for solving this problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. In particular, an efficient heuristic -modes are not connected if there is a low-density region (that is not in U ε ) between the modes -is suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. For any two mode clusters that intersect U ε , a density estimation is performed along the line segment formed by the closest points between the two clusters. Then, the density values for samples along the line are examined, and the two modes are not connected if there is a sample whose density value is smaller than ε. However, this approximation is insufficient for high-dimensional data, as a single line covers only very limited areas. In our implementation, we extend this idea and examine the regions that are covered by the line segments between every pair of data points from the two clusters. We use an efficient C-based library <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> for the implementation of the mean-shift algorithm. The average pre-processing time (over the set of isovalues) for bandwidth selection and overall clustering (on a machine with Intel Core i7 3.6 GHz CPU, 16 GB RAM) is 0.0072s and 0.33s for the GEFF/R dataset and 0.14s and 0.94s for the SREF dataset.</p><p>Our method naturally provides a density ranking for ensemble isocontours, which can be potentially used to generate confidence envelopes as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>. For example, we can use mode clusters to form bands. For each mode cluster, we create a 50th percentile band enclosed by a 100th percentile band similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. The confidence bands for isovalue (m) 5250 and 5350 of the GEFF/R dataset are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 13</ref>. From the confidence bands, we obtain both qualitative and quantitative interpretations of shapes of isocontours and the associated variability. However, this method suffers from a similar problem as the spaghetti plots; that is, it is difficult to compare isocontours of different trends directly. The clusters of isocontours are abstracted into confidence bands, and it is difficult to obtain information like the number of isocontours within each band and the positional differences between the isocontours. For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 13 (a)</ref>, it is not possible to compare the significance of the two trends as in the mode plot of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 9 (a)</ref>. Therefore, we chose not to integrate the confidence band method into our framework. Instead, we prefer a direct visualization of isocontours (using interactive highlighting) with the guidance of the proposed mode plot. However, we envision that confidence envelope methods could be useful for visualizations of 3D ensembles, as overlaying isosurfaces with transparent layers often do not provide an effective visualization due to occlusions. In the future, we plan to extend our framework for 3D ensemble datasets and investigate the confidence envelope technique for the visualization of 3D isosurfaces. One of the limitations of our approach is the possible occlusion problem in the mode plot. For example, when there are many outlier clusters that connect to strong modes, it is possible that the connections (or edges) may intersect each other or even occlude other (tiny) modes. Although this happens rarely in our experiments, we plan to further improve the mode plot by modifying the objective function of MDS to have a more intelligent arrangement of modes. The simplified spaghetti plot is still a contour plot that overlays multiple isocontours and therefore inherits the limitation of conventional spaghetti plots; that is, it does not scale well. As the data load increases, the simplified spaghetti plot eventually becomes cluttered and not useful. Therefore, we plan to improve our isovalue selection method using our abstract summary product -the mode plot. For example, one possible solution is to stack the mode plots of consecutive isovalues to generate a 3D scalar field. Then, one might infer the distribution of ensemble isocontours across a dense set of isovalues (i.e., each isovalue corresponds to a slice) from the visualization of the 3D scalar field using volume rendering. With a similar idea, we also plan to extend the mode plot for the exploration of the temporal growth of the uncertainty in ensemble forecasts. Finally, we note that the proposed clustering approach can also be applied to the underlying fields of ensemble data as these fields can be treated as vectors. However, statistical analysis of the underlying fields is different from the analysis of ensemble isocontours of these fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. We plan to investigate this problem and develop visualizations to further understand the discrepancies and connections between the underlying fields and their ensemble isoconoturs for uncertainty analysis.</p></div>
