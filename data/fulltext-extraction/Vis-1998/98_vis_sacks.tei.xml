				<p>We are studying difficult geometric problems in computeraided mechanical design where visualization plays a key role. The research addresses the fundamental design task of contact analysis: deriving the part contacts and the ensuing motion constraints in a mechanical system. We have automated contact analysis of general planar systems via configuration space computation. Configuration space is a geometric representation of rigid-body interaction that encodes quantitative information, such as part motion paths, and qualitative information, such as system failure modes. The configuration space dimension equals the number of degrees of freedom in the system. Three-dimensional spaces are most important, but higher-dimensions are often useful. The qualitative aspects, which relate to the topology of the configuration space, are best understood by visualization. We explain what configuration space is, how it encodes contact information, and what research challenges it poses for visualization.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>We are studying difficult geometric problems in computeraided mechanical design where visualization plays a key role. Mechanical design is the task of creating a system of parts that performs a function reliably and economically. It is a ubiquitous activity that spans mechanical, electrical, and biomedical engineering. Some common systems are automobile transmissions, robot manipulators, micro-mechanisms, and prosthetic devices. <ref type="bibr">Designers</ref>  and compare prototypes to produce optimal designs. Design software reduces design time and improves quality by shifting some of this activity from physical to electronic prototypes.</p><p>Our research addresses the fundamental design task of contact analysis. Contacts are the physical primitives that make mechanical systems out of collections of parts. Systems perform functions by transforming motions via part contacts. The shapes of the interacting parts impose constraints on their motions that largely determine the system function. Contact analysis is the task of deriving and analyzing these constraints. Designers use contact analysis to validate function, to measure performance, to correct design flaws, and to assign part tolerances (allowable shape variations due to manufacturing imprecision).</p><p>We illustrate contact analysis on the film advance of a movie camera <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>). The mechanism consists of a driver cam, a follower, and a film strip attached to a frame. The driver cam rotates counter-clockwise about a shaft on the frame, while the enclosing follower is attached to the frame by a pin joint. The film translates vertically in a plane orthogonal to the page. The part contacts determine the mechanical function of the system. The cam pushes the right side of the square follower profile, which moves the follower right until its tip engages the film. Next, it pushes the bottom of the square profile, which moves the tip down, which advances the film by one segment. Next, it pushes the left side of the profile, which disengages the follower tip from the film. Finally, it pushes the top of the profile, which raises the follower in preparation for the next cycle. Although this is the desired function, extensive analysis is required to validate it.</p><p>We have developed software that automates contact analysis via configuration space computation [9, 8, 7]. Configuration space is a geometric representation of rigid-body interaction that encodes the requisite contact information for mechanical design. It encodes quantitative information, such as part motion paths, and qualitative information, such as system failure modes. The software computes configuration spaces for planar systems, which account for over 90% of mechanical design applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>. It implements quantitative queries that support simulation, parametric design, tolerancing, and other design tasks. It provides limited visualization capabilities for exploring the qualitative aspects of cam film follower pin joint In this paper, we explain what configuration space is, how it encodes contact information, and what research challenges it poses for visualization. We use small, but realistic examples to show that simple visualization techniques shed new light on difficult design tasks. We explain why other tasks require novel visualization capabilities. Our aim is to alert the visualization community to this research opportunity and to foster an exchange of ideas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Configuration space</head><p>Configuration space is a general representation for rigid part interaction that is widely used in robot motion planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6]</ref>. We model the interactions of pairs of planar parts with three-dimensional configuration spaces whose points specify the spatial position u; v and orientation of one part with respect to the other ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). Configuration space partitions into three disjoint sets that characterize part interaction: blocked space where the parts overlap, free space where they do not touch, and contact space where they touch without overlap. Blocked space represents unrealizable configurations, free space represents independent part motions, and contact space represents motion constraints due to part contacts. Free and blocked space are open sets whose common boundary is contact space.</p><p>We illustrate these concepts on the cam/follower pair of the film advance. <ref type="figure">Figure 3a</ref> shows a configuration space cross-section, which represents part translations at the orientation in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>  between the top arc of the cam and the top of the follower inner profile. The free space is the interior of the square. The width (height) of the free space measures the maximum horizontal (vertical) distance that the follower can translate, which is the play necessary for the proper functioning of the film advance. <ref type="figure">Figure 3b</ref> shows the full configuration space. The contact space forms a narrow spiral channel whose interior is the free space and whose exterior is the blocked space. Every crosssection is a square like the one in <ref type="figure">Figure 3a</ref> The key qualitative property of the configuration space is that the channel forms a spiral that spans the full range of cam orientations. The spiral shape implies that the follower moves right, down, left, and up. The full range implies that the cam rotates through the four stages without jamming. Narrowing the follower slot or widening the cam transforms the free space into a worm shape whose head and tail consist of jamming configurations beyond which the cam cannot proceed <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 4)</ref>. The quantitative aspects of the configuration space include the range of vertical follower travel, which must match the film spacing, and the channel width, which measures part play.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Visualization challenges</head><p>The film advance configuration space is simple enough that simple visualization techniques such as cross-sections and polyhedral rendering reveal its qualitative features. However, most designs involve configuration spaces that are far too complex for these techniques. We illustrate this with a micro-mechanism developed at Sandia National Laboratory ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>). Micro-mechanical fabrication is a new technology that poses unique challenges for computer-aided design because of the micron scale, the large number of parts, the high shape accuracy, the novel physics, and the tight coupling of mechanics with electronics. We focus on the gear/pinion pair in the indexing assembly whose function is to advance the gear by one tooth per pinion rotation. We first assume that the parts rotate freely, but do not translate, which would be true if they were attached to the frame by ideal pin joints. This assumption allows us to work with a two-dimensional configuration space whose coordinates are the two part orientations ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>), instead of a three-dimensional space. Contact space consists of many short contact curves that represent contacts between the pinion and the gear teeth. The left part of the configuration space consists of narrow, slanted channels in which the part motions are coupled. As the pinion rotates clockwise, the configuration moves horizontally left until it reaches the nearest channel boundary then follows the boundary up, meaning that the the gear rotates counter-clockwise. The right part of the configuration space represents the rotation of the pinion from when it exits the channel on the left (breaks contact with the gear) until it reaches the right side of the channel above.</p><p>The ideal design ignores a crucial aspect of the fabrication process: joint play. Every pair of parts must be separated by 0.5 microns or else the fabrication process will fuse pinion gear <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>: Configuration space for gear/pinion pair without play.</p><p>them. This means that the pinion and the gear each has three degrees of freedom: 0.5 microns of horizontal translation relative to its hub, 0.5 microns of vertical translation, and unrestricted rotation. We must study their three-dimensional configuration space instead of the ideal, planar space. The same is true of every pair that is fabricated with current technology. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows 1/64 of the configuration space of the gear moving relative to the pinion. This figure, which contains 3664 contact patches, is incomprehensible to experienced configuration space researchers. Imagine the full space with some 250,000 patches! We need visualization tools that reduce configuration space complexity by suppressing irrelevant detail. Developing these tools raises challenging visualization problems.</p><p>The first simplification is to examine configuration space cross-sections, as in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. The notched contact curves are the cross-sections of the channels in the three-dimensional contact space. The circle marks the range of motion due to joint play. Everything outside the circle is irrelevant. The next simplification is clipping. Each cross-section has its own circle. Their union forms a twisted tube in the full configuration space. We would like to clip everything outside this tube. To our knowledge, this type of nonlinear clipping is beyond the scope of current algorithms.</p><p>The clipping tube is useful because the part translations are small compared to the rotations. This means that the full space is somehow close to the ideal space in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. We would like to represent the ideal space as a hyper-surface in the full space. We could then transfer the qualitative features of the ideal space to the full space and study the quantitative features by perturbation analysis (local linearization). The problem is that the ideal space is a nonlinear subspace of the full space, most likely an embedded sub-manifold. Displaying such subspaces is our second visualization challenge. We can also reduce configuration space complexity by exploiting symmetry. The gear/pinion space is symmetric under rotation by =32 radians, so we need only examine 1=64 of it. This degree of symmetry is atypical, but some symmetry is common. Another example of complexity reduction is to study small sets of critical contacts, often two adjacent patches is enough, that are chosen by the designer based on simulation, intuition, or other methods. Another option is to visualize several slices in conjunction while displaying correspondences between equivalent contact curves.</p><p>Some design tasks involve configuration spaces of higher dimensions. Pairs of spatial parts have six dimensional configuration spaces. Interactions among sets of parts, such as the entire indexing assembly, occur in higher dimensional spaces. A system configuration is free when no parts touch, is blocked when two parts overlap, and is in contact when two parts touch and no parts overlap. Direct visualization of these spaces is infeasible. We can visualize the configuration spaces of the interacting pairs, which are 3D projections of the n-part space, but it is difficult to determine the global topology from the projections. Intelligent projection techniques are needed to resolve this issue. The challenges are to find subspaces that reveal the relevant part interactions and to visualize them in a perspicuous way.</p><p>Specific design tasks pose their own visualization problems. Simulation raises the need to visualize part motions, which generate paths in configuration space. One option is to animate the parts while tracing the corresponding configurations in the full or projected configuration spaces. This technique also helps us probe the system configuration space topology without fully constructing it. Tolerance analysis raises the need to visualize parametric families of configuration spaces that represent the functional effects of manufacturing variations on part geometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions</head><p>We have seen that configuration space visualization provides mechanical designers with important qualitative information about design prototypes. Basic visualization techniques suffice for planar configuration spaces and for simple 3D spaces. The outstanding problem is how to detect qualitative patterns in complex 3D spaces, while the longterm task is to visualize higher dimensional spaces. These challenges are prime candidates for interdisciplinary research in mechanical engineering and computer science.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Film advance mechanism of a movie camera. configuration space.</figDesc></figure>
