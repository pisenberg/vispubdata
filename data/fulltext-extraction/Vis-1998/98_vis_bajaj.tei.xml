				<p>Scalar fields arise in every scientific application. Existing scalar visualization techniques require that the user infer the global scalar structure from what is frequently an insufficient display of information. We present a visualization technique which numerically detects the structure at all scales, removing from the user the responsibility of extracting information implicit in the data, and presenting the structure explicitly for analysis. We further demonstrate how scalar topology detection proves useful for correct visualization and image processing applications such as image co-registration, isocontouring, and mesh compression.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Visualization of scalar fields is common across all scientific disciplines, including geographic data such as altitude and temperature, medical applications with CT and MRI values, and pressure and vorticity magnitude in computational fluid dynamics. The purpose of the visualization is to aid the user in understanding the structure of the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Common methods for visualizing scalar fields can be grouped into two broad classes. First are methods whose aim is to detect structure and present a display to the user which communicates this structure. Critical to these methods is the definition of structure, and how well the definition matches the visualization users' need. Second are those methods which attempt to display the entire scalar field simultaneously, leaving interpretationof the display to the user. Combinations of the two methods serve to reinforce the information provided by each visualization. We will use for comparison one technique from each of these categories, isocontouring and colormapping.</p><p>Isocontours, or constant valued curves and surfaces from continuous 2D and 3D scalar fields, are a common visualization technique for displaying scalar field structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. By their definition, isocontours represent the data only at discrete levels, and as such are an effective technique for determining the "shape" of objects in the scalar field. Shape extraction as defined by isocontours is well understood and appreciated in many applications, such as Medical Imaging, as isocontours in a density field may result in realistic models of skeletal structure, skin surface, or various organs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Also implicit in their definition is the fact that isocontours are an incomplete representation of the scalar field, as one can only infer from an isocontour that the data to one side is above the isovalue, and the data to the other side is below the isovalue. With multiple isocontours, the scalar field effectively becomes segmented into a finite number of ranges, within which the structure remains unknown. The same claim of incompleteness can be made of any technique which only displays a portion of the field. Moreover it is not obvious which isovalues one should select and how namy of them <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Colormapping of scalar data defines a discrete or continuous range of colors onto which the scalar values are mapped. Use of color, though proven to be useful in many visualization techniques, introduces complications due of perceptual issues, such as colorblindness. Colormaps may also mislead the user, for example when small-scale structure in the data is washed out due to the large range of values taken on by the variable.</p><p>Scientific data which is time-varying in nature intensifies the problems with the methods described above. In the typical case, a scalar variable may take on a wide range of values over the course of a simulation, however at certain times during the simulation the range may be much smaller. With both isocontours and colormapped display, it is desirable to use the same isovalues and colormap for each time-step being displayed in order to reduce the possibility of introducing artifacts which may be misinterpreted as features. This requirement complicates the task of choosing a good colormap or selection of isovalues for a time-varying visualization.</p><p>In this paper we present a complementary scalar structure visualization technique which does not depend on the user to determine structure from the graphical display, but instead defines, computes, and displays the structure of a scalar field directly. Through detection of all critical points (saddles, maxima, and minima), we construct an embedded graph by Curves in this topological graph are always perpendicular to isocontours of the scalar field <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and we will demonstrate that these curves contain complementary information to that provided by display of isocontours or colormapped scalar fields, providing a method which is both useful in its own right and which also enhances the commonly used techniques for visualizing scalar fields. We further indicate that the definition of structure which is provided by the scalar topology proves useful in several additional visualization and image processing applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Much of the work in enhancing colormapped visualization of scalar fields has dealt with determining "good" colormaps which effectively display the data. Bergman, et. al., define rules based on perception, user goals, and data characteristics to automatically select a colormap which will meet the user requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Histogram equalization is a technique which spreads the data evenly over the range of colors, using the available color space to it's fullest <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The result is that each color in the colormap is used an equal number of times. Gershon <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> uses "Generalized Animation" to display otherwise static scalar data in a dynamic way, taking advantage of the ability of the visual system to detect dynamic changes. Animation draws attention to fuzzy details in the data which may not be detected in the static representation.</p><p>There has been several papers in detecting isocontours in 2d and 3d scalar data <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Additional work concentrates on handling problems in regions containing saddle points which cause difficulty in determining the topological structure of the surface contained in the region <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. The problem of detecting ridges and valleys in digital terrain has been treated in several papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">McCormack, et. al.</ref> consider the problem of detecting drainage patterns in geographic terrain <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Interrante, et. al.</ref> have used ridge and valley detection on 3d surfaces to enhance the shape of trans-parently rendered surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Extrema graphs were used by Itoh and Koyamada to speed isocontour extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. A graph containing extreme points and boundary points of a scalar field can be guaranteed to intersect every isocontour at least once, allowing seed points to be generated by searching only the cells contained in the extrema graph.</p><p>Helman and Hesselink detect vector field topology by classifying the zeros of a vector field and performing particle tracing from saddle points <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The resulting partitioning consists of regions which are topologically equivalent to uniform flow. Globus, et. al. describe a software system for 3d vector topology and briefly note that the technique may also be applied to the gradient of a scalar field in order to identify maxima and minima <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Bader et. al. and Collard et. al. examine the gradient field of the charge density in a molecular system <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. The topology of this scalar field represents the bonds linking together the atoms of the molecule. Bader goes on to show how features higher level structures in the topology represent chains, rings, an cages in the molecule. Bader's example is a defining motivation for developing the automatic extraction and visualization of topology from a scalar field. In many situations, topology provides a more intuitive and physically meaningful visualization. Grosse <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> also presents methods of approximating the scalar topology of the electron density function of proteins. One of his methods uses tensor product B-spline fits while the other scales Fourier coefficients of the electron density function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Scalar Topology</head><p>Previous techniques for enhancing scalar field visualization attempt to address the inability of colormapping and isocontouring to capture and directly represent features in the data. We address this problem not through feature enhancement using existing visualization techniques, but through direct feature detection and display. For our purpose of detection and display, we define the topology of a scalar field S defined with domain D to consist of the following: tangent to the gradient field of S. Intuitively, these curves represent the path followed by a heat-seeking particle in a temperature field, or the path followed by a ball rolling down a hill in a field of elevation values. In vector field topology, the curves advected in the flow field segment the field into regions which are topologically equivalent to uniform flow. In the case of scalar topology, integral curves segment the field into regions in which the gradient flow is uniform, or in other words, the scalar function is monotonic. Such a segmentation of the scalar field into regions of simple behavior reveals the structure of the scalar field for the visualization user.</p><p>We outline the procedure for visualization of scalar topology as follows:</p><p>1. Detect stationary (critical) points in S.</p><p>2. Classify stationary points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Integrate selected integral curves in gradient field.</head><p>In the following subsections, we will define our model of a continuous scalar field and look at each of the steps defined above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Scalar Field Model</head><p>In typical scientific applications, data is represented at the nodes of a mesh of elements and interpolated linearly across the interior of the elements. Such a data model is C 0 continuous and has a discontinuous gradient field, making it unsuitable for our purpose of tracing integral curves in the gradient field. We seek to construct a data model such that:</p><p>1. The original nodal data is interpolated.</p><p>2. The gradient at the boundaries is C 0 continuous.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Critical points in the scalar field are not removed, and</head><p>the number introduced is kept small. We could satisfy the first two properties by computing derivatives by a method such as central differencing, which would uniquely define a C 1 continuous bi-cubic scalar interpolant <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. However, such a choice of interpolant is likely to violate our third requirement by introducing critical points, as illustrated for the 1-D case in figure 2.</p><p>To address this problem, we use a "damped" central differencing scheme as described in the following sections. The resulting scalar field will remain a piecewise C 1 continuous bicubic function, which we represent in Bernstein-Bézier form as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S = 3 X i=0 3 X j=0 w i;j B 3 i xB 3 j y x; y 2 0; 1 where B n i t = n i t i 1 , t n,i</formula><p>As a result, the derivatives of the scalar field can be represented as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">@S @x = 2 X i=0 3 X j=0 3w i+1;j , w i;j B 2 i xB 3 j y @S @y = 3 X i=0 2 X j=0 3w i;j +1 , w i;j B 3 i xB 2 j y @ 2 S @x@y = 2 X i=0 2 X j=0 9w i+1;j+1 , w i;j+1 , w i;j + w i+1;j B 2 i xB 2 j y</formula><p>Having computed the damped partial derivatives and mixed partials for each vertex, the weights w i;j are computed according to the above equations. For x; y = 0 ; 0,weget: w 0;0 = S 0;0</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">w 0;1 = S 0;0 + 1 3 @S @x w 1;0 = S 0;0 + 1 3 @S @y w 1;1 = S 0;0 + 1 3 @S @x + 1 3 @S @y + 1 9 @ 2 S @x@y</formula><p>Similar equations follow for the other three vertices of a cell in 2D. The method presented for computing damped central differences in the following sections is based on the above equations for the weights of the surface S, and is developed with the goal of satisfying our scalar model criteria defined above.</p><p>For further information on smooth surface representations and for modeling scalar fields, see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. There is also a sparse body of literature concerning curve and surface interpolation which retains shape, where shape is generally thought of in terms of monotonicity or convexity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. If y 1 y 0 and y 1 y 2 , assign @S=@x = 0 . Thus we preserve that a maximum in the linear field remains a critical point in the interpolated field.</p><p>Likewise, if y 1 y 0 and y 1 y 2 , assign @S=@x = 0 .</p><p>Otherwise, the point data at x 0 , x 1 , and x 2 are monotonic, and we dampen the central difference as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">@S=@x = signx 1 _ minabs y 2 , y 0 x 2 , x 0 ; abs 3y 1 , y 0 2x 1 , x 0 ; abs 3y 2 , y 1 2x 2 , x 1</formula><p>where signx 1 = ,1 if the data is monotonically decreasing at x 1 and signx 1 = 1 if the data is monotonically increasing.</p><p>The first two conditions guarantee that extreme points of the linear line segments remain critical points in the cubic interpolant. The third condition is motivated by the control polygon of the resulting cubic curve. As illustrated in <ref type="figure">figure</ref> 3, damping the central difference by a multiple of the one sided difference guarantees that the control points between x 1 and x 2 will lie within the ranges y 1 ; y 1 + y 2 =2 and y 1 +y 2 =2; y 2 , respectively. Thus, we assure that the control points within each segment will be monotonic, and guarantee that the derivative in this segment will not vanish, as illustrated in the closeup in figure 4</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Two and higher dimensional derivatives</head><p>In two dimensions, the first partials @S=@x and @S=@y are handled as in the one-dimensional case, with one minor exception. Rather than scaling each component of the gradient, What remains in the 2D case is to compute the mixed partial @ 2 S=@x@y. For this, we again resort to the equations for computing the weights w i;j . Having computed the first partials, our weights are fixed along all edges of the mesh, as illustrated in figure 5. We would like to constrain the mixed partial at each vertex such that the four interior weights adjacent to the vertex are guaranteed to satisfy the monotonicity condition in both directions, which is effectively equivalent to eight one-dimensional constraints. This is clearly overconstrained, and examples for which @ 2 S=@x@y cannot meet all constraints are easy to construct. We compute the eight linear constraints and examine them to see if there exists a simultaneous solution. If there is not, then we set @ 2 S=@x@y = 0 in order to minimize the twist on the resulting patch <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. We point out the fact that we maintain monotonicity along the edges to guarantee that a bi-linear cell which contains a saddle point will contain a saddle in the shape preserving inter- </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Computing Critical Points</head><p>Critical points of a scalar function are defined as points at which the gradient vanishes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. For a bicubic function (2D) or tricubic function (3D), computing the positions of critical points amounts to solving a non-linear system of equations. However, due to the special construction of our interpolant, we have knowledge about where the critical points will occur, and can compute them quite efficiently.</p><p>Critical points which occur at the vertices of the mesh will be preserved, and can be computed from the bilinear or trilinear field respectively, with the guarantee that they exist as well in the higher order shape preserving interpolant. Critical points interior to a cell will occur in locations at which the monotonicityconstraint could not be met. In smooth parts of the field, there will be no problem computing a monotone field, which will guarantee the absence of critical points. In cells at which constraints were violated, we perform subdivision of the cell in order to locate the critical points, followed by Newton-Rhapson iteration to refine the positions of the zeroes. Saddles from the initial bilinear or trilinear mesh can be approximated by computing the position of the bilinear or trilinear saddle analytically, followed by iteration in the bicubic or tri-cubic field, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Classification of Critical Points</head><p>Qualitative information about the behavior of the gradient field near a critical point is obtained by analysis of the Hessian of S, given for 2D: "</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">@ 2 S @ x 2 @ 2 S @ x @ y @ 2 S @ y @ x @ 2 S @ y 2</formula><p>The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the above matrix determine the behavior of the gradient field and hence the scalar field near the critical point, much the same as for the behavior of a general vector field <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. One difference to note is that for a gradient field, the matrix of derivatives is symmetric (@ 2 S=@x@y = @ 2 S=@y@x), and therefore the eigenvalues will all be real. This is intuitively expected, as imaginary eigenvalues indicate rotation about the critical point, and a gradient field is an irrotational vector field. This observation allows us to simplify the classification of critical points as depicted in figure 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maxima</head><p>Minima Regular Saddle Constant Degenerate Saddle <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>: Some of the scalar critical points A positive eigenvalue corresponds to gradient flow away from the critical point, while a negative eigenvalue indicates gradient flow toward the critical point. In the case of a saddle point, there is gradient flow toward and away from the critical point, distinguishing it from the field behavior near other critical points. In this case, the eigenvectors corresponding to the positive and negative eigenvalues define the principal directions of the flow toward and away from the saddle, respectively. It is this property that will be used in the next section to compute critical curves in the gradient field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Tracing Integral Curves</head><p>Having computed and classified the critical points, the final step for computing the scalar topology is the tracing of selected critical curves between the detected points. Even for three and higher dimensional scalar fields we restrict our focus to only computing critical curves, and ignore critical surfaces and hypersurfaces and other degeneracies in the field, Saddle points have the property that the eigenvectors of the Hessian are the separatrices of the saddle. A particle following the gradient field along the these directions will come to rest at the saddle point, while particles slightly to either side of the separatrices will diverge rapidly near the point. It is for this reason that saddle points and the critical curves associated with their separatrices are useful in determining the structure of a scalar field. The number of critical curves emanating from saddles along separatrices is twice the field dimension. In 2D, four critical curves are computed for each saddle point, two in the direction corresponding to the posi-tive eigenvalue, and two in the direction corresponding to the negative eigenvalue. In 3D, the number is six, and so on.</p><p>Integral curves are computed using the following 4th order adaptive step Runge Kutta integration in the gradient field <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, where t is the time step which adapts per iteration, andx n is a field point :</p><p>1.k 1 = tṽx n 2.k 2 = tṽx n +~k 1 2 3.k 3 = tṽx n +~k 2 2 4.k 4 = tṽx n +k 3 <ref type="bibr">5.</ref>x n+1 =x n +~k <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> 6 +~k 2 3 +~k 3 3 +~k <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> 6 + Ot 5</p><p>The initial position for the iterative stepping is placed a small distance from the saddle point along the appropriate eigenvector. The steps are bounded such that we take no less than 5 steps per cell, maintaining a high level of accuracy. Computation of the critical curve ends when we reach the vicinity of another critical point within a certain , in which case the curve terminates at that point. Other curves may end at the boundaries of the mesh.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Quality Comparison</head><p>Here we compare the qualities of scalar topology visualization with those of isocontours and colormapping.</p><p>Integral curves are everywhere orthogonal to isocontours. The two techniques arise from an orthogonal definition of "structure" for a scalar variable. Contours are an attempt to compute and display the exact shape of an object in a scalar field, while the topology graph attempts to show the relations among all such objects in the field, without giving the details of shapes of particular objects. Note that scalar field topology is invariant under translation and uniform scaling. This quality is very similar to colormapping of scalar variables, in which the entire range of variables is mapped into a color space. Translation and scaling of the scalar variables changes only the mapping function, not the result. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> demonstrates the use of scalar topology along with both isocontours and colormapped visualizations of density in an off-axis pion collision. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>(a) uses a simple greyscale colormap, and it is clear that much of the area of interest in the center is washed out. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>(b) uses a huebased colormap varying from blue (low) to red (high), revealing more of the structure. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>(c) adds isocontours of three isovalues to aid the perception. In <ref type="figure">figure 8(d)</ref>, we show the scalar topology of density. This image clearly brings out the detail of the structure of the variable. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>(e) shows a closeup of the interesting topological regions, and figure 8(f) combines this with the isocontours for a combination of all three visualization techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Examples</head><p>While small scale structure is important in many scientific applications, in some circumstances the visualization user is interested only in large scale structure. For this situation, we apply a filter to smooth the data before applying the topology detection algorithm. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows a two visualizations of topology in a scalar field representing wind speed. In <ref type="figure">figure  9(a)</ref>, the unfiltered scalar field topology reveals some noise in the data. <ref type="figure">Figure 9(b)</ref> shows the topology for the same data after a Gaussian filter has been applied. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows an example of scalar topology applied to a mathematically defined surface. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 10(a)</ref>, the scalar topology is displayed. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 10(b)</ref>, both topology and four isocontours are displayed. Notice that even with four isolevels displayed, there are critical points within contour regions which are not revealed like the two maxima on the bottom left that are not separated by any isocontour. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows an example of scalar topology applied to a 3D scalar fields (the wave function computed for a high potential iron protein).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Other Applications</head><p>Computation of scalar topology has the potential to serve many other visualization and image processing applications. We mention only a few here:</p><p>Data Correlation -Due in part to the invariance under translation and scaling, scalar topology is useful in visually determining linear correlation between multiple scalar variables.</p><p>Image Co-registration -Scalar topology in adjacent planes provides a "1D skeleton" which may be used to align the planes.</p><p>Warping/Morphing -Editing of the scalar backbone may be used to apply a warping effect to an image, or to warp between the backbones of two similar images.</p><p>Mesh Reduction -The scalar topology may serve as a guide to aid in computation of reduced resolution meshes.</p><p>Surface Triangulation -Adaptive triangulation of arbitrary mathematical surfaces by decomposition into monotonic patches which may be subdivided to an arbitrary precision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>Existing scalar visualization techniques lack the ability to explicitly present the structure of a scalar field to the user. We have presented a definition of scalar structure and a straightforward algorithm for computing and displaying the structure. For typical scientific data, the scalar data model remains true to the original linear data, minimizing introduction of false critical points, and also simplifying the detection of critical points. The resulting topology visualization serves to both provide information which is not available in commonly used scalar visualization techniques, as well as reinforcing or enhancing the information provided by common visualization techniques. Furthermore, computation of scalar topology offers promise toward improving several visualization and image processing applications. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Isocontours (dotted) of part of a scalar field along with the critical points and integral curves computing integral curves in the gradient field from saddle points to an attached critical point, as illustrated in figure 1.</figDesc></figure>
