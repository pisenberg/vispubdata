			<abstract>
				<p>The development of a high speed multi-frequency continuous scan sonar at Sonar Research &amp; Development Ltd has resulted in the acquisition of extremely accurate, high resolution bathymetric data. This rich underwater data provides new challenges and possibilities within the field of seabed visualization. This paper introduces the reader to seabed visualization by describing two example case studies which use the Seabed Visualization System developed at SRD. Both case studies, harbour wall and shipwreck visualization, are implemented using real survey data. The high resolution of the data obtained means slight changes in the seabed topography are easily distinguishable. Annual survey inspections in both case studies enable comparisons to be made between the data sets making the visualization system an important tool for management and planning.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>This paper focuses on the process of visualizing and interacting with the vast quantities of data returned from a sonar site survey. Correct visualization of the data will provide the viewer with a wealth of information facilitating planning and decision making. Visualization of the seabed has been increasingly important for the application of activities such as route survey, pipeline inspection, dredging surveys, wreck inspection, harbour wall inspection and debris search and recovery. Pratson and Haxby <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> provide an excellent example of larger economically motivated government projects such as mapping the continental margins of the U.S. _______________________________ Section 2 of this paper focuses on the various methods of seabed data acquisition and introduces the reader to the components of SRD's Seabed Visualization System. Two case studies are considered in Section 3: the modelling of a harbour wall in Holland and the visualization of the sunken military vessel, the SS Richard Montgomery which sank during the Second World War.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">SEABED DATA ACQUISITION</head><p>For over two thousand years, seafarers have calculated their depth by letting out copious amounts of line attached to heavy rocks. This crude method was used extensively up until the early 1920s when scientists developed the first echo sounders <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . Sonar (an acronym for SOund NAvigation and Ranging), is a technique for determining the distance and direction of underwater objects by acoustic means <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. Sound waves are reflected (or emitted) from the object and are detected by sonar apparatus and analysed for the information they contain. Sonar was initially considered as a method for the detection of submarines and icebergs. By 1918 an operational system had been built by U.S. and British scientists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1 -SRD's Seabed Visualization System</head><p>Today's sonar technology is extremely advanced and the development of the Seabed Visualization System <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, provides accurate on-line high definition three dimensional models of the seabed. The system is highly portable and can be <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the major components of the Seabed Visualization System. The raw sonar data is collected using the sonar sensors and passed from the electronics Pod to the PC rack where it is digitised, displayed and logged. The Pod contains the electronics that control the transducers and receivers.</p><p>In order to calculate the precise position of the vessel, software in the PC rack reads in the ship's position via the GPS system, heave, pitch and roll data from the ship's motion sensor and tide information from the tide gauge. The survey vessel will be travelling approximately 2 metres every second. The amount of seabed highlighted by the SVS sonar system is approximately three times water depth. For example, at a water depth of 10 metres, a 30 metre strip of seabed will be highlighted. The large quantities of data returned from the site survey (typically hundreds of megabytes) is then post processed to provide a high resolution digital terrain map (DTM) with a typical positional resolution of 5-10cm and a depth resolution of 1cm. The DTMs are rendered using in-house seabed visualization software written in the 'C' programming language utilising the OpenGL graphics libraries.</p><p>Sonar technology is not the only method of gathering seabed topography. Underwater photography or video can provide the most detailed view of the seafloor. However, the cameras are limited to short distances as the artificial light does not penetrate the seawater effectively. In some cases visibility can be poor due to disturbed sediment etc. The cameras are usually placed on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) which can be difficult to control and hard to track.</p><p>Satellite technology is another method that can be used to map the seafloor because the shape of the sea surface is closely related to that of the seafloor due to gravity. The depth of the ocean can vary by approximately 200 metres solely from the gravitational pull of large underwater seamounds such as an underwater volcano. Conversely, the ocean surface can downwarp over seabed trenches. Satellites measure the time it takes to bounce radio waves off the surface of the ocean and therefore calculate the height of the sea surface. Ocean topography using satellites can provide a global view of the ocean floor but generally lacks the precision provided by sonar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">CASE STUDIES</head><p>This section considers two examples of seabed visualization: modelling a harbour wall in Holland permitting a 'virtual inspection' of the harbour environment and visualization of a sunken military vessel, the SS Richard Montgomery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Harbour Wall Visualization</head><p>Ijmuiden harbour in Holland is protected by large concrete blocks varying from 1 to 2 metres in dimension. These harbour blocks need to be continually inspected for any damage caused by the strong underwater currents. A visualization tool has been developed at SRD that analyses bathymetric sonar data and provides the user with a real time interactive flyover of a graphical model of the harbour wall. All the computer-modelled blocks are precisely positioned and orientated using the data from the sonar survey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Harbour Model Construction</head><p>The bathymetric data returned from the site survey is provided as input to the harbour wall visualization software. The 3D sonar returns are rendered on screen allowing the block positions to be clearly seen. A semi-automatic program is then used to produce an initial map of the block's positions. However, it is also necessary to calculate the rotation of the blocks, that is their yaw, pitch and roll. This can be achieved by taking advantage of the fact that the blocks themselves are made up of planar faces.</p><p>By simultaneously viewing both the sonar returns and the computer generated blocks, each block can be adjusted so that its face is coincident with the sonar returns. For example, if a computer-generated block is correctly positioned except for its depth, as the user slowly reduces the block's depth, assuming the block is correctly rotated, the sonar returns representing the top face of the block will all be coincident with the computer block face and will disappear simultaneously. If the computer block is raised and the sonar returns disappear in a 'wave' effect then the block's rotation will be incorrect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Harbour Wall Inspection</head><p>When all the blocks have been correctly positioned, the system adds textures, a lighting model and perspective views to increase the realism of the generated model. The sonar returns for the blocks are no longer visually required and are therefore disabled although the returns from the seabed are still rendered to provide the viewer with an indication of the gradient approach to the blocks as can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 2 and 3</ref>. The blocks are texture mapped with pseudo concrete and a lighting model is added to the underwater environment to improve the realism of the harbour model. Notice in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> how some of the blocks have sunk into the seabed. This 40 metre stretch of harbour wall will take the survey vessel approximately 30 seconds for data acquisition. The post processing required to develop the computer model will take a further five minutes.</p><p>The user can then 'fly' around the harbour wall in real-time with full six degrees of freedom. If the user is interested in the attributes of a specific block or group of blocks, moving the mouse pointer over the block and selecting positional information from the main menu will reveal the block's position and orientation. Any of the model attributes can be modified at runtime.</p><p>By surveying the harbour wall annually, it is possible to compare the data from previous years and monitor any block movement. Although a numerical comparison of a change in block attributes would be sufficient to monitor any change in position, a graphical representation showing an animated 'before and after' scenario allowing the viewer to watch the blocks slipping over accelerated time would be an extremely useful visualization tool. The system could also be extended to animate predicted slippage by finding patterns in the data from previous surveys.</p><p>The Seabed Visualization System has been used extensively for investigating and identifying shipwrecks (a much safer alternative to the hazardous nature of wreck diving). Computer visualization of the sonar data will be unaffected by poor visibility or strong tides.</p><p>In August of 1944, the SS Richard Montgomery sailed from America to the UK with a cargo of 7000 tons of munitions. On arrival, this liberty ship was anchored in the Thames Estuary but on the next tide, she dragged her anchor and ran aground on Sheerness Middle Sand. Intensive efforts were made to salvage the cargo but as the ship broke up and flooded, some holds proved to be inaccessible. Remaining on board are 1700 tons of potentially explosive material. The wreck lies in approximately 15 metres of water and remains under continual close observation.</p><p>Surveying the vessel using divers or an ROV has proved to be virtually impossible due to the murky waters and dangerous underwater debris. By surveying the wreck using the Seabed Visualization System, a very accurate computer model has been compiled which contains the exact position and orientation of the ship including a detailed map of the surrounding seabed. A detailed sonar survey of the Montgomery will take approximately half an hour. A survey of the wreck's surrounding seabed requires another four hours covering approximately 200 by 200 metres of seabed. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> shows the wreck's position on the seabed. The vessel has broken into two sections and the surrounding seabed topography is clearly visible. The seabed has been coloured according to depth which can be adjusted or 'scrolled' at run time to highlight seabed scouring or areas of interest.</p><p>By obtaining the original engineering drawings of the Montgomery, a CAD model of the sunken vessel was produced. This model was then carefully overlaid onto the sonar model data set. The results can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>.</p><p>Annual surveys are now undertaken to monitor the wrecks condition and changes in the seabed. The high resolution of the data obtained means that slight changes in the condition of the vessel or the surrounding seabed topography are easily distinguishable.</p><p>Changes in the seabed topography or 'scouring' occurs because the flow of tidal currents over the seabed moves the sand on the seafloor in a continuous abrasive action <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The degree of scouring is determined by the makeup of the seabed. Sheerness Middle Sand, where the Montgomery ran aground is comparatively soft increasing the scouring effect.</p><p>The orientation of any obstacle on the seabed determines the general shape of the scour. Effective scouring prediction for the Montgomery would be extremely useful for calculating the future stability of the wreck. As annual surveys of the Montgomery are carried out, the original survey data and the newly generated computer models of this data can be used as references for any predicted scouring models. The capability to predict the effect of a strong storm upon the wreck's surrounding seabed could prove to be crucial as the rapid shifting of sand might affect the stability of the wreck. Effective visualization and consequent understanding of the way in which obstructions on the seabed affect the tidal flow could be advantageous. For example, in the case of the Montgomery, obstacles may be placed in such a way as to alter the tidal flow so that the wreck becomes more stable or even buried.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSION</head><p>This case study paper has reported on the new and exciting field of seabed visualization. The paper initially described the various methods of acquiring data relating to seabed topography and then introduced the components that make up SRD's Seabed Visualization System. Two seabed visualization case studies were presented: harbour wall inspection and wreck inspection. The system has successfully visualized the vast quantity of numerical data returned from each survey providing the viewer with an informative and powerful management-planning tool.</p><p>Clearly the next step is to provide the user with full interaction with the data as it is collected onboard the survey vessel. Ideally the user will be able to fly around the seabed model in real time. With the seemingly boundless advances in computer science, perhaps it will not be too long before we have the processing power required to perform such a task. All in all, the Seabed Visualization System is a very powerful and unique visualization tool bringing together advanced technologies from both sonar and computer graphics industries.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 -</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Computer modelled harbour blocks (approximately 40 metre stretch) correctly positioned and orientated from the sonar data.</figDesc></figure>
