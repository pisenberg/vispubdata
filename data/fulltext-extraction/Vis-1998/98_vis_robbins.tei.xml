			<abstract>
				<p>This paper discusses techniques for visualizing structure in video data and other data sets that represent time snapshots of physical phenomena. Individual frames of a movie are treated as vectors and projected onto a low-dimensional subspace spanned by principal components. Movies can be compared and their differences visualized by analyzing the nature of the subspace and the projections of multiple movies onto the same subspace. The approach is demonstrated on an application in neurobiology in which the electrical response of a visual cortex to optical stimulation is imaged onto a high-speed photodiode array to produce a cortical movie. Techniques for sampling movies over a single trial and multiple trials are discussed. The approach provides the traditional benefits of principal component analysis (compression, noise reduction and classification) and also allows the visual separation of spatial and temporal behavior.</p>

Video visualizations often incorporate graphical overlays or generate isosurfaces to guide the viewer in understanding the phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Virtual reality techniques allow scientists to interact with visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, but these interactive systems usually require special equipment and extensive setup.</p><p>While the display of video generated from experiments or models is the goal of some visualization work, it is the starting point for understanding structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. When viewing a video, the scientist tries visually to extract physical meaning from moving patterns that may be direct representations of physical quantities or may be visual models such as isosurfaces or streamlines. In looking for fundamental relationships, the viewer tries to understand how the patterns evolve and to compare behavior at different parameters. In all but the simplest cases, it is impossible to quantify how similar two movies are even when they are viewed side by side. Because movies can now be easily disseminated via the World Wide Web, the problem of analyzing and comparing movies of scientific phenomena has become an important visualization problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. This paper adapts an established technique for statistical analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, principal component analysis (PCA), to visualize structure and to compare movies. References to the extensive literature on the application of principal component analysis to data sets of images can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. The problem of finding a good basis for time-varying data sets is sometimes called the blind source separation problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and more general techniques such as independent component analysis (ICA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> can also be used as a starting point for the visualizations. A nice example of using ICA to produce a basis from signals generated by EEG responses of human subjects to auditory events can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. This work emphasizes the visualization of the time behavior of projections of data set images on an appropriate basis. In cases where the approach is applicable, the results allow researchers to organize and compare data across multiple movies. The next section introduces a motivating application in neurobiology and raises some of the questions that might be answered by the comparison technique. Section 3 describes the procedure used in this paper for finding low-dimensional subspaces and illustrates how projections on these subspaces can be used in visualization. Section 4 extends the basic method to compare movies. Section 5 discusses how these techniques can be applied more generally and addresses some limitations. Section 6 provides a summary of the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">MOTIVATION</head><p>The movie analysis methods presented in this paper are illustrated using data from experiments to determine the cortical response to visual stimuli in pond turtles. This animal model was chosen because its relatively flat, unstructured visual cortex is well-suited to high-speed imaging techniques. In addition, the unique turtle diving physiology allows an intact visual system to be used without requiring oxygenation. The visual cortex is stained with voltage sensitive dye <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and the light transmitted through the cortex is imaged onto a 24 × 24 element photodiode array at a rate of up to 1000 frames/second. The translucence of the dyed tissue is directly proportional to electrical activity in the tissue, so the resulting high-speed, low-resolution movie is a direct measurement of cortical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Each trial data set used in this paper consisted of 576 frames acquired at a rate of 353 Hz. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the cortical response recorded during two experimental trials in the same animal using the same diffuse flash stimulus. Selected frames at the same times relative to the stimulus onset (point A) are shown for Trial 3202 (top row) and Trial 3207 (bottom row). The center graphic shows traces from a single photodiode for the trials at the point marked by a white arrow in image E in the bottom row. Notice that while the initial responses appear similar for both trials, Trial 3207 has a sharp secondary spike similar to those that appear during seizure activity.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A B C D E F Trial 3207</formula><p>Trial 3202</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">0.4% 200 msec A B C D E F A B C D E F í í -100% +100% í</formula><p>This series of frames illustrates some of the problems that arise in classifying and comparing videos. How similar are these trials? Does the wave of initial response have the same spatial structure across trials? If a similar spatial structure can be established, is it similar to that seen in other animals or in the same animal for different stimuli? At what point in the response can a difference between the two videos be detected? How can this difference be quantified?</p><p>This paper addresses some of these issues using methods based on finding the right coordinate system in which to view the movies. By right coordinate system, we do not mean the traditional rotation of a three-dimensional view in physical space. Rather, an abstract view is taken: the movie consists of a series of n × m images or frames, where each image represents a vector in a high-dimensional space (of dimension n × m). As the movie plays, the images sweep out a curve in this highdimensional space giving a parametric representation of the movie. We seek a rotation in this high-dimensional space so that the curves defining the movies are confined to a lowdimensional subspace. If such a subspace can be found, a movie can be analyzed by looking at its coordinates in this subspace, and the structure of the subspace itself provides a method of classification. If two movies project to the same lowdimensional subspace, side-by-side comparisons can be made using simple visualization techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">OVERVIEW OF THE TECHNIQUE</head><p>The first step in the visualization process is to find an appropriate coordinate system for viewing the movie. This paper uses principal component analysis, a well-known technique for finding a basis or coordinate system that minimizes the correlation of the data in the transformed coordinate system <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In the movie visualization technique, however, the requirement of optimality is relaxed. Principal component analysis is applied to selected frames in hopes of obtaining a pretty good basis, that is, one in which a few basis vectors capture the significant behavior. Because the calculation may not use the entire data set, there is no guarantee that the correlation will be minimized over the entire data set. Furthermore, comparison techniques may use a basis derived from combining movies or by selecting a representative movie. Principal Components Relative Energy</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>+100% -100%</head><p>Each point in the data set sample is an image extracted from a frame of video. Strategies for selecting a sample are discussed in the next section. The images in the sample are converted to vectors of length N = n × m by writing them in row major form. The new coordinate basis is calculated by solving the eigenvalue problem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">R φ k = λ k φ k for 1 &lt; k &lt; N</formula><p>where R is the expected value of u u T for the collection of data set vectors u. In other words, if the i-th image is u i , then u i u i T is an N×N matrix. The average of these matrices over the collection is R. The eigenvectors of R, also referred to as eigenimages or principal components, are the basis vectors for the new coordinate system. The eigenvalues of R, λ k , measure how much of the data set energy is captured by the corresponding eigenvectors, φ k <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Once a suitable coordinate system has been determined, the entire movie can be reconstructed <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Reconstruction refers to using approximations to the original data set consisting of linear combinations of the components φ 1 , φ 2 … . The j-th order successive reconstruction for the i-th frame of video, u i , is a 1 (i) φ 1 + a 2 (i) φ 2 +…+ a j (i) φ j where a k (i) is the dot product of u i with φ k . That is, a k (i) is the projection of u i on the direction represented by φ k . The eigenvectors φ k are indexed in decreasing order of contribution to overall data set energy. dimensional subspace spanned by φ 1 , φ 2 and φ 3 . The curves swept out by the projections on these components (a 1 , a 2 , and a 3 ) are plotted versus each other in the lower right of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>A reconstructed movie for Trial 3202 using the ten most important components is visually indistinguishable from the original movie. Although component 1 contains 98% of the data set energy, the reconstruction using this single component, a 1 (i)φ 1 , does not reproduce the observed behavior. Component 1 has a single maximum. The projection on this component, a 1 , is always positive, rising from zero and then falling back to zero as the response subsides. The single-component reconstruction resembles a hill that rises and falls, while the original movie gives the visual impression of a wave of activity sweeping from the lower right to upper left. Component 3 appears as a hill and valley combination. The projection on this component, a 3, is negative on the initial rise, placing the hill on the lower right. As time progresses, a 3 reverses sign before returning to zero. As a result, the hill and valley of component 3 are reversed, indicating how the visual appearance of propagation might be achieved. Component 2 captures the negative intrinsic signal at the end of the response. This intrinsic signal is due to the saturation effects of the dye <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Removal of the Mean</head><p>In principal component analysis the data set is often normalized to have zero mean so that the coordinate system origin is centered in the data. Simple geometric arguments can be made that centering usually gives better resolution of data set structure. The vectors representing uncentered data with a large mean are highly correlated, and differences in the individual data points are small compared with the data set mean. When the mean is removed from the data set, however, the vectors representing the individual points are clearly distinguishable.</p><p>For visualization applications, there are sometimes physical arguments why the origin should not be centered. In the biological data, the movie is recorded starting at a fixed time prior to stimulus onset and runs for a fixed duration. The leader and trialer lengths for this movie, corresponding to periods of inactivity, are chosen arbitrarily. Increasing the length of these inactive periods shifts the center of the data toward the origin. To eliminate the influence of trailer length on the results, the average was not removed. Instead, the image corresponding to resting activity at the point of stimulus onset was subtracted from the entire data set.</p><p>When several data sets are combined or a data set is sampled, the selection of an appropriate data set origin is more complex. When data sets do not have zero mean, principle component analysis does not guarantee that the resulting basis minimizes the correlation. Effective visualizations may not require a basis that minimizes the correlation, and in general, the placement of the origin should be based on physical considerations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Implementation for Larger Images</head><p>In video applications, the data sets are digitized video clips of M frames. Each frame is a gray scale image of n × m pixels stored in row major form to produce a vector of size N = n × m. For the biological application discussed in this paper, N = 576 and the principal components can be computed quite quickly. In more typical video applications, the images are larger, and a direct computation of the correlation matrix requires a substantial effort. The direct implementation for a data set of 128 × 128 images produces vectors of length 16,384, and the corresponding autocorrelation matrix has dimensions 16,384 × 16,384. The solution of the eigenvalue problem for such a large matrix is not attractive for visualization.</p><p>When the number of images in the data set (M) is much less than the size of the images (N), the computation can be simplified using the method of snapshots due to Sirovich <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The method of snapshots is based on the observation that the space spanned by M data vectors must be of dimension &lt; M regardless of the length of the vectors. One can convert the problem to a dual problem that involves the solution of an eigenvalue problem of size M × M. When M &lt;&lt; N, the method of snapshots produces the φ k 's considerably faster than a direct computation. A standard technique for finding eigenvectors might take O(N 3 ) operations. The order of the direct computation is O(N 3 + N 2 M), while the order for the method of snapshots is O(M 3 + M 2 N). When M is 100 and N is 16,384, the ratio of number of operations for the direct method to the number of operations for the snapshot method is about 4,000α, where α &gt; 1 is the coefficient in the leading order term of the operation count for solving the eigenvalue problem. The method of snapshots can be applied to 100 images of dimension 128 × 128 in well under a minute on an ordinary workstation, while the direct method takes many hours if it can be done at all.  While the principal component analysis of a single movie is useful, it is difficult to use this analysis to assess differences among movies because each trial is projected onto its own coordinate system. This section discusses methods for combining data sets to find a common coordinate system or global basis for comparing movies. The selection of a sampling method for combining data sets is an empirical process that should be guided by physical considerations. The straightforward method of simply combining all data sets into a single large data set and finding the components may work in many circumstances. However, if one is particularly interested in the details of a certain type of behavior, sampling techniques are more appropriate.</p><p>The general process is described schematically in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. Samples selected from multiple data sets are combined into a single large data set, and principal component analysis is performed. Once a global basis is found, the most important vectors are selected and the original data sets are projected on this collection. The resulting projections are compared in order to quantify the differences between the movies. There is no guarantee that the basis derived from sampling multiple data sets will capture the behavior of the entire data sets. The residual for an image with respect to a collection of vectors is the projection on the complement of the space spanned by the selected vectors.</p><p>In other words, the residual is the portion of the image that is not accounted for in the new coordinate system. One can improve the global basis by incorporating additional vectors that span the space of significant residuals. As an illustration of the technique in the biological application, we created a combined data set of frames selected from eight different trials using a diffuse light stimulus. Each trial consisted of 576 frames, and stimulus onset occurred at frame 50. Frames 50 to 199 were selected from each trial and combined into a single data set. This selection was chosen to capture the initial rise in response for all data sets (corresponding roughly to the interval between frames A and C in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Principal component analysis was applied to obtain a global basis. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure  4</ref> shows a comparison of first three components obtained using this technique with the corresponding components obtained by using all of the frames in each individual trial.   significance. The projection plot in the bottom graph of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> shows how the amplitudes of the projections on component 1 vary between the trials. When the curve follows along the dotted 45° line (as in the initial rise between A and C), the trials behave similarly. The departure of the curves at point D marks the time at which the movies begin to differ significantly in behavior.</p><p>It was interesting to note that the global basis better captured the energy of each entire individual trial than the individual basis for that trial even though the global calculation was based only on the initial rise. In the individual basis calculations, components 2 through 6 clearly contained some experimental noise. The combination of multiple trials (even though the stimulus varied in intensity) reduced the weighting of individual noise components in the correlation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Spectragraphs</head><p>The energy spectrum, E k = λ k / ∑ λ k , is the fraction of the data set energy contained along the direction of the corresponding component. Traditionally, the energy spectrum is used to characterize the relative importance of the individual basis vectors. Although the energy spectrum gives the overall distribution of energy, it may not provide a true picture for systems with irregular temporal behavior. If a few frames contain a significant amount of component φ k but most frames do not, E k will be low, but component φ k may be physically significant.</p><p>Contributions of individual components can be visualized using a spectragraph to plot the square of each projection versus frame number for the data set. The spectragraph can be displayed using a pseudocolored or gray scale image to provide a visual picture of how the eigenvectors contribute to each frame as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. The graph plots frame number on the horizontal axis versus energy contained along a specified component direction on the vertical axis. The last row contains the residual, the amount of energy not accounted for by the basis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trial 3207</head><p>The two spectragraphs in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> were calculated by projecting Trials 3202 and 3207 on the global basis as previously described. Each entry in the spectragraph is divided by the maximum energy in the graph. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> uses a continuous gray scale mapping with black indicating the maximum energy and white indicating less than 1% of the maximum. Recall that only frames 50 to 199 were used to determine the basis. There is surprisingly little residual in frames 200 to 576, even though they were not used in the basis calculation. The most interesting result to come out of the analysis was the observation that the second spike in Trial 3207 was dominated by the first component and thus had the same spatial structure as the original rise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>Visualization of video using projections on principal components is a reasonably inexpensive technique for analyzing structure and comparing multiple videos. An explanation of why the method appears to work well for many systems dates back to its origin. Principal component analysis was originally introduced as a technique for finding an optimal sum-ofproducts approximation ∑ k a k (t)φ k (x) for measurable functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. When principal component analysis is applied to data sets whose underlying behavior is separable, the a k (i)'s give the time evolution of fixed spatial components. Furthermore the resulting components reflect underlying system symmetries and can be used to reason about allowed bifurcations of system behavior as parameters are varied <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Principal component techniques have been applied to medical data for many years with mixed results <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The visualization techniques described in this paper are not directly applicable to data sets that have a large number of significant components or that have the dominant component(s) consisting of noise rather than important structure.</p><p>The computation of global bases for comparison of movies is only applicable when individual images within the movies are spatially registered. In the neurobiological application, all movies acquired for the same preparation were spatially registered. Registration across preparations is difficult because of different brain sizes and variance in topology across animals. Registration is a difficult issue in many medical applications, but it is not a problem in numerical applications or in experimental applications with well-defined geometry. An example of the latter is pattern formation on a circular burner in a combustion experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. These techniques have been successfully applied to the flat flame front, because the underlying system depends on two spatial variables and the light intensity is directly proportional to the temperature, a dynamic variable of the system. Long movies of 64 × 64 and 128 × 128 pixel images were analyzed using the method of snapshots. Movies of the original data and the derived visualizations can be viewed at http://vip.cs.utsa.edu/flames/klvisual/klvisual.html.</p><p>Another caveat in applying this technique relates to the sampling. Robbins <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> has shown that the data (in this case images) must reflect the actual spatial dimension of the system in order for the eigenvectors to be identifiable with normal modes. When principal component analysis was applied to onedimensional cross-sections of a movie of a two-dimensional, quasi-periodic system, the resulting time behavior was not quasi-periodic and the one-dimensional components were not cross-sections of the two-dimensional components. Since video data is intrinsically two-dimensional, this technique can only accurately resolve systems with two spatial dimensions from video data unless stereoscopic information or slice information is used to reconstruct a third spatial dimension. Makeig et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> showed that independent components computed from scalp EEG measurements agreed with results from signals recorded directly from the cortex in human patients provided the signals were statistically independent in time, but the computations did not agree otherwise. Independence in time is not an issue for signals from the turtle cortex or combustion experiments because of the intrinsic two-dimensional nature of these systems. While spatial dimensionality problems are often an issue for experimental measurements, data sets generated from numerical simulations usually have the correct spatial resolution and sufficient temporal resolution, and these techniques can be applied directly to time snapshots of numerical output.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>The techniques described in this paper are based on projections of movies onto low-dimensional subspaces. These techniques work particularly well for low-dimensional systems and highdimensional systems close to onset, where the number of significant components is not too large. Principal component analysis is applied to a sample of images from a movie or collection of movies. The projections onto the resulting components are then visualized using reconstructions, phase plane plots and spectragraphs. If the low-dimensional projections capture a significant proportion of data set energy, the similarity of a collection of movies can be ascertained. A key to successful application is the selection of the samples based on appropriate physical considerations. In the neurobiological application discussed in this paper, it was found that a low-dimensional basis formed by combining multiple trials gave a better representation of each data set than the basis computed directly. A comparison of projections on this global basis across trials enabled researchers to quantify differences in response. The technique also allows researchers to follow transitions in response as system parameters are varied. The surprising success of the technique can be attributed to the observation that a time varying superposition of a few fixed independent spatial patterns can result in a visual appearance that seems unstructured and chaotic. While the human eye cannot pick out the underlying correlation, principal component analysis can.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 A</head><label>1</label><figDesc>comparison of cortical response from two trials using a diffuse light flash stimulus.
