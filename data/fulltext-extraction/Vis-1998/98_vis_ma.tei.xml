				<p>Sediments in many parts of the New York and New Jersey estuary system are contaminated with toxic organic and inorganic compounds by di erent sources. Because of the potential environmental consequences, detailed information on the spatial distribution of sediment contaminants is essential in order to carry out routine shipping channel dredging in an environmentally responsible way, and to remediate hot spots cost-e ectively and safely. Scienti c visualization and scatter data modeling techniques have been successfully applied in analyzing the sparse sampling data of sediment c o n taminants in New York and New Jersey estuaries, the underlying spatial characteristics of which are otherwise di cult to comprehend.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Parts of the New York and New Jersey estuary system contain some of the most polluted sediments in the waterways of the United States 4,9 . Because of the potential environmental consequences, great care must be exercised in regard to any actions involving excavation of these contaminated sediments, such as periodical dredging of the shipping channels to keep them open for navigation, or dredging related to contaminant r emediation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the outline of the estuaries in the region of concern. Historical sediment core sampling locations in this region are scattered e.g., those in Jamaica Bay shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. It is very di cult to obtain a general view of the contaminant distribution <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Sediment core sampling locations in Jamaica Bay, NY. by just looking at the data itself, no matter if it is in tables or in scatter plots. Scienti c data visualization and modeling are essential in order to provide the management and the engineers with detailed information on the distributions of the contaminated sediments so that dredging can be carried out safely and cost-e ciently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">SCATTERED DATA MODELING</head><p>The most simple and straightforward way of displaying scattered data is to list them in a table, or place them on a scatter plot. The drawback of this kind of straightforward discrete presentations is that they fail to convey important information about the spatial characteristics represented by the data. Data modeling is necessary in order to produce quality presentations which impart this information. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> illustrates the function of a data model.</p><p>Among the traditional data modeling methods, the inverse distanced weighted approximation is a relatively simple and computationally inexpensive approach t o i n terpolate scattered data. The major drawback which signi cantly a ects the quality of the output of an data interpolator rooted in this method is that it ignores any local shape properties implied by the data 8 .</p><p>Historical sediment core sampling data in the New York and New Jersey estuaries are poorly conditioned for data modeling. The sampling locations are sparse and irregularly distributed. Moreover, in narrow estuaries e.g., Passaic River, NJ, the aspect ratio between the scale of sampling interval in the cross-channel direction and that in the along-channel direction is huge. These conditions are likely to result in a failure of a commercially available data interpolator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scattered Data Model</head><p>Virtual Grid Scattered Data <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Mapping scattered data onto a virtual grid through a data model. The scattered data modeling technique used in the present w ork is based on a spectral domain decomposition numerical method. In recent y ears, the spectral domain decomposition method has been successfully applied in high-resolution geophysical uid dynamics models 3,5,6,7 . The superior computational properties of this method, such as geometrical exibility, high convergence rate, and suitability for parallel computing, make it a good choice for data modeling as well. The principles of this method can be described as follows:</p><p>Let the geometrical domain of interest be decomposed into K subdomains, e , e=1,2,....,K; S K e=1 e = . Each subdomain, e , contains a numberof data points. The local approximation of the distribution function, u e , in subdomain e can be written as u e x = X u e n e n x where e n n=0,1,2,... are piecewise Chebyshev polynomials 1 , is the spatial variable in the phase domain.</p><p>The global approximation of the distribution function is then taken the following form</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ux = K e=1 u e h x</formula><p>In order to ensure continuity, proper boundary conditions have to be assigned at the interfaces of the subdomains. Depending on the degree of smoothness required, C 0 continuous at the 0 th order and or C 1 continuous at the 1 st order interface continuity conditions have t o be imposed:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">u , = u , u 0 , = u 0 ,</formula><p>where , is the interface between subdomains and .</p><p>To further smooth the output of the spectral multi-domain interpolant, a low-pass lter is applied to remove noises which result from the irregularities of the data. Computational details regarding the spectral domain-decomposition data modeling methodology are described in 7 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">VISUALIZATION RESULTS</head><p>After the spectral domain-decomposition data model poured the scattered sediment core sampling data onto a virtual grid, the rest of data visualization task was carried out by using the IBM Data Explorer DX visual programming tool 2 . Images with detailed information on the spatial distribution of sediment contaminants in the estuaries of concern were thus created. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> is the result of using three dimensional continuous realization technique to show dioxin hot spots" in Passaic River, NJ. In this visualization example, the three dimensional image can befreely rotated to any desired angle on the y to allow examination of the scope of the infected region with the prede ned contamination level hot spot. This visualization technique can provide necessary aid to the formation of a well informed plan for remediation and or dredging of the contaminated sediments. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> is a three dimensional contour plot of the concentration of P C B i n P assaic River. The horizontal coordinates in these gures are New Jersey State Plane coordinates, and the vertical coordinate is in feet. Because the discrepancy between the scale of the horizontal dimension of the Passaic River and that of the vertical dimension, the visual object the Passaic River in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> was stretched in the vertical direction to 700 times its real length in order to show the contaminant distribution pattern in the vertical direction. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows that there are large areas in the Passaic River where the sediment PCB concentration level can be as high as 10 ug kg or more, which far exceeds EPA's standard. By applying the slicing" functionality of the DX programming tool, we can easily view contaminant distribution along any transections of the study region. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> reveals the structure of a dioxin hot spot in a transection taken in the cross-river direction Passaic River. It indicates that the highest dioxin discharge rate at this particular location occurred during a time period in the past, since the core of the hot spot is a couple of feet below the sediment surface. Remediation steps must be taken to protect the environment should any dredging actions take place which a r e necessary in order to keep the navigation channel open.</p><p>Sediment c o n taminant concentration images were also made for Jamaica Bay, N e w ark Bay, and New York Harbor <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 7, 8, 9</ref>. Our visualization results show that despite the fact that the pollution situation has improved somewhat in recent years, the sediment contaminant levels in many parts of the New York and New Jersey estuaries are still very high. We nd that color images of continuous realization work better in revealing hot spots in narrow estuaries than discrete contour lines Figures 7 and 10.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>Scienti c visualization and data modeling are useful tools in analyzing the scattered data of sediment c o n taminants in New York and New Jersey estuaries, the underlying spatial characteristics of which are otherwise di cult to comprehend. The images of the sediment contaminant distribution in three spatial dimensions allow us to obtain detailed information about the scope and distribution pattern of a particular pollutant.</p><p>The density of data locations as well as the manner in which the data locations distribute can <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>. Contour map of Total DDT sur cial sediment concentration in Jamaica Bay, NY. signi cantly a ect the quality of the data model output and, therefore, that of the visualization products. In order to improve the accuracy of the data model output for the sediment contaminant distributions in the New York New Jersey Harbor system, we need to increase the overall sediment core sampling density in the entire region, which currently is very sparse.</p><p>We are planning to develop a 4D time+space simulation and visualization model for the sediment transport process. This model, together with the scattered data model, can serve a s p o werful tools to systematically monitor the environmental conditions of our waterways, as well as to predict future changes of such conditions.  </p></div>
