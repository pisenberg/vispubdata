				<p>The anterior surface of the eye (&apos;cornea&apos;) is extremely important for good sight. Instruments measuring corneal shape conventionally visualize the surface characteristics by mapping the instantaneous radius of curvature onto a rainbow colour scale. This technique is known to have important drawbacks. Firstly, not corneal shape itself is visualized, but rather second order surface properties. Secondly, the type of colouring produces well documented artifacts. In this paper we discuss visualization techniques for a more direct representation of the data. In a three-part display shape deviations are presented as a height surface in one window, height lines superimposed over the input image in another, and a colourmapped representation of the mean normal radius of curvature in a third. With the aid of some typical examples it is shown that these visualizations are easy to interpret by the physician and overcome the limitations of the conventional techniques.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The anterior surface of the eye ('cornea') is responsible for approximately 80% of the refraction, and thus of eminent importance for good sight. The role of the cornea in the refraction process is well recognized by ophthalmologists. For instance, in a typical corneal disease such as keratoconus, a small deformation of the cornea strongly reduces a person's ability to see. This condition results from a mere elevation of only a few µm on the normal surface which approximates an ellipsoid with axes on the order of 8 mm. To diagnose such pathology the physician is interested both in global and local shape features of the cornea. Relevant clinical information on the global shape is in the parameters of the best ellipsoid approximation of the eye (e.g. the lengths of the main ellipsoid axes). An example of local shape feature is the presence of local protrusions. Traditional instruments measuring corneal shape aim at rapid response times, which is vital for clinical applications. Rather than reconstructing the actual surface, the cornea is modelled through an indirect surface property called the radius of instantaneous curvature <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The latter quantity is defined in each surface position as the local radius of normal curvature in the flat surface intersecting the main axis of the instrument (compare with <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). It is well known that instantaneous radius of curvature can be obtained through a fast, but approximate lookup operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Visualization of corneal shape is commonly achieved by mapping the scalar attribute in an array of surface points onto the 'rainbow' colour scale (much in the same way as in Color plate 2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The ophthalmologist has to make a mental transformation to actual geometrical shape. This process is facilitated by the associative value of the colour information.</p><p>The described method has some well known drawbacks. A first limitation comes with the indirectness of the radii of curvature. Although specific corneal shapes are associated with certain colour  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: To measure the shape of the shape of the cornea, a light pattern ('stimulus') is mirrored to the eye and registered with a CCD camera. The left side of the figure shows a crosscut of the instrument developed by us. A pattern in the cylinder is brightly lid from the back by neon tubes. The reflection to the cornea is shown on the right side. Corneal topography is determined from the distortions in the image. patterns, in general the human brain cannot reconstruct shape itself from the indirect representation of changing radii of curvature <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Further restrictions are associated with the type of colour scale, which seems intuitive, but produces well known artifacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>We have developed a new technique in which a light pattern encoding a pseudo random binary array is mirrored to the eye (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The nature of our stimulus pattern allows a unique correspondence of positions at the stimulator and at the CCD. The great benefit of our method is that analysis of the recorded reflection allows for full, 3D reconstruction of the corneal surface while maintaining real time performance. To model corneal surface shape we use a biquintic tensor B-spline defined with uniformous knot spacing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Its parameters are estimated as follows ( <ref type="figure">Figure  3</ref>). Suppose a position s i is reflected of the cornea and registered in a position c i at the CCD. Given a an instance of our model it is possible to calculate a point s i ' on the stimulator that would also be registered in c i when mirrored to the model. This can be done by simple backward rayracing. The approach that we pursue regarding the parameter estimation is to minimize the squared distance between s i and s i ' through a non linear regression technique (see for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>).</p><p>Enabled by the 3D reconstruction of corneal shape, we investigated the possibilities for a direct presentation of the data. In the next sections we will describe our strategy towards the fulfilment of our objective. First, in Section 2, we will describe the methods that we have introduced. In Section 3 some typical examples are shown and finally in Section 4 we will summarize our most prominent conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHOD</head><p>The routines devised by us to model corneal surface shape output an array of 3D positions on our surface model. From this dataset we are primarily interested in the following information aspects (which were earlier identified at the start of the previously sec-tion):</p><p>• global shape (in terms of the best fitting ellipsoid)</p><p>• local deviations (from the global shape)</p><p>A conventional technique to visualize a scalar dataset is through some surface rendering. Scaling and shading at oblique angles are commonly applied to reveal the local structure of such data. Upon application to our problem domain, however, these techniques yield the visualization of a smooth ellipsoid shape. This is because even with severe pathology variations in surface shape are extremely small and smoothly connected to the normal part of the cornea. Thus, more sophisticated techniques are needed specifically for the visualization of local surface features.</p><p>To get a quantitative indication of global corneal shape an ellipsoid is fitted to our dataset by non linearly minimizing the squared distances between the data points and the ellipsoid <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The lengths of the main axes of this ellipsoid immediately measure global corneal shape. However, because ophthalmologists are used to judging shape via the instantaneous radius of curvature, alterna- tively the principal apical normal curvatures can be used. As the outcome of the latter technique merely presents numerical data, we will not describe any further results. For a comprehensive evaluation we refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Local surface structure features are visualized by taking the difference between positions on the model and the best fitting ellipsoid. We have found that, specifically with pathology, surface features are better distinguishable as the fitted ellipsoid runs closely to the peripheral corneal surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. To achieve this, the data points are weighted by a quadratic function of their distance to the centre. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> (left image) an example is shown for a bispherical test object containing smaller radii of curvature in the centre than in the periphery. Clearly, the latter shape contains a protrusion in the central area.</p><p>In addition to the previous aspects, we have found it useful to represent the radius of curvature characteristics in a user interface to support the acceptance of a new visualization method. Moreover, a correspondence of local surface features and the input image appeared indispensable to allow evaluation of their relative position.</p><p>The radius of curvature properties are visualized by mapping the mean normal radius of curvature onto colour as suggested in [1] 1 . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>, bottom right shows the mean curvature of the bisphere which is mapped onto the conventional rainbow colour scale. The middle part obviously contains smaller radius of curvature than the periphery.</p><p>A reference to the input image is made by overlaying the latter with the height lines from either of the previous representations. In this way a correspondence can be made between local shape features and positions in the recorded image of the eye. As before, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> (top right) shows the result with the test object.</p><p>Each of the previous representations can be enhanced by colouring the data in some way. To this end the user may choose from several colour maps such as the standard rainbow colouring, a monochrome colour map and a perceptually linear colour scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>For rapid prototyping of visualization techniques we have cho- </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">EXAMPLES</head><p>To evaluate the usability of the visualization techniques we selected some typical examples. Let us focus on the representation of local surface features. Color plate 1 shows four examples: a perfect sphere (A), a normal eye (B) and two keratoconus eyes (C,D). All presentations are drawn at the same height scale, so that the deviations are mutually comparable. The colour scales, however, run from the maximum to the minimum in the data. Image A (the sphere) shows extremely small elevations (on the order of 0.1 mm) which result from small measurement errors. Much in the same way only minor deviations are observed with the normal eye (B). The protrusions of the keratoconus cases (C,D) are clearly visualized in a natural, intuitive way. The correctness of the latter representations (C,D) can be checked by comparison to the images in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>. Here the input images are overlaid with isoheight lines of the presentations in Color plate 1. In those areas where the pattern becomes denser, one comes across lower radius of curvature (which is symptomatic for a protrusion). This aspect is further characterized by the distance between the height lines, which run closer to one another as the deformation becomes more severe. The enhancement of colouring a representation can be illustrated with the aid of Color plate 2. In this figure we have coloured the mean radius of curvature in surface positions of the two keratoconus eyes (Color plate 1 C,D) with a rainbow as well as a percep- tually linear colour scale. The maximum and minimum radius of curvature values were taken from the scale which has become the standard in ophthalmology <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>In the 'rainbow images' (top) the data values obviously appear grouped in sharply delineated areas. Additionally, each of these areas appears rather monochromatically. With the linear colour scale, however, the previously noticed sudden transitions disappear. Moreover, all sorts of small fluctuations in the data values become visible.</p><p>Thus, using a rainbow colour scale for colouring curvature data may lead to misinterpretation of corneal shape. A perceptually linear colour scheme overcomes inherent artefacts of the rainbow scale. A remaining drawback of representing curvature data, however, comes with the obligatory transformation of second derivative information to actual corneal surface shape. A promising alternative is offered by our ellipsoid fitting approach yielding a more intuitive, direct representation of the shape of the cornea.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Conventional instruments in cornea topography visualize surface shape by mapping second order surface characteristics onto a rainbow colour scheme. In this article we have described new visualization techniques to support real time visualization of the corneal surface itself. Surface features can be visualized directly, in an intuitive way through the differences between modelled surface shape and the best fitting ellipsoid. To enhance the acceptance by the physician, a representation of the radius of curvature is useful. However, we demonstrated that relevant information may not be distinguished if a rainbow colouring is applied to this data. A correspondence of features in the data and the patient's eye is attained by overlaying the input image with isoheight lines derived from either of the former representations.</p><p>In conclusion, the visualization techniques introduced by us overcome the limitations of conventional techniques and are easy to interpret by the physician. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 :Figure 3 :</head><label>23</label><figDesc>Example of the main visualization items. The left image displays the deviations of a measured shape from the best fitting ellipsoid. The top right image shows the input image overlaid with height lines taken from the previous representation. In the bottom right image the mean radius of curvature of curvature of the surface model is mapped on the standard, rainbow colour scale. Suppose that a position s i is mirrored to the cornea and registered in a position c i at the CCD. Given a surface model, one can calculate a position s i ' at the stimulator that is also registered in c i . The model parameters are estimated by minimizing the distance between s i and s i '.</figDesc></figure>
