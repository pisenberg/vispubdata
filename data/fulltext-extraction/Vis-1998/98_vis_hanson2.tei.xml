<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>We propose a general framework for selecting optimal systems of coordinate frames that can be applied to visualizing geometric structures such as curves and surfaces in three-dimensional space. The methods contain "minimal-turning" parallel-transport framings of curves as a special case, are independent of parameterization, and extend naturally to situations where parallel transport is not applicable.</p><p>Motivation. Many visualization problems require techniques for effectively displaying the properties of curves and surfaces. The problem of finding appropriate representations can be quite challenging. Representations of space curves based on single lines are often inadequate for graphics purposes; significantly better images result from choosing a "tubing" to display the curve as a graphics object with spatial extent. Vanishing curvature invalidates methods such as the Frenet frame, and alternative approaches to tubing involve heuristics unrelated to parameterization-invariant optimization measures in order to achieve such properties as periodicity. Similar problems occur in the construction of suitable visualizations of complex surfaces and oriented particle systems on surfaces, since the intrinsic orientation properties may be poorly exposed by the original representation. If a surface patch is represented by a rectangular but nonorthogonal mesh, for example, there is no obvious way to choose among alternative local orthonormal frame assignments; if the surface has regions of vanishing curvature, methods based on directions of principal curvatures break down as well.  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: (a) A smooth 3D surface patch having a non-orthogonal parameterization, along with its geometrically-fixed normals at the four corners. No unique orthonormal frame is derivable from the parameterization. If we imitate parallel transport for curves to evolve the initial frame at the top corner to choose the frame at the bottom corner, we find that paths (b) and (c) result in incompatible final frames at the bottom corner. This paper addresses the problem of systematically choosing a compatible set of surface frames in situations like this.</p><p>While we emphasize curves and surfaces in this paper to provide intuitive examples, there are several parallel problem domains that can be addressed with identical techniques. Among these are extrusion methods and generalized cones in geometric modeling, the imposition of constraints on a camera-frame axis in key-frame animation, and the selection of a 2D array of camera-frame axis choices as a condition on a constrained-navigation environment (see, e.g., Hanson and Wernert <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> summarizes the basic class of problems involving curves that will concern us here. The line drawing (a) of a <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref> torus knot provides no useful information about the 3D structure. Improving the visualization by creating a tubing involves a subtle dilemma that we attempt to expose in the rest of the figure. We cannot use a periodic Frenet frame as a basis for this tubing because inflection points or near-inflection points occur for many nice-looking torus knot parameterizations, and in such cases the Frenet frame is undefined or twists wildly. The parallel-transport tubing shown in (b) is well-behaved but not periodic; by looking carefully at the magnified portion next to the arrow in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>(c), one can see a gross mismatch in the tessellation due to the nonperiodicity. While it would be possible in many applications to ignore this mismatch, it has been the subject of a wide variety of previous papers (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>), and must obviously be repaired for many other applications such as those requiring textured periodic tubes. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> illustrates a corresponding problem for surface patches. While the normals to the four corners of the patch are always welldefined (a), one finds two different frames for the bottom corner depending upon whether one parallel transports the initial frame around the left-hand path (b) or the right-hand path (c). There is no immediately obvious right way to choose a family of frames covering this surface patch.</p><p>Our goal is to propose a systematic family of optimization methods for resolving problems such as these.</p><p>Methodology. We focus on unit quaternion representations of coordinate frames because of the well-known natural structure of unit quaternions as points on the three-sphere S 3 , which admits a natural distance measure for defining optimization problems, and supports in addition a variety of regular frame-interpolation methods (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>). We do not address the related question of optimal freely moving frames treated by the minimaltangential-acceleration methods (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>); we are instead concerned with closely-spaced points on curves and surfaces where one direction of the frame is already fixed, and the chosen functional minimization in quaternion space must obey the additional constraint imposed by the fixed family of directions. Additional references of interest, especially regarding the treatment of surfaces, include <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> provides a visualization of the difference between the general interpolation problem and our constrained problem: a typical spline minimizes the bending energy specified by the chosen anchor points; requiring intermediate points to slide on constrained paths during the minimization modifies the problem. In particular, 3D spline curves need not intersect any of the constraint paths. In addition, we note that we typically have already sampled our curves and surfaces as finely as we need, so that piecewise linear splines are generally sufficient for the applications we discuss.</p><p>Our solution to the problem is to transform the intrinsic geometric quantities such as the tangent field of a curve and the normal field of a surface to quaternion space and to construct the quaternion manifold corresponding to the one remaining degree of rotational freedom in the choice of coordinate frame at each point. Paths in this space of possible frames correspond to specific choices of the quaternion Gauss map, a subspace of the space of possible quaternion frames of the object to be visualized. Mathematically speaking, the space of possible frames is the circular Hopf fiber lying above the point in S 2 corresponding to each specific curve tangent or surface normal (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>).</p><p>Parallel Transport and Minimal Measure. Constraining each quaternion point (a frame) to its own circular quaternion path (the axial degree of rotational freedom), we then minimize the quaternion length of the frame assignment for curves and the quaternion area of the frame assignment for surfaces to achieve an optimal frame choice; this choice reduces to the parallel-transport frame for simple cases. Our justification for choosing minimal quaternion length for curves is that there is a unique rotation in the plane of two neighboring tangents that takes each tangent direction to its next neighbor along a curve: this is the geodesic arc connecting the two frames in quaternion space, and is therefore the minimum distance between the quaternion points representing the two frames. The choice of minimal area for surface frames is more heuristic, basically a plausibility argument that the generalization of minimal length is minimal area; no doubt this could be made more rigorous.</p><p>By imposing other criteria such as endpoint derivative values and In this paper, our sample points are generally close enough together that we apply the constraints to piecewise linear splines analogous to those shown here. minimal bending energy (see Barr et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>), the short straight line segments and polygons that result from the simplest minimization could be smoothed to become generalized splines passing through the required constraint rings; since, in practice, our curve and surface samplings are arbitrarily dense, this was not pursued in the current investigation. For space curves, specifying a frame assignment as a quaternion path leads at once to tubular surfaces that provide a "thickened" representation of the curve that interacts well with texturing, lighting, and rendering models. For surface patches, the approach results in a structure equivalent to that of an anisotropic oriented particle system (also a species of texture) whose pairs of tangent vector fields in the surface produce natural flow fields that characterize the local surface properties and are easy to display.</p><p>Background. General questions involving the specification of curve framings have been investigated in many contexts; for a representative selection of approaches, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. The quaternion Gauss map is a logical extension of the quaternion frame approach to visualizing space curves introduced by Hanson and Ma <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. For basic information on orientation spaces and their relationship to quaternions, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19]</ref>.</p><p>Background on the differential geometry of curves and surfaces may be found in sources such as the classical treatise of Eisenhart <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and in Gray's MATHEMATICA-based text <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, which inspired a number of the illustrations in this paper. The classical Frenet frame is defined and studied in these texts. The frame we refer to as the parallel-transport frame was first described carefully by Bishop <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and has been commonly used in graphics (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17]</ref>). A significant difference between these two methods is that the Frenet frame is locally defined but possibly discontinuous, whereas the parallel-transport frame is continuous but non-local, corresponding to the solution of a differential equation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Space of Frames</head><p>We begin by introducing the key concept of the space of possible frames.</p><p>Suppose at each sample point xt of a curve, we are given a unit tangent vector,Tt, computed by whatever method one likes (two-point sampling, five-point sampling, analytic, etc.). Then one can immediately write down a one-parameter family describing all possible choices of the normal plane orientation: it is just the set of rotation matrices R;Tt (or quaternions q;Tt) that leavê We now define f;v = f0; f 1; f 2; f 3 to be a quaternion describing the family of frames for which the directionv is a preferred fixed axis of the frame, such as the tangent or normal vectors. The orthonormal triad of 3-vectors describing the desired frame is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F;v = " f 2 0 +f 2 1 ,f 2 2 ,f 2 3 2f1f2 , 2f0f3 2f1f3 + 2 f0f2 2f1f2 + 2 f0f3 f 2 0 ,f 2 1 +f 2 2 ,f 2 3 2f2f3 , 2f0f1 2f1f3 , 2f0f2 2f2f3 + 2 f0f1 f 2 0 ,f 2 1 ,f 2 2 +f 2 3</formula><p>;</p><p>(1)</p><p>where one column, typically the 3rd column, must bev.</p><p>The standard rotation matrix R;v leavesv fixed but does not havev as one column of the 3 3 rotation matrix, and so we have more work to do. To compute f;v, we need the following:</p><p>A base reference frame bv that is guaranteed to have, say, the 3rd column exactly aligned with a chosen vectorv, which is either the tangent to a curve or the normal to a surface.</p><p>A one-parameter family of rotations that leaves a fixed directionv invariant.</p><p>The latter family of rotations is given simply by the standard quaternion</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">q;v = c o s 2 ;v sin 2 ;<label>(2)</label></formula><p>for 0 4, while the base frame can be chosen as bv = qarccosẑ v; ẑ v=kẑ vk :</p><p>We refer hereafter to the frame bv as the Geodesic Reference Frame because it tilts the reference vectorẑ along a geodesic arc until it is aligned withv; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. Ifv =ẑ, there is no problem, since we just take bv to be the quaternion 1; 0; ifv = ,ẑ, we may choose any compatible quaternion such as 0; 1; 0; 0. We escape the classic difficulty of being unable to assign a global frame to all of S 2 because we need a parameterization of all possible frames, not any one particular global frame. If one wants to use a reference frame that is not the identity frame, one must premultiply bv on the right by a quaternion rotating from the identity into that reference frame; this is important when constructing a nonstandard Geodesic Reference Frame such as that required to smoothly describe a neighborhood of the southern hemisphere of S 2 . We can thus write the full family of possible quaternion frames keepingv as a fixed element of the frame triad to be the quaternion product f;v = q;v bv ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> where denotes quaternion multiplication and all possible frames are described twice since 0 4. To summarize, if we specify a frame axisv to be fixed, then the variable in f;v serves to parameterize a ring in quaternion space, each point of which corresponds to a particular 3D frame, and each frame has a diametrically opposite twin.</p><p>Surface Patch Example. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> shows how the frame choice problem of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> can be visualized in the quaternion space of frames. We choose a quaternion projection that shows only the 3-vector part of the quaternion, dropping q0. A frame choice is achieved by moving a point around the sliding ring constraint defined by Eq. (4) to the desired position. The constraint rings in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> are the generalizations to quaternion space of the constraint lines symbolized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3(b)</ref>. The vertex A admits a family of frames f;ẑ that is a circle in quaternion space, but projects "edge-on" to a vertical bar in our default projection. The spaces of frames at the other vertices project as ellipses. The outer ring in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>(b) is touched by two paths, corresponding to the clockwise and counterclockwise parallel transport routes in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure  5(a)</ref>; the gap between the intercepts in the outer ring corresponds to the inequivalence of the two frames at the bottom vertex of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure  5</ref>(a).</p><p>Closed Curve Example. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>, we show a simple closed curve, the trefoil knot, the quaternion plot of its periodic Frenet frame, and, just to show we can do it, the entire constraint surface in which the Frenet frame and all other possible quaternion framings of the trefoil must lie. In the next section, we show the results of optimizing a continuous family of frames lying within this remarkable surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Minimal Frames</head><p>We have computed a wide selection of examples using the Evolver of K. Brakke <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> as our optimization tool. The Evolver is a public-domain, extensively documented system with a huge range of constraint-solving capabilities, widely used in mathematics and certain engineering problems. It has a very simple interface for handling parametric constraints like our sliding ring constraints, and can also handle a wide variety of energy functionals and boundary specifications. Most of the examples shown here take only a few seconds to stabilize in the Evolver; more complex geometries will of course take longer.</p><p>Two enhancements to the Evolver handle the specific issues related to quaternion optimization; the symmetry specification symmetry_group "central_symmetry" identifies the quaternion q with ,q if desired during the variation to prevent reflected double traversals from varying independently, and the system is able to use the pullback metric on the sphere</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ds 2 = X i;j dxi dxj r ,4 r 2 i;j , xi xj</formula><p>to compute distances directly on the quaternion three-sphere. Computation using this metric, however, is very slow, and so in practice we have used the Euclidean R 4 chord approximation, which works quite well for closely spaced samples and is much faster. (There are other choices of three-sphere parameterizations and quaternion distance measures that we have not yet attempted that could be more efficient still.) The energy functional that we chose to specify for the Evolver (or that would be implemented in a dedicated system) is thus simply the sum of the Euclidean lengths of each line segment in R 4 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">d = X i;j jxi , xjj</formula><p>where jqj = p q q = p q0q0 + q1q1 + q2q2 + q3q3. For surface areas, the Evolver breaks polygons into triangles, computes their areas, and minimizes the total sum as the vertex positions vary. Our own use of the Evolver required only changing the parameter "#define BDRYMAX 20" in skeleton.h to the desired (large) value corresponding to the number of desired sliding rings and recompiling.</p><p>Then, remembering to set "space_dimension 4" when working in R 4 , one needs in addition a piece of code similar to the following MATHEMATICA fragment to translate Eq. (4) into the boundary constraints for each fixed vector (tangent or normal) and the chosen initial quaternion reference frame:  We use throughout a quaternion projection that shows only the 3-vector part of the quaternion, dropping q0; this is much like projecting away z in a polar projection of the 2-sphere. Each heavy black curve is a ring of possible frame choices that keep fixed the normals in (a); the labels mark the point in quaternion space corresponding to the frames at the corners in (a), so the gap between the labels C and C'</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Do[ring =</formula><p>represents the frame mismatch in quaternion space on the same constraint ring. (The apparent vertical line is the result of drawing a squashed circle of frames at vertex A in this projection.) (c) The method proposed in this paper to resolve this conflict is to fix one point, say A, divide the polygon ABCB 0 into triangles, and slide B, C, and B 0 along the constraint rings until the total triangle areas are minimized, and some compromise with C = C 0 is reached. Here Qprod and makeQfromVec perform the quaternion product and create the quaternion corresponding to Eq. (4) with P1</p><p>replacing . Note that, since the Evolver displays only the first three coordinates, we have moved the scalar quaternion to the end; then the Evolver will display our preferred projection automatically.</p><p>With these preliminaries, the Evolver can easily be used to minimize the length of the total piecewise linear path among sliding ring constraints for selected curves, and the total area spanned by analogous sliding rings for surfaces. We made no attempt to go beyond piecewise linear curves. One interesting result is that there appear to be families of topologically distinct minima: depending on the conditions imposed, one may find either two disjoint curves (surfaces), one the q ! ,q image of the other, or a single quaternion curve (surface) that contains its own reflection, such as that in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6(b)</ref>. The families of frame manifolds containing their own reflected images have minima distinct from the disjoint families.</p><p>We now present some simple examples to give a feeling for the process.</p><p>Minimal Quaternion Frames for Space Curves. The helix provides a good initial example of the procedure we have formulated. We know that we can always find an initial framing of a curve based on the Geodesic Reference algorithm; however, suppose we wish to impose minimal length in quaternion space on the framing we select, and we do not know whether this frame is optimal with respect to that measure. Then, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure  7</ref>, we can compute the ring constraints on the possible quaternion frames at each sample point and let the Evolver automatically find the optimal framing. The results for several stages of this evolution are shown in the <ref type="figure">Figure;</ref> the final configuration is indistinguishable from the parallel-transport frame, confirming experimentally our theoretical expectation that parallel transport produces the minimal possible twisting.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, we introduced the question of finding an optimal framing of a particular (3,5) torus knot whose almost-optimal parallel-transport framing was not periodic. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref>, we show the solution to this problem achieved by clamping the initial and final quaternion frames to coincide, then letting the Evolver pick the shortest quaternion path for all the other frames.</p><p>The types of solutions we find are essentially the same for all reparameterizations of the curve; regardless of the spacing of the sampling, the continuous surface of possible frames is geometrically the same in quaternion space, so paths that are minimal for one sampling should be approximately identical to paths for any reasonable sampling. On the other hand, if we want special conditions for certain parameter values, it is easy to fix any number of particular orientations at other points on the curve, just as we fixed the starting points above; derivative values and smoothness constraints leading to generalized splines could be similarly specified (see, e.g., Barr et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Surface Patch Framings.</head><p>A classic simple example of a surface patch framing problem was presented in the discussion of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figures 2 and 5</ref>. This problem can also be handled naturally by the Evolver: we choose an initial quaternion frame for the mesh and minimize the area in quaternion space subject to the constraints that the normals remain unchanged. That is, the frame choices may only slide around constraint rings such as those depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>(b) for the frames at the corners. The results are shown in <ref type="figure">Figures 10  and 9</ref>. As a test, we started one case in a random initial state with a range of 2 in the starting values. All converged to the same optimal final framing. While more complex examples could be given, all the essential features of the method short of dealing rigorously with non-trivial topological manifolds are illustrated by this surface patch example. Starting from the Geodesic Reference quaternion frame for a single turn of the helix, the very dark gray circle, the Evolver produces these intermediate steps while minimizing the total quaternion curve length subject to the constraints in the space of frames. The final result is the white curve, which is identical to several decimal points with the parallel transport quaternion frame for the same helix; note that the quaternion length of the white curve is the shortest, even though in this projection that is not obvious. The numerical energies of the four curves, from dark to light in color, are 3.03, 2.91, 2.82, and 2.66 for the Parallel Transport frame. The individual tubings used to display these curves are in fact created using the parallel transport frame for each individual curve.</p><p>Manifolds. For general manifolds, one must treat patches one at a time in any event, since global frames may not exist at all. Although the locally optimal patches cannot be globally joined to one another, we conjecture that some applications might benefit from the next best thing: matching boundary frames of neighboring patches using transitional rotations (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>). We have carried this out explicitly for simple cases, but omit it here for brevity.</p><p>Extensions to Other Domains. We have focussed for expository purposes in this paper on frames with intrinsic natural constraints imposed by the tangents to curves and normals to surfaces. However, the method extends almost trivially to applications involving externally specified constraints on frames. Geometric construction algorithms based on extrusions reduce to the tubing problem. For ordinary camera control interpolation, one could constrain any direction of the camera frame to be fixed by calculating its appropriate constraint ring in the quaternion Gauss map, and then extend a method like that of Barr et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>) to smoothly compute intermediate frames subject to the constraints. For more general constrained navigation methods like those described by Hanson and Wernert <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>), the camera vertical direction could be fixed at chosen points over the entire constraint manifold, and the remaining frame parameters determined by optimization within the manifold of ring constraints, possibly subject to fixing entire key-frames at selected locations or boundaries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>We have introduced a general framework derived from the quaternion Gauss map for studying and selecting appropriate families of coordinate frames for curves and surface patches in 3D space. Minimizing length for quaternion curve maps and area for surfaces is proposed as the appropriate generalization of parallel transport for the selection of optimal frame fields. These smooth frames can be used to generate tubular surfaces based on the space curves, thus allowing their effective display on polygon-based graphics en-gines with texturing. The analogous results for surface patches allow the selection of optimal local coordinate systems that may be adapted for display purposes and related applications such as texturing based on oriented particle systems. Our principal new tool is the space of all possible frames, a manifold of constraints immersed in the space of quaternion frames. By defining energies and boundary conditions in this space one can produce a rich variety of application-adapted criteria for specifying optimal families of frames. Work remaining to be done in the future includes applying the method to other domains such as geometric modeling and viewpoint interpolation, studying more carefully the topologically distinct minimal quaternion area solutions found for certain surface framings, and studying more challenging problems in the surface domain, e.g., topological tori with various numerical bumps and deformations are known to admit global frames, but little is known about how to compute good ones, and this method is a logical candidate.  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> to produce a nearby periodic framing.

For this trefoil knot, the frame does not close on itself in quaternion space unless the curve is traversed twice, corresponding to the double-valued "mirror" image of the rotation space that can occur in the quaternion representation. The longer segments in (b) correspond to the three high-torsion segments observable in (a). (c) The full constraint space for the trefoil knot is a very complex surface swept out by the constraint rings. All quaternions are projected to 3D using only the vector part.</figDesc></figure>

(c) A random starting configuration with the single same fixed corner point as (a) and (b) and a range of , to + relative to the Geodesic Reference frame. (d) The result of minimization of the quaternion area is the same for all starting points. The relative areas are: 0.147, 0.154, 0.296, and 0.141, respectively. Thus the Geodesic Reference is very close to optimal, but is distinct.</figDesc></figure>
