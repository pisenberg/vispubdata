				<p>In a large number of applications, data is collected and referenced by their spatial locations. Visualizing large amounts of spatially referenced data on a limited-size screen display often results in poor visualizations due to the high degree of overplotting of neighboring data points. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to visualizing large amounts of spatially referenced data. The basic idea is to intelligently use the unoccupied pixels of the display instead of overplotting data points. After formally describing the problem, we present two solutions which are based on (1) placing overlapping data points on the nearest unoccupied pixel and (2) shifting data points along a screen-filling curve (e.g., Hilbertcurve). We then develop a more sophisticated approach called Gridfit, which is based on a hierarchical partitioning of the data space. We evaluate all three approaches with respect to their efficiency and effectiveness and show the superiority of the Gridfit approach. For measuring the effectiveness, we not only present the resulting visualizations but also introduce mathematical effectiveness criteria measuring properties of the generated visualizations with respect to the original data such as distance-and position-preservation.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>There a large number of applications where spatially data arises. Examples include weather measurements such as temperature, rainfall, wind-speed, etc. measured at a large number of locations, use of connecting nodes in telephone business, load of a large number of internet nodes at different locations, air pollution of cities with more than 10.000 inhabitants, etc. Visualizing this type of information requires representing the data values (e.g., air pollution) and their spatial location. A natural way to visualize the data would be, for example, to represent the data values as colored pixels on a screen position which directly correlates to the spatial location of the data. Since the spatial locations of the data are not uniformly distributed in a rectangular data space, however, the display will usually be sparsely populated in some regions while in other regions of the display a high degree of overplotting occurs. Consider, for example, the air pollution example from above. The cities with more than 10.000 inhabitants cluster in few places (such as North America, Europe, Asia, etc.) while large portions of the earth are only sparsely inhabited. In addition, if the data is presented on a world map the large portion of the screen which corresponds to oceans is not used, while only a few data values corresponding to European cities may be displayed. This results in a loss of potentially important information.</p><p>A simple but intuitive idea to avoid this problem is to present data values, which can not be presented at the correct position on the screen, at nearby unoccupied positions.</p><p>If the values are presented in an appropriate way, the visualization naturally reflects the spatial location of the data and the loss of information can be avoided. In addition, as many pixels of the display as necessary are used while still reflecting the spatial nature of the data. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, we show a data set of lightning strikes in southern Germany over a period of time. On the left, the data set is presented without overlapping data points, whereas on the right, overlapping data points are placed on unoccupied pixels close to their original position, thereby avoiding the information to be lost. The goal of the this paper is to introduce an efficient visualization algorithm for visualizing spatially referenced data in an effective way.</p><p>The use of visualization technology for the data exploration of large amounts of data has been done by a number of researchers. Examples for visual data exploration approaches include geometric projection techniques such as prosection matrices <ref type="bibr">[</ref> The techniques presented in this paper can be seen as pixel-oriented technique. The principle idea of pixel-oriented techniques is to use each pixel of the display to represent one data value (e.g., spiral [KK 94], recursive pattern [KKA 95], and circle segments techniques [AKK 96]). In contrast to previous pixel-oriented techniques, the techniques presented in this paper deal with displaying spatially referenced data which means that the data have 2D coordinates and some additional data values. The goal of the new techniques is to present the data on the display such that the (absolute and relative) position of the data points and their distance is preserved as much as possible. These objectives can be described formally as global optimization goals of the mapping function between original and new position of the data points (cf. subsection 2.1). In subsection 2.2, we introduce a first algorithm which implements this mapping function by placing all data points to their original position unless the position is already occupied by some other data point. In a second step, all remaining data points are placed on the nearest unoccupied pixel. A second algorithm (cf. subsection 2.2) places the data points which could not be placed in the first step by shifting the data points along a screen-filling curve (e.g., Hilbert-or Z-curve). A third and more sophisticated algorithm, called Gridfit, is based on a hierarchical partitioning the data space into subregions (cf. section 3). The partitioning into subregions is determined such that each region in the hierarchical structure (in our case a variant of the quadtree <ref type="bibr">[Sam 84</ref>]) allows a visualization of the data which belong to the region. An experimental evaluation using several different data sets shows the superior efficiency (cf. subsection 4.1) and effectiveness (with respect to the optimization criterions, cf. subsection 4.2) of the Gridfit approach. A visual comparison (cf. subsection 4.3) confirms these results. In section 5, we finally discuss the different approaches and present an alternative idea which is based on clustering the data for an effective display. First results show that in spite of the high run time of the algorithm the effectiveness is not improved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Problem and Two Solutions</head><p>In this section, we formally describe the problem and present two solutions -the nearest-neighbor and the curvebased algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Formal Description of the Problem</head><p>The problem of visualizing spatially referenced data can be described as a mapping between the multiset of original positions and the set of new positions. Let A be the data set of original positions with where it is possible that for an arbitrary i and j. Let the data space (or better screen space) be defined as where and are the maximal extension of the screen. The goal of the algorithm is to determine a solution set of new positions with being the new position of such that and the resulting visualization should be as similar as possible to the visualization of the original data. The similarity may be defined by the absolute distance of the data points to their original positions or by the relative distance or relative position between data points. This leads to the following optimization goals:</p><p>(1) absolute position-preservation</p><p>(2) relative position-preservation The optimization goals make sure that as little as possible of the spatial information is lost. Which of the three optimization goals is most important and should be fulfilled first depends on the application. The formal description of the problem indicates that finding a mapping which fulfills the above properties is a typical optimization problem. Most typical optimization problems are NP-complete and we assume that our mapping problem also belongs to the class of NP-complete problems. A formal proof, however, has not yet been found.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Two Solutions</head><p>Both algorithms work in two steps. In step one, all data points which have unique position (i.e., ) are placed on the display. In the second step, a new position is determined for the remaining data points, which is as close as possible to their original position. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A a 0 … a N 1 - , , { } = a i a i x a i y , ( ) = a i a j = DS 9 2 ⊆ DS 0 … x max 1 - , , { } 0 … y max 1 - , , { } × = x max y max S s 0 … s N 1 - , , { } = s i a i i j ≠ s i s j ≠ ⇒ i j , 0…N 1 - { } ∈ ∀ d a i s i , ( ) i 0 = N 1 - ∑ min → d s i s j , ( ) d a i a j , ( ) - j 0 = j i ≠ , N 1 - ∑ i 0 = N 1 - ∑ min → d s i s j , ( ) d a i a j , ( ) ------------------- j 0 = j i ≠ , N 1 - ∑ i 0 = N 1 - ∑ min → d a i a j , ( ) a i x a j x - a i y a j y - + = d a i a j , ( ) a i x a j x - ( ) 2 a i y a j y - ( ) 2 + = a i a i a j ≠ a j A ∈ j i ≠ ( ) ∀</formula><p>More formally, the general idea of the algorithm can be described as follows.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nearest-Neighbor Algorithm</head><p>In case of the nearest-neighbor algorithm, the new position for the data points which do not have a unique position and have therefore not been placed in the first step is determined by simply placing the data points on the nearest unoccupied positions (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2a</ref>). More formally, the new position of a data point can be determined as .</p><p>An advantage is that the new position can usually be determined locally and therefore, in general, the algorithm works rather efficiently. For a very dense display, however, the efficiency and effectiveness suffer from the fact that the new position may be rather far from the original position (cf. section 4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Curve-based Algorithm</head><p>In case of the curve-based algorithm, the new position for the data points which do not have a unique position and have therefore not been placed in the first step is determined by computing the nearest unoccupied positions on a given screen-filling curve and shifting all data points between the point overlapping data point a and the unoccupied position in that direction (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2b</ref>). Screen-filling curves such as the Hilbert-curve [Pea 90, Hil 91] or Z-curve [Mor 66] provide a bijective mapping between a position on a one-dimensional line and a two-dimensional position. The advantage is that data points which are close in 1D are usually mapped to nearby points in 2D and vice versa. The idea of the curve-based algorithm is to shift the data points along the screen-filling curve (1D) which in general will also be nearby positions in 2D. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The Gridfit Algorithm</head><p>As a first evaluation showed, neither the nearest-neighbor nor the curve-based algorithm provide visualizations which are as position-and distance-preserving as possible (cf. subsection 4.2). In addition, for a high degree of non-unique data points the performance degenerates (cf. subsection 4.1). We therefore developed a more sophisticated algorithms called Gridfit which provides a better efficiency and effectiveness (visually as well as measured) than the other two algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Basic Idea</head><p>The basic idea of the Gridfit algorithm is to hierarchically partition the data space. In each step, the data set is partitioned into four subsets containing the data points which belong to four equally-sized subregions. Since the data points may not fit into the four equally size subregions we have to determine </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S 0 a 0 { } = T 0 ∅ = S i 1 + S i a i 1 + { } ∪ if a i 1 + s ≠ ( ) S i ∀ S i otherwise      = T i 1 + T i if a i 1 + s ≠ ( ) S i ∀ T i a i 1 + { } ∪ otherwise      = S 0 ' S N 1 - = T 0 ' T N 1 - = T i 1 + ' T i ' a { } for an arbitrary a T i ' ∈ - = S i 1 + ' S i ' a new { } ∪ = a new a new a a new s' DS \ S i ∈ d a s' , ( ) d a s , ( ) s DS \ S i ∈ ∀ ≤ { } = C: 0 … x max y max 1 - ⋅ , , { } DS → H i ( ) a =</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">C 1 -: DS 0 … x max y max 1 - ⋅ , , { } → j j 1 if j 1 j 2 ≤ j 2 otherwise      = ⊕ signum j ( ) = j 1 min j N 0 C C 1 -a ( ) j + ( ) DS \ S i ∈ ∈       = j 2 m -in j N 0 C C 1 -a ( ) j - ( ) DS \ S i ∈ ∈       = C C 1 -a ( ) j + ( ) S i 1 + S i b { } - b' DS ∈ b' C C 1 -b ( ) 1 ⊕ ( ) = { } ∪ = b b DS ∈ C 1 -a ( ) C 1 -b ( ) C 1 -a ( ) j + &lt; &lt; { } ∈ ∀ a new a a new s' DS ∈ s' C C 1 -a ( ) 1 ⊕ ( ) = { } =</formula><p>a new extend of the four subregions (without changing the four subsets of data points) such that the data points of each of the subsets can be visualized in the corresponding subregion. For an efficient implementation of the algorithm, a quadtreelike data structure is used to manage the required information and to support the recursive partitioning process. The partitioning process works as follows. Starting with the root of the quadtree, in each step the data space is partitioned into 4 subregions. The partitioning is made such that the area occupied by each of the subregions (in pixels) is larger than the number of pixels belonging to the corresponding subregion (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Formal Description</head><p>The quadtree data structure consists of a root node , which is the starting point for the hierarchical arrangement of nodes, and each non-leaf node of the quadtree has four son nodes. Let denote a node on hierarchy level i, denote the extend of a node B, the area occupied by a node B, and the number of data points which belong to the equally-sized subregion corresponding to node B. The root node of a normalized data space can then be defined as , , and . The son nodes of a node and the extend of the corresponding subregions can be defined recursively as .</p><p>The partitioning of a node on the next hierarchy level is done by first partitioning the node vertically (at ) and then, both halves are partitioned horizontally (at and ). The partitioning is therefore given by the three values , , and (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4)</ref>, which are determined as where ,</p><p>where ,</p><p>where .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Implementation Details</head><p>In some rare cases, the partitioning as described so far runs into problems. Even if the condition is fulfilled for node B, there may not be a straight-line partitioning of B into four subregions such that all data points can be visualized in the corresponding subregions. Consider the example in <ref type="figure">Figure 5a</ref>. In this case, the partitioning is only possible if the dividing line is split and used by both, the upper and the lower partition (cf. <ref type="figure">Figure 5b)</ref>. In our implementation of the   Gridfit algorithm, we solve this problem by making the dividing line part of both partitions. In placing pixels, we then have to be careful if the dividing line is used by both partitions. Let us consider the situation in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6a</ref>. If the data points of the upper partition are placed the dividing line is already completely filled (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6b</ref>). This however leads to the problem that one data point in the lower partition can not be placed any more (cf <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6c</ref>). Our implementation solves this rarely occurring problem by storing the data points which can not be placed in the first run and placing them to the nearest unoccupied position in a second run (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6d</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">B x min i 1 - B x max i 1 - B y min i 1 - B y max i 1 - x i y 2 i y 1 i B i E B ( ) x min x max y min y max , , , ( ) = A B ( ) B.x max B.x min - ( ) B.y max B.y min - ( ) ⋅ = P B ( ) B 0 E B 0 ( ) 0 1 0 1 , , , ( ) = A B 0 ( ) 1 = P B 0 ( ) N = B 1 i B 2 i B 3 i B 4 i , , , ( ) B i 1 - E B 1 i ( ) B x min i 1 -x i B y min i 1 -y 1 i , , , ( ) = E B 2 i ( ) x i B x max i 1 -B y min i 1 -y 2 i , , , ( ) = E B 3 i ( ) B x min i 1 -x i y 1 i B y max i 1 - , , , ( ) = E B 4 i ( ) x i B x max i 1 -y 2 i B y max i 1 - , , , ( ) = x i y 1 i y 2 i x i y 1 i y 2 i x i B x min i 1 - B x max i 1 - + 2 ------------------------------∆x + = ∆x min x 9 ∈ P B 1 ( ) P B 3 ( ) + A B 1 ( ) A B 3 ( ) + ≤ P B 2 ( ) P B 4 ( ) + A B 2 ( ) A B 4 ( ) + ≤ ∧ { } = y 1 i B y min i 1 - B y max i 1 - + 2 ------------------------------∆y 1 + = ∆y 1 min y 9 ∈ P B 1 ( ) A B 1 ( ) ≤ P B 3 ( ) A B 3 ( ) ≤ ∧ { } = y 2 i B y min i 1 - B y max i 1 - + 2 ------------------------------∆y 2 + = ∆y 2 min y 9 ∈ P B 2 ( ) A B 2 ( ) ≤ P B 4 ( ) A B 4 ( ) ≤ ∧ { } =</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Comparison and Evaluation</head><p>All algorithms introduced in section 2 and 3 have been implemented as part of the VisualPoints system. The system is implemented in C++ and is running under HP-UX and LINUX. Public-domain versions of the system are available via http://www.informatik.uni-halle.de/~keim/VisualPoints.</p><p>We have used the VisualPoints system to evaluate and compare the different algorithms. We evaluated not only the efficiency but also their mathematically defined absolute and relative position-and distance-preservation (cf. subsection 2.1) and their visual effectiveness. For the experiments, we use a number of different data sets including two different versions of a world map containing simulated data, a real data set of lightning strikes, and a synthetic data set which has been designed to demonstrate effects and artifacts of the algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Efficiency</head><p>The theoretical time and space complexities of the three algorithm are all similar. In all three cases, the space complexity is O(N) and the time complexity is between O(N) in the best case to O(N 2 ) in the worst case.</p><p>An experimental evaluation based on different realistic data sets, however, clearly shows the advantage of the Gridfit algorithm. Since the number of data points which on the average would be positioned at the same pixel plays an important role in all algorithms, we used a few data sets with a different overlap-factor (OF). In <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>, we provide the performance curves for a varying overlap-factor. It is clear that for all algo-rithms the time increases significantly with an increasing overlap-factor. In <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, we present the time performance of the three algorithms for a small, medium, and large overlap-factor. For all three data sets, the Gridfit algorithm significantly faster than the other two algorithms, and the nearestneighbor algorithm is faster than the curve-based algorithm. The speed-up of the Gridfit algorithm increases with the overlap-factor and reaches a factor of about 13 over the curvebased algorithm and a factor of about 4 over the nearestneighbor algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Effectiveness</head><p>More important than the efficiency, however, is the effectiveness of the visualizations. The effectiveness can be determined by visually comparing the generated visualizations but it can also (at least partially) be determined mathematically according to our optimizations goals. Before presenting the visual comparison in subsection 4.3, in this subsection we briefly present the measured effectiveness, i.e. the absolute and relative position and distance preservation (cf. the definitions in subsection 2.1) for an L 1 distance function (d).</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, we present the absolute position measure of the three algorithms depending on the overlap-factor. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> clearly shows that the Gridfit algorithm provides a smaller average deviation from the original position than the nearest-neighbor and curve-based algorithms, especially for higher overlap factors. This can also be confirmed by the visual comparison presented in subsection 4.3. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref> presents the development of the relative position measure with increasing overlap-factor. It measures how good the relative position of the data points is preserved in the visualization (a smaller value means a better relative position preservation).</p><p>Here, the advantage of the Gridfit algorithm over the nearestneighbor and curve-based algorithms becomes even more impressive. The improvement is up-to 390% over the nearestneighbor and up-to 870% over the curve-based algorithm. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref> shows the relative distance measure of the three algorithms for an overlap-factor of about 10. In this case, all three algorithms provide about the same performance, and the value of the Gridfit algorithm is between the nearest-neighbor and the curve-based algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Visual Comparison</head><p>All formal effectiveness measures as defined by the absolute and relative position and distance are of limited value if they do not correspond to improvements in the generated visualizations. In this section, we therefore provide a visual comparison of the three techniques which in general confirms the measured effectiveness criteria presented in the previous subsection.</p><p>Our first comparison uses a greyscale world data map with simulated points distributed over the surface of dry land. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> shows the result of visualizing the data using our nearest-neighbor, curve-based, and Gridfit algorithms on two different resolutions. The visualizations clearly shows their advantages and disadvantages. The nearest-neighbor algorithm provides nice results, at least for the portion of data which can be placed at its original position in the first step of the algorithm. The contours of the continents are clearly visible in their original size. All data points which can not be placed in the first step, however, do not show any structure (cf. right portion of a <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13a</ref>). In case of the curve-based algorithm, the continents are rather distorted and their contours are barely visible. In the lower resolution picture (cf. right portion of a <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13b</ref>), there seems to be no similarity to the original image. This result corresponds to the result of our theoretical effectiveness comparison (cf. subsection 4.2) which showed that the curved-based algorithm is worse than the other two approaches. The visualization generated by the Gridfit algorithm also confirms the results of the theoretical effectiveness comparison, namely that the Gridfit algorithm provides significantly better results than the other two approaches (cf. right portion of a <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13c)</ref>. In contrast to the nearest-neighbor algorithm, the Gridfit algorithm enlarges and distorts the contours such that all points can be placed close to their original position. As a result, the visualization retains the spatial locality of the data points as much as possible, which results not only in a better (absolute and relative) position-preservation but also in a better visual representation of the data.</p><p>To analyze the properties of three algorithms in more detail, we designed a synthetic data set consisting of a number of objects with different properties (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 14a)</ref>. Besides a few simple objects such as circles, straight and curved lines, we also include vertical and horizontal bars and text as well as rectangular and circular patterns. In the visualizations generated by our three algorithms, some of the properties of the algorithms get clearer. Again, the curve-based algorithm provides the poorest results for all types of objects (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 14c</ref>). The nearest-neighbor algorithm provides rather good results, especially for the text (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 14b)</ref>. The main problem of the algorithm, however, are the rectangular and circular patterns which show the correct result in the center but no structure for the overlapping data points positioned in the second step of the algorithm. Since patterns are very important in data exploration, this turns out to be the major drawback of the nearest-neighbor algorithm. In contrast, the Gridfit algorithm performs nicely for all types of objects (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 14d</ref>). Note that the rectangular and circular patterns are enlarged which is a desired effect for preserving the spatial locality as much as possible.</p><p>The third examples shows a series of four Gridfit visualizations of a colored world map at different resolutions (from a very high resolution without overlapping data points in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 15a</ref> to a low resolution version in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 15d</ref> where basically all pixels of the display are used). It is interesting to consider the development of the distortion of the continents. In the first visualization (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 15b)</ref>, the continents are more compact; their shape however is still pretty much un- changed. In the next version (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 15c</ref>), the continents started to get distorted and the partitioning lines of the quadtree data structure become visible (e.g., in the blue region corresponding to the African continent). In the final visualization (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 15d</ref>), basically all pixels of the display are used and the continents are distorted to fill all screen space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we presented three algorithms for visualizing large amounts of spatially referenced data. The algorithms avoid the problem of losing information by overplotting data points. Instead, they map each data point to one pixel of the display and try to preserve the spatial locality (position and distances) as much as possible. We used a number of test data sets to evaluate and compare the three algorithms. It turns out that the Gridfit algorithm significantly outperforms the other two algorithms with respect to their efficiency and their (mathematical and visual) effectiveness. In our future work, we will investigate other approaches for visualizing spatially referenced data. One idea is to use a cluster-based approach which first tries to identify the clusters in the data and then transforms the cluster to retain their spatial properties as much as possible (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref>). We implemented a first version of this algorithm. The generated visualizations, however, turned out to be worse than the visualizations generated by the nearest-neighbor algorithm and the efficiency is worse by orders of magnitude. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>( 3 )</head><label>3</label><figDesc>relative distance-preservation where d is an arbitrary distance metric in 2D such as or the Euclidean metric .</figDesc></figure>
