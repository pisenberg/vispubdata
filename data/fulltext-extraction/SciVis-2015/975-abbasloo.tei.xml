<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The visual representation and interactive exploration of errors and uncertainty in three-dimensional scientific visualizations had long been neglected <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, but has recently come into the focus of visualization research <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. In particular, there has been considerable progress on mathematical modeling and visualization of isosurfaces in uncertain scalar fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, and on the extraction of features in uncertain vector fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</p><p>In comparison to scalar and vector fields, data uncertainty in tensor fields is more complex and multifaceted, since it can affect different aspects of the tensor field, such as trace, anisotropy, or orientation. Moreover, considering the uncertainty in each of these properties in isolation does not provide a comprehensive picture, since there may be statistical dependencies between them. It is due to this complexity that, even though applications as diverse as mechanical engineering, medical imaging, geometry, computational fluid dynamics, and image processing have benefitted from tensor field visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, tools for the visual analysis of uncertainty in those fields are still hard to come by.</p><p>Covariance is a fundamental mathematical description of uncertainty in multivariate data, expressing not only the variances in each data channel or coefficient, but also linear dependences between them. If the random variable itself is a second order tensor, covariance is represented by a partially symmetric fourth order tensor <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. For example, it might indicate variance related to the trace and anisotropy of the tensor, but also the fact that increased trace might be associated with weaker anisotropy.</p><p>Even in the scalar case, it has been pointed out that visualizations of three dimensional data often have high visual complexity, and care has to be taken to avoid visual clutter when adding uncertainty visualization to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Clearly, this problem is exacerbated when visualizing uncertain second order tensor fields, which involve a second order mean tensor plus a fourth order covariance tensor at each point of three dimensional space. Given this high complexity in data domain and range, it does not seem promising to try and visualize all aspects of tensor covariance simultaneously. Therefore, our work proposes a set of complementary tools that visualize tensor covariance at different levels of detail, following a strategy that has been phrased by Shneiderman as the visual information seeking mantra "Overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand" <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Our paper is organized as follows: After reviewing related work in Section 2, we introduce the theoretical background of fourth order covariance tensors, which are new to the visualization community, in Section 3. We then present the three pillars of our framework. Section 4 describes overview visualizations, indicating largescale changes in covariance structures and locations of high variance. Section 5 presents a tool for interactively exploring the exact nature of variability by going back and forth between the spatial domain and the high-dimensional data space containing the second order mean tensor and the fourth order covariance. Finally, Section 6 introduces glyph animations and overlays that, once the analyst decides to focus on a specific point in 3D space, visually represent the full confidence interval there. Throughout the paper, measurement noise in diffusion MRI is used to illustrate our techniques. To emphasize the general applicability of our framework, Section 7 presents an alternative use case, ensemble visualization of stress tensor fields from solid mechanics simulations. Section 8 discusses advantages and limitations of our system, before Section 9 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Several previous works have visualized specific aspects of uncertainty in tensor fields. Examples are positional uncertainty in isosurfaces of anisotropy measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, uncertainty in the direction of the principal eigenvector <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>, or in the resulting tensor lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>.</p><p>All these works have focused on visualizing the uncertainty in one specific type of tensor visualization, which is a good strategy to assess to which extent that particular visualization can be relied upon. In contrast, our framework provides a tool that can be used to gain a comprehensive understanding of all aspects of covariance in a given tensor field. For example, it can be used to understand how measurement noise in different acquisition methods affects the whole tensors: Not just specific visualizations, such as tensor lines, but also measures that would be used for quantitative analysis, such as trace or anisotropy.</p><p>Even though we are not aware of any previous work that has specifically addressed the visualization of tensor normal distributions, the papers that have introduced them to the medical imaging and signal processing communities have included glyph representations of fourthorder covariance tensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. In Section 6.1, we will discuss them in detail, and demonstrate that our own glyph visualizations provide the additional benefit of illustrating how the covariance affects the mean tensor, effectively visualizing confidence intervals.</p><p>Our work specifically addresses data uncertainty in second order tensor fields. Other sources of uncertainty affect tensor visualizations and have been considered in the visualization literature, including uncertainty from parameters in fiber tractography <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> or from choosing between different visualization algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, second order covariance tensors have previously been considered in uncertainty visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. However, they have been used to encode spatial covariance in scalar fields. In our work, we assume that the random tensors at different points of the field are statistically independent, as it is common when modeling, for example, the effects of thermal measurement noise. Adding spatial correlations would complicate our task significantly, and is left to future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 3.1 A Normal Distribution of Tensors</head><p>In order to model the uncertainty at each point of the tensor field, our work uses a generalization of the multivariate normal distribution to tensor-valued random variables. It is defined in analogy to the normal distribution of a vectorial random variable x ∈ R n , which, given a mean vectorx and a covariance matrix M, can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p(x) = 1 (2π) n |M| e − 1 2 (x−x) T M −1 (x−x) .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>A corresponding definition for a symmetric 3 × 3 tensorial random variable D, involving a mean tensorD and a fourth order covariance tensor Σ, has been proposed by Basser and Pajevic <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p(D) = 1 (2π) 6 |Σ| e − 1 2 (D−D):Σ −1 :(D−D)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The "double dot product" operator in Eq. (3) denotes a tensor contraction, so that the expression D :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Σ −1 : D = ∑ 3 i, j,m,n=1 D i j Σ −1</formula><p>i jmn D mn implies summation over all indices of the involved tensors. The fourth order covariance is defined using the tensor product ⊗ and the expectation E as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Σ = E[(D −D) ⊗ (D −D)].<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The symmetry in the arguments of the tensor product results in the socalled major symmetry Σ i jmn = Σ mni j . Additionally, minor symmetry Σ i jmn = Σ jimn = Σ i jnm follows from the symmetry of the random variable D itself. Note that this is not the same as full symmetry; for example, Σ i jmn = Σ im jn . Major and minor symmetries reduce the degrees of freedom in Σ from 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 81 to just 21. The benefit of the notation in Eq. (3) is the fact that it fully preserves the tensorial structure of D, while maintaining a close similarity to Eq. (2). However, it involves two non-standard operations: Taking the inverse Σ −1 of a fourth order tensor, and taking its determinant |Σ|. These follow naturally from an isometric embedding of D into R 6 . Given tensor coefficients D i j , representing D as a column vector,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">d = [D 11 , D 22 , D 33 , √ 2D 12 , √ 2D 13 , √ 2D 23 ] T ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>preserves the scalar product (for any two tensors D 1 and D 2 , D 1 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">D 2 = d 1 • d 2 )</formula><p>and thus angles and distances. This vectorization implies a representation of the fourth order covariance tensor Σ as a 6 × 6 matrix S, given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. Note that the major symmetry of Σ translates to symmetry of the corresponding matrix S. Based on these definitions of d and S, equivalence of Equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> and (3) can be achieved by defining inverse and determinant of Σ in terms of the same operations on its matrization S.</p><p>Eq. (3) generalizes quite naturally to asymmetric or higher order tensor fields. However, our current framework focuses on the symmetric 3 × 3 case, and a full treatment of other cases is left for future work. It is worth noting that, in general, Eq. (3) assigns a non-zero probability to tensors outside the positive definite cone, even if its parameters are estimated from positive definite tensors. In cases where this is undesired, one may easily combine it with the Log-Euclidean + = <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. These superquadric glyphs illustrate how, depending on the original tensor, adding the same perturbation (center of the image) affects different tensor properties, such as norm, orientation, or shape (from left to right). The same is true for the effect of covariance eigentensors on the mean tensor.</p><p>approach by Arsigny et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, even when dealing with diffusion tensors, we decided to apply Eq. (3) directly, following the reasoning of Pasternak et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, who argue that, even though diffusivity as a physical quantity is non-negative, estimates of diffusivity from MRI can become negative due to measurement noise, and clamping those negative estimates to zero introduces a statistical bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Spectral Decomposition of Covariance Tensors</head><p>Since covariance matrices M are real and symmetric, they permit a spectral decomposition M = EΛE T into an orthogonal matrix E, whose columns contain eigenvectors that represent the principal modes of variation, and a diagonal matrix Λ, containing the corresponding variances. This decomposition is the main mechanism behind the well-known Principal Component Analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. The same decomposition can be performed on the matrix representation S of a fourth order covariance tensor Σ. Using Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>, the six resulting principal modes can be mapped back to second order tensors E k . They are eigentensors with eigenvalues σ 2 k in the sense that</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Σ : E k = σ 2 k E k .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>The square in σ 2 k follows the notation of Basser and Pajevic <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. It serves as a reminder that eigenvalues of Σ represent variance, a quadratic quantity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Representation in IGRT Frame of Reference</head><p>When dealing with tensors, it is more intuitive to consider them in terms of their intrinsic properties such as trace or anisotropy, rather than in terms of their individual coefficients, which depend on the chosen frame of reference. Unfortunately, it is not easy to interpret a fourth order covariance tensor Σ or its eigentensors E k in terms of how they affect these intrinsic properties. This is because the same mode of variation can have a very different effect on different mean tensors. As an example of this, <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> presents a superquadric glyph visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> of the eigentensor</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">E = 1 √ 2   −1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0  <label>(7)</label></formula><p>at its center, and it demonstrates how adding this same perturbation to three different mean tensors (on the left) changes tensor norm, orientation, or shape (from left to right). Kindlmann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> propose a solution to this, which is based on three measures that quantify these intrinsic properties. K 1 is the same as tensor trace tr(D), the sum of all eigenvalues. Based on these definitions, the same authors construct a local orthonormal basis B for symmetric 3 × 3 tensors, which depends on the mean tensorD and can be used to obtain a more interpretable representation of Σ. Let B be the matrix whose columns result from representing the elements from B as vectors in R 6 via Eq. The off-diagonal elements of R correspond to the respective covariances. B is constructed from invariant gradients, i.e., the gradients of K * with respect to the six-dimensional tensor space, indicating how the tensor coefficients ofD have to change in order to change the three invariants K * most rapidly. B can be made orthonormal because the gradients of K * are mutually orthogonal, and can be extended to a basis by adding three rotation tangents, which specify the changes in tensor coefficients caused by infinitesimal rotations ofD around its three eigenvectors.</p><p>Since B is constructed from Invariant Gradients and Rotation Tangents, we refer to it as the IGRT frame of reference. Its full derivation and the exact equations are too complex to present here, but can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. For the purpose of our work, it is important that R permits an intuitive interpretation of fourth order covariance tensors in terms of how they affect shape and orientation of the corresponding mean tensor. This is not obvious from the original tensors Σ, and helps to visualize them in a meaningful way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">OVERVIEW VISUALIZATIONS: SLICE VIEWS AND DIRECT VOLUME RENDERING</head><p>Our framework uses slice views and direct volume rendering to produce overview visualizations that show large-scale spatial structures in the uncertain tensor field and provide a starting point for interactive analysis. The same basic strategy, reducing the high-dimensional data to color, or even a single scalar value, and displaying the result with standard visualization techniques, has been used widely and successfully in tensor field visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. The challenge in applying this idea to our data is to define suitable summary measures and color maps. The example dataset on which all our definitions and techniques are illustrated is a brain dataset from diffusion tensor MRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> (2 mm isotropic voxel size, 66 uniformly distributed diffusion weighted measurements at b = 1000 s/mm 2 plus one non diffusion weighted reference). Fourth order covariance tensors describing the uncertainty in the tensor estimates under measurement noise have been estimated using the established residual bootstrapping technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Since the data resolution is relatively coarse (112 × 112 × 60 voxels), we upsampled it with a narrow Gaussian kernel (0.7 voxels standard deviation) to produce a clearer overview of larger-scale structures. The detail visualizations in later sections all use the original data. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Scalar Summary Measures</head><p>A natural question to ask about an uncertain tensor field is in which locations uncertainty is high overall. It can be answered by computing the trace of the covariance matrix from Eq. (1). Based on the spectral decomposition, the trace can be interpreted as the sum of variances along all principal modes of variation. Trace has previously been proposed as a scalar invariant of Σ [3], but has not been visualized. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref> (b) maps its square root and, in (a), compares it to the mean diffusivity of the mean diffusion tensorD. This comparison indicates that overall variance is large in regions of high diffusivity, such as the ventricles (yellow arrows in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3 (a)</ref>). This is not surprising, since according to diffusion MR physics, high diffusivity leads to low signal amplitude in the diffusion weighted images, which in turn means low signal to noise ratio and thus high uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Interestingly, overall variance is also elevated in some other regions, such as the thalamus (red arrows in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3 (b)</ref>). This insight is relevant to approaches that use diffusion MR data to segment thalamic subnuclei <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>.</p><p>Tensors can either be anisotropic (i.e., exhibit directional dependence), or they can be isotropic (i.e., constant over all directions). Similarly, the uncertainty in a tensor can either be equally strong in all directions (isotropic uncertainty), or some directions can be more uncertain than others (anisotropic uncertainty). Conceptually, these two issues are completely independent. For example, if a diffusion MRI protocol measures diffusion in specific directions with higher precision than in others <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, the uncertainty can be anisotropic even when measuring isotropic diffusion.</p><p>Fractional Anisotropy (FA) is widely used to measure tensor anisotropy. It is computed from the normalized variance of tensor eigenvalues λ i around their meanλ <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>: Generalizing FA, we propose a novel Fractional Covariance Anisotropy (FCA) measure to quantify the anisotropy in tensor uncertainty. It may appear tempting to simply consider the normalized variance of the eigenvalues σ 2 k introduced in Section 3.2. However, that would overestimate the true anisotropy. This is because, in contrast to second order tensors, which are isotropic if and only if all eigenvalues coincide, isotropic fourth order covariance tensors form a two-dimensional subspace, parameterized by eigenvalues</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">FA = 3 2 (λ 1 −λ ) 2 + (λ 2 −λ ) 2 + (λ 3 −λ ) 2 λ 2 1 + λ 2 2 + λ 2 3<label>(9)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">σ 2 1 = χ κ ; σ 2 2 = σ 2 3 = σ 2 4 = σ 2 5 = σ 2 6 = χ µ<label>(10)</label></formula><p>with corresponding normalized eigentensor</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">E 1 = 1 √ 3   1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1  <label>(11)</label></formula><p>and arbitrary orthonormal tensors E 2 -E 6 that extend E 1 to a basis of all symmetric 3 × 3 tensors (one such basis is written out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>). The intuition behind this fact is that adding or removing the isotropic eigentensor E 1 from an isotropic fourth order covariance tensor keeps it isotropic, as does a uniform scaling. Our novel FCA accounts for this by projecting Σ onto the subspace orthogonal to E 1 ⊗E 1 ,Σ = Σ−(E 1 : Σ : E 1 )(E 1 ⊗E 1 ), and considering the normalized variance of the remaining five non-trivial eigenvalues ofΣ, which we denote asσ <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> k , around their meanσ 2 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">FCA = 1 2 ∑ 5 k=1 (σ 2 k −σ 2 ) 2 ∑ 5 k=1 (σ 2 k ) 2<label>(12)</label></formula><p>This novel measure is visualized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3 (d)</ref>. The fact that it is strikingly similar to standard FA in (c) illustrates that the physics behind diffusion MRI lead to an inevitable link between anisotropic diffusion and anisotropic uncertainty. Since the effective signal to noise ratio depends on the diffusivity, anisotropic diffusion leads to an anisotropic uncertainty in the measurements. Even though this has been known in theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and confirmed using Monte Carlo simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, our novel FCA summary measure allows us, for the first time, to visualize this effect on real-world data, and to visually compare it to the anisotropy of the diffusion tensors themselves.</p><p>In tensor fields from other sources, anisotropy of the tensors (FA) and anisotropy of their variance (FCA) may be independent. For example, the green arrow in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref> (f) highlights a feature in the FCA map of the first stress tensor field ensemble from Section 7, which is not present in the FA map of the mean tensors (e).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Color Mapping the Direction of Maximum Variance</head><p>If uncertainty is anisotropic, it is natural to ask in which direction variance is largest. We will now derive a color mapping to indicate this direction. For a random diffusion tensor D that follows the normal distribution in Eq. (3) and a fixed unit vector x, the expected value of the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) in direction x has been shown to be x TD x <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, with variance</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Var(x T Dx) = (x ⊗ x) : Σ : (x ⊗ x) = 3 ∑ i, j,k,l=1 Σ i jkl x i x j x k x l .<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Writing out Eq. (13) in index notation makes it obvious that, in this expression, the partially symmetric covariance tensor Σ can be replaced with an equivalent totally symmetric tensor S , reducing its 21 independent coefficients to only 15. Since we are not aware of any work that has used this relationship previously, we specify the required component mapping in Appendix A.</p><p>The reduced tensor S contains all information needed to compute variance along any given direction. This totally symmetric part of Σ can be visualized with a range of existing techniques for symmetric fourth order tensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. In particular, a rank one approximation will readily provide the direction of largest variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. It is color coded in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4 (b)</ref>, using the XYZ-RGB color map that is the de facto standard in diffusion tensor visualization. Comparing it to a standard principal eigenvector map ofD in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4 (a)</ref> shows that the two are in close agreement. Slight variations in intensity result from the fact that colors in (a) have been modulated with FA, while those in (b) have been modulated with FCA, which, as we have seen in the previous subsection, is correlated with, but not identical to FA. This visualization indicates that, in diffusion tensor data, uncertainty in ADC values is usually highest in direction of the fiber (axial diffusivity).</p><p>What is lost when reducing Σ to S is information about how ADCs in different directions covary. Visualizing this is left to our interactive exploration and glyph based techniques in later sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Volume Rendering Tensor Covariance</head><p>The novel scalar summary measures and color maps for fourth order covariance tensors that we have derived in the previous subsections follow the widely established ones from diffusion tensor visualization. Beside these, we also provide an overview visualization that takes its inspiration from the concept of an automated default transfer function, which has been proposed by Kniss et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> as a starting point for interactive exploration of scalar volumes.</p><p>The goal of default transfer functions is to provide an initial overview of important spatial structures in the data, without requiring the user to design a custom transfer function. For scalar volumes, default transfer functions have been defined by automatically assigning opacity to regions of high gradient magnitude, which often corresponds to boundaries between different materials or objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Gradient magnitude can also be measured in covariance tensor fields: Here, the spatial gradient ∇Σ is a fifth order tensor, and its magnitude ∇Σ F can simply be computed by taking the Frobenius norm (i.e., the square root of the sum of squares of all its entries).</p><p>Since the numerical range of ∇Σ F is not known a priori, we compute a standardized gradient magnitude z by subtracting the mean over the spatial domain, and dividing by the standard deviation. We then map these normalized values to opacity α ∈ [0, 1] using the logistic function</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">α = 1 1 + e −(z−1) .<label>(14)</label></formula><p>The color in default transfer functions has been set by applying a spectral color map to the range of given scalar values <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. For covariance tensors, this does not have an obvious counterpart. While it would be possible to use our color mapping from Section 4.2, or to apply any color map to our scalar measures from Section 4.1, this would imply focusing on one specific aspect of the data, such as overall variance, or direction of largest variance. Therefore, we opted for a different strategy, which we consider to be more in line with the goal of providing an unbiased, data-driven overview of the most important structures: We use dimensionality reduction to embed the full 21-dimensional fourth order tensors into the perceptually uniform CIELAB color space. Our implementation follows a recent approach by Hamarneh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. It uses ISOMAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, followed by a similarity transformation to fit the resulting 3D embedding into the sRGB gamut.</p><p>We expected that our default transfer function would use the full color spectrum to account for the high dimensionality and complexity of the data. Our initial result, presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5 (a)</ref>, did not meet this expectation: It mainly distinguishes between two dominant regions. Comparing this result to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3 (b)</ref> indicates an agreement with regions of low (greenish) and high (purple) overall variance.</p><p>Apparently, these large differences in scale dominate the dimensionality reduction when measuring differences in terms of the Frobenius norm. This effect is removed if we first normalize all covariance tensors by dividing each tensor by its trace. This leads to the more nuanced visualization in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5 (b)</ref>, in which major anatomical structures, such as the corpus callosum and cingulum bundle, or the cortical folding become apparent.</p><p>Note that interpretation of color in these visualizations differs fundamentally from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref>. Individual colors in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref> do not stand for any specific property, such as maximum variance in a given direction; rather, colors are chosen such that similar covariance tensors are assigned perceptually similar colors. An example of a conclusion we can draw from the rightmost image of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5 (b)</ref> is that normalized covariance is quite homogeneous over the corpus callosum, which appears in blue, but differs from the one in the cingulum bundle, which is located above it and is more heterogeneous, appearing in cyan, green, reddish, and pink colors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">INTERACTIVE EXPLORATION: HOW DOES COVARIANCE AF-</head><p>FECT THE MEAN? Our summary measures and default transfer functions provide an initial overview, but they consider the covariance tensor Σ in isolation. In order to obtain a full understanding of the uncertain tensor field, we also need to consider the mean tensorD from the tensor normal distribution in Eq. (3). In particular, it is important to keep in mind that, as it was illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>, the same covariance Σ can affect the intrinsic properties of different mean tensorsD in completely different ways.</p><p>Therefore, our tools for interactive exploration make use of the IGRT frame of reference. As explained in Section 3.3, it provides a rotated matrix representation R of the covariance that indicates variance associated with changes in trace and anisotropy, and with rotations around the eigenvectors.</p><p>The field of symmetric 6 × 6 matrices R contains the information we are interested in, but requires us to deal with 21 independent coefficients at each point of three-dimensional space. Our system allows the user to interactively explore this complex data using two main strategies: Similarity maps for finding regions of similar covariance, and linked views to switch back and fourth between the three-dimensional domain and the 21-dimensional range of the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Highlighting Regions of Similar Covariance</head><p>The similarity view of our system uses a white-yellow-red color map to indicate how similar the matrix R l at each location l is compared to the matrix R re f at a reference voxel, which the user selects by clicking on it. Normalized differences are computed using the Frobenius norm, and mapped to a normalized similarity s norm ∈ [0, 1] using the exponential,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">s norm (R l , R re f ) = e − R l R l F − R re f R re f F 2 F .<label>(15)</label></formula><p>Our framework also supports an unnormalized similarity,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">s raw (R l , R re f ) = e −γ R l −R re f 2 F .<label>(16)</label></formula><p>with an additional parameter γ that tunes it to the overall scale of R. However, in our uncertain diffusion tensor data, s raw is dominated by the large differences in covariance trace (shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3 (b)</ref>), which makes s norm more informative. Our graphical user interface, shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, supports exploring the three-dimensional structure of similarity maps through three linked orthogonal slice views, and a volume rendering view. <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref> shows three examples of similarity maps, obtained with s norm and reference voxels within the corticospinal fluid (CSF), gray matter (GM), and white matter (WM). The fact that, in each case, large parts of the same tissue are highlighted as similar indicates that measurement noise in our experimental setup affects the estimated tensors in a manner that is specific to each tissue type. In particular, even though <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3 (d)</ref> suggests that covariance is quite isotropic in both gray matter and CSF, <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref> (b/c) reveal that the exact characteristics still differ.</p><p>Moreover, comparing <ref type="figure">Fig. 7 (d)</ref> to the standard XYZ-RGB color coding of the mean tensor in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7 (a)</ref> shows that only those parts of the white matter are highlighted as similar that contain a very clear dominant fiber orientation. This makes sense anatomically, since the reference voxel was selected from the corpus callosum. The visualization makes it clear that tensors in the crossing and fanning fibers within the corona radiata are affected differently by the noise. Both observations will be investigated more closely in the next subsection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Exploring Individual Aspects of Tensor Covariance</head><p>Once the user has discovered spatial regions of similar covariance behavior, it is natural to drill down even deeper and find out the exact extent to which covariance in each of them affects tensor trace, anisotropy, and orientation. To this end, we provide linked views that allow the user to easily switch back and forth between exploring the three-dimensional spatial domain, and the 21-dimensional range of matrices R at each point. This is similar to the strategy of dual-domain interaction in multi-dimensional transfer function design <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>The unique coefficients of the normalized symmetric matrix R l / R l F are visualized in a matrix view, shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6 (a,b)</ref>. When the user clicks on a voxel, this view is updated to reflect the matrix at the selected location l. After normalization, all entries range in [−1, 1], and we use a diverging color map from white to red and blue to indicate positive and negative covariance, respectively. Diagonal elements encode variance, which is always positive. Exact values are displayed as tooltips when the cursor is on an element. As illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, clicking on a matrix element highlights it with a border, and spatially maps that element in the linked slice and volume rendering views, revealing spatial patterns in that specific aspect of tensor covariance. <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> presents several findings from using this system. In a mostly isotropic CSF voxel (a), we expected to find the pattern of isotropic covariance discussed in Section 4.1, with one value χ κ for variance aligned with changes in trace (top left element of R), and a second value χ µ that should be the same for all remaining diagonal entries. While this is approximately met by <ref type="figure">Fig. 6 (a)</ref>, there is some remaining variance in the second to sixth diagonal elements, and a weak negative covariance between trace and anisotropy. This appears to be the reason why CSF and gray matter, in which the expected isotropic covariance is met almost perfectly, were recognized as distinct groups in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>.</p><p>The fact that normalized variance aligned with trace is found to be relatively small, and nearly uniform over space (c) agrees with results from a previous study, which has found estimates of trace from noisy diffusion MRI to be more reliable than estimates of anisotropy, with only weak dependence on the underlying mean tensor shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>In a white matter voxel from the corpus callosum (b), variance corresponding to changes in the amount of anisotropy is largest, followed by variance corresponding to rotations around the second and third eigenvectors, which together influence the principal eigenvector. We found similar patterns in other regions that are commonly thought to contain a single dominant fiber bundle. The fact that these factors are highly relevant to tractography <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> reinforces the need for highquality data for reliable fiber tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Spatially mapping normalized variance aligned with changes in the amount (d) and type (e) of anisotropy clearly reveals the white matter outlines, confirming that this behavior is present throughout white matter.</p><p>Interestingly, we also found notable covariations. In particular, there was a negative relationship between changes in trace and the type of anisotropy. The fact that a previous study has reported a strong negative correlation of trace and anisotropy in patients with ischemic leukoaraiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> makes it particularly noteworthy that a similar correlation, consistent over white matter (f), is already induced by the measurement noise when scanning a healthy volunteer. We also found a correlation between changes in the amount and type of anisotropy, negative in regions with a clear dominant orientation, positive in other parts of white matter (g). To our knowledge, this observation, which is made possible by our new visualization system, has not been reported previously. It merits a further investigation (e.g., using Monte Carlo methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>) which is, however, beyond the scope of our current work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DETAILS ON DEMAND: GLYPH ANIMATION AND SMALL MULTIPLES</head><p>A benefit of the matrix views presented in the previous section is the fact that, at a single glance, they provide an overview of what fraction of the covariance at a point affects the different intrinsic properties of the mean tensorD, and how different properties are correlated. However, they do not provide an impression of the confidence interval around the mean tensorD. This is only partly due to the fact that the matrix views normalize out the overall magnitude of the variance. Even when given absolute numerical values, it is difficult even for an expert to imagine how strong the corresponding effect on the mean tensor actually is. Glyphs are widely used to graphically represent the complete information in individual tensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. Our framework animates and superimposes superquadric tensor glyphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> in order to intuitively convey the confidence intervals of tensor normal distributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Existing Glyphs and Their Limitations</head><p>Basser and Pajevic <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> have previously used glyphs to visualize fourth order covariance tensors. They call their method a "visualization of the radial projection", and we refer to it as a "radial glyph" for brevity. It uses surfaces whose parametric form is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">{ f (x)x | x = 1} with f (x) = (x ⊗ x) : Σ : (x ⊗ x).<label>(17)</label></formula><p>Fig <ref type="figure">. 9</ref>. Frames from a stress tensor glyph animation illustrate the variation from mixed compression and tension (left) to pure anisotropic tension (right) which is caused by varying the external forces.</p><p>Comparing this definition of f (x) to Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> shows that, when applying the radial glyphs to Σ, they indicate the variance in each direction. Basser and Pajevic <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> only show this glyph for individual covariance tensors. When using it to visualize uncertainty in tensor fields, we found that the squaring inherent in the definition of Σ leads to large variations in overall glyph size, preventing effective simultaneous visualization of regions of larger and smaller overall variation.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8 (b)</ref>, we instead apply this glyph to the square root of the covariance √ Σ, which we define using the spectral decomposition from Section 3.2 by taking √ Λ as a diagonal matrix containing the positive square roots of σ 2 k , multiplying out √ S = E √ ΛE T with the eigentensors in E, and mapping √ S back to a fourth order tensor √ Σ using Eq. (1). Visualizing √ Σ instead of Σ can be considered as a multivariate analogy of showing standard deviation rather than variance.</p><p>Comparing the resulting glyphs in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8 (b)</ref> to a superquadric glyph visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> of the mean tensors in (a) shows that, in single fiber regions, variances in (b) mostly appear to be govered by the diffusivity in (a). In Section 4.1, this was explained by the fact that effective signal to noise ratio depends on diffusivity. In regions of partial voluming or fiber crossings, the diffusion tensor model is a poor fit for the measured data, leading to more complex patterns of variance.</p><p>In Section 4.2, we have seen that computing variance in all directions only makes use of S , the totally symmetric part of Σ. One consequence of this is that, even though we have seen in Eq. (10) that isotropic covariance tensors have two parameters, they are all visualized as spheres, with only one degree of freedom (radius). In order to distinguish between different types of isotropy, Basser and Pajevic <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> propose an alternative visualization, in which variance plots are applied to each of the six principal modes of variation. To avoid having to inspect six separate images, they superimpose the plots. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8 (c)</ref> presents such a visualization, in which each unit eigentensor has been scaled with the square root of its corresponding eigenvalue.</p><p>These composite glyphs suffer from high visual complexity and occlusions. Moreover, they only show the eigentensors, without illustrating how they affect the mean, or indicating confidence intervals around it. As we have seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>, the effect of a perturbation can differ drastically depending on the original tensor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Visualizing Confidence Intervals with Animated Tensor Glyphs and Small Multiples</head><p>Superquadric glyphs are widely used in diffusion tensor imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and have also been generalized to indefinite tensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Confidence intervals of a tensorial probability distribution can be visualized in a natural and intuitive way by showing an animation of such glyphs that, starting at the mean tensorD, traverses the smallest part of tensor space that contains the desired fraction of the probability. It is not obvious what trajectory in the six-dimensional tensor space such an animation should follow. In our framework, we make use of the fact that the spectral decomposition from Section 3.2 identifies six principal modes of variation, which are mutually uncorrelated. Therefore, a good understanding of the six-dimensional confidence interval can be achieved by considering each eigenmode in turn. In particular, the kth eigenmode is visualized using the family of tensors</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">D(t; k) =D + tσ k E k<label>(18)</label></formula><p>where, during animation, t grows linearly from 0 to t max , shrinks to −t max , and returns to 0, before switching to the next eigenmode. According to the well-known properties of the Gaussian distribution, t max = 3 corresponds to a 99.7% confidence interval. Example frames from such an animation are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. Even though we found this animation to be very intuitive, it is sometimes desirable to summarize the confidence interval into a single static image. To this end, it is natural to superimpose glyphs. We found that overlaying only the two most extreme cases along each eigenmode produces sharper results than attempts to achieve a more continuous "motion blur", such as rasterizing a representative sampling of glyphs, and volume rendering the result <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. However, naïve superposition of opaque glyphs, as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8 (c)</ref>, leads to occlusion.</p><p>We avoid occlusions by rendering the two glyphs separately, in complementary colors (blue and orange), and adding the resulting images. This makes sure that both glyphs are fully visible, a white core is generated in regions where they overlap, and color indicates regions that are only covered by some part of the confidence interval. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 10</ref>, this method is applied to a normally distributed diffusion tensor in a typical single fiber voxel. It shows quite clearly that the largest eigenmode mainly affects axial diffusivity, the second and third rotate the direction of the principal eigenvector, the fourth varies radial diffusivity, and the remaining two have a rather weak effect overall. This finding agrees with the pattern observed in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6 (b)</ref>. However, the small multiples in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 10</ref> clearly depict the exact extent of these changes, which was apparent neither from the matrix views, nor from the eigenmodes in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8 (c)</ref>. In the right hand side of <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, the more intricate pattern of variation that occurs in a crossing fiber voxel is illustrated. In parallel to our work, the Tender glyph has been designed to specifically highlight differences in tensor shape and orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. It could be used as an alternative to our glyph overlays.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">APPLICATION TO STRESS TENSOR ENSEMBLES</head><p>In the previous sections, we used data uncertainty in diffusion tensors to illustrate and explain the elements of our framework. In order to demonstrate that our method is applicable to arbitrary fields of normally distributed symmetric 3 × 3 tensors, we will now present a second use case, in which the tensor normal distribution is used as a summary statistic for ensembles of indefinite stress tensor fields, which arise in solid mechanics and play an important role in applications such as medical implant planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> or mechanical design <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Experimental Setup</head><p>We created stress tensor fields by varying different parameters in a numerical simulation. In this setting, we are using the tensor normal distribution from Eq. (3) to summarize the resulting tensor field ensemble, and our visualization framework to investigate where, and in which way, the individual parameters affect the stress tensors.</p><p>The simulated system is a quadratic steel plate with side length l = 4 m and a circular hole with radius r = 0.5 m at its center. A uniform stretching force is applied along the left and right edges of the plate. Due to symmetry, it is sufficient to simulate the top right quarter of the plate with appropriate boundary conditions, cf. <ref type="figure">Fig. 11 (a)</ref>. We will report results on two experiments: In the first, a Gaussian distributed component tangential to the edge of the plate was added to the external force. It was assumed uniform along the part of the plate included in the simulation, but mirrored along the symmetry axis by the boundary condition. This led to compression at the center of the plate when the tangential component pointed downward (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 11 (b)</ref>), additional stretching when it pointed upward.</p><p>In the second experiment, the force was kept constant, orthogonal to the edge, but Poisson's ratio, a material property that reflects how much a material expands in directions perpendicular to a given direction of compression, was varied according to a Gaussian distribution. <ref type="figure">Fig. 12</ref> (a) maps tr(Σ), the square root of covariance trace, when varying the force at the edge of the plate. Numerical values are in the range [0, 49] kPa, with the highest value mapped to white. The largest impact is at the center of the edge (bottom right part of the plot due to the symmetry axes), where material is either compressed or stretched, depending on the direction of the parallel component. Interestingly, mapping the directions of maximum variance (b) reveals that it remains aligned with the change in the applied force only in some region along the edge (green), but switches to the other axis of the plate (red) at some point as the force propagates into the material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Results from Using our System</head><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig. 12 (c)</ref>, tr(Σ) is shown for the experiment changing Poisson's ratio. This had a much smaller effect overall, so white in this plot indicates tr(Σ) = 0.67 kPa. Here, stresses along the right edge are dominated by the external force, which is constant in this case, and the largest change occurs at the upper boundary of the circular hole. The direction of main variance is perpendicular to the plate throughout the domain (image not shown), reflecting the fact that stresses in that direction are dominated by the Poisson effect in our experiment. In this case, the normalized dimensionality embedding from Section 4.3, shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 12 (d)</ref>, provides a better impression of how the covariance structure changes over the plate.</p><p>Using the interaction and glyph views quickly revealed that, in both experiments and in almost all locations, varying the parameters only led to a single significant eigenmode in the variation of stress tensors, which also explains the high FCA values in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3 (f)</ref>. As an example, <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref> shows several frames from an animation that illustrates the change in stress tensors at the center of the right edge of the plate in the first experiment, ranging from mixed compression and tension (left; corresponding to external forces that pull the upper half down, the lower half up) to pure tension (right; corresponding to forces that pull the upper half up, but the lower half down).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>Similar to a previous work on tensor glyph design <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, the design of our system is primarily guided by mathematical principles, to ensure that it remains useful across a range of applications. Specifically, we present the first visualization system that accounts for the full covariance information in uncertain symmetric second order tensor fields. We have exemplified its practical utility on two quite different applications, analyzing the uncertainty in diffusion tensor MRI, and analyzing ensembles of stress tensor fields. We expect that our system will prove useful also in other domains in which tensor fields arise, such as geometry processing or fluid flow simulations.</p><p>In the specific application context of diffusion MRI, a limitation of dealing with second order tensors lies in their well-known inability to capture the orientations of crossing nerve fiber bundles. Therefore, when answering fundamental scientific questions, high angular resolution, multi-shell, or diffusion spectrum imaging are now preferred <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. However, the second order DT-MRI model remains popular in clinical practice and in clinical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, due to its much smaller demands on measurement time and hardware. Studying the many factors that affect measurement noise in DT-MRI, including the number and distribution of gradient directions, magnetic field strength, b value, echo time, and use of parallel imaging, remains an active topic in the medical imaging community <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In the future, our system could be used to confirm and possibly extend such insights.</p><p>A future application that we are even more excited about is the exploratory visualization of DT-MRI ensembles. Whereas traditional DT-MRI group analysis focuses on a few scalar measures such as Fractional Anisotropy or trace, our framework will allow us to account for variations in all aspects of the diffusion tensors. To facilitate such an analysis, it would be natural to extend our current framework in two ways: The first is to account for spatial correlations; the second is to add specific support for the visual comparison of two or more tensor distributions, such as diffusion tensors from different cohorts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">CONCLUSION</head><p>The normal distribution is one of the most widely applicable mathematical descriptions of uncertainty. Yet, a framework to describe normal distributions for tensorial random variables, involving a fourth order covariance tensor, has been proposed only recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Already in the symmetric 3 × 3 case, these distributions have six degrees of freedom in the mean tensor, and another 21 in the fourth order covariance, at each point of three-dimensional space. At the outset of our work, only some basic glyphs, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8 (b,c)</ref>, were available to visualize them.</p><p>Clearly, the complexity of this data prevents us from fully visualizing it at a single glance. Therefore, our work contributes a range of complementary visualization techniques, permitting a visual analysis that proceeds from coarse to fine levels of detail: Summary measures and default transfer functions provide an overview of large-scale structures; linked views allow for an interactive exploration that identifies regions of common behavior, and to drill down into how the covariance tensor affects intrinsic properties of the mean tensor in each of them. Finally, animated superquadric glyphs and glyph overlays provide an intuition of confidence intervals at individual locations.</p><p>We presented two example applications to illustrate the interplay between the different components of our system, and to demonstrate their effectiveness. In particular, exploring data uncertainty caused by measurement noise in DT-MRI has allowed us to gain insights on noise-induced correlations between diffusion tensor measures that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been reported previously.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>K 2 and K 3 are anisotropy measures, derived from the deviatoric partD = D − (tr(D)/3)I.
