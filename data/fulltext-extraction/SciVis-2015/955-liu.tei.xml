				<p>The heterogeneity and complexity of multivariate characteristics poses a unique challenge to visual exploration of multivariate scientific data sets, as it requires investigating the usually hidden associations between different variables and specific scalar values to understand the data&apos;s multi-faceted properties. In this paper, we present a novel association analysis method that guides visual exploration of scalar-level associations in the multivariate context. We model the directional interactions between scalars of different variables as information flows based on association rules. We introduce the concepts of informativeness and uniqueness to describe how information flows between scalars of different variables and how they are associated with each other in the multivariate domain. Based on scalar-level associations represented by a probabilistic association graph, we propose the Multi-Scalar Informativeness-Uniqueness (MSIU) algorithm to evaluate the informativeness and uniqueness of scalars. We present an exploration framework with multiple interactive views to explore the scalars of interest with confident associations in the multivariate spatial domain, and provide guidelines for visual exploration using our framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our approach through case studies using three representative multivariate scientific data sets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Scientific simulations often create multiple variables describing different physical properties within the same spatial domain. Usually, certain scalar values from a subset of variables carry a greater importance to the understanding of the underlying phenomena than others <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. For instance, in climate simulation, a hurricane typically forms as the warm, moist air over the ocean rises in the low air pressure area, which creates strong winds and heavy rainfall. However, without sufficient prior knowledge, it is generally difficult for users to select informative scalar values in a multivariate data space and understand how they are associated with scalar values of the other variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. This makes visual exploration of multivariate scientific data sets a difficult task using only the existing visualization techniques such as direct volume rendering <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and isosurface visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. More importantly, the heterogeneity and complexity of multivariate characteristics poses a unique challenge to this non-trivial problem, as it requires investigating the usually hidden associations between different variables and specific scalar values to understand the multi-faceted properties of the data sets.</p><p>Considering that each scalar value of a variable, or scalar in short, has a certain amount of information, encoded by the corresponding spatial data points, scalar-level interaction can be viewed as the amount of shared information that flows from one scalar to another scalar of a different variable. In this sense, the roles that scalars play in the entire data set are not equally informative. An informative scalar should reveal information about the associated scalars of other variables and how they interact <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The directional aspect of informa- tion flows should be taken into account to determine how informative one scalar is compared with the other in an association. Commonlyused correlation measures such as correlation coefficients and mutual information mostly focus on studying the symmetric and average relationship between variables, and thus are unable to reflect the directional scalar-level relationships. Consequently, even for two correlated variables, it is still unclear how a specific scalar in one variable is associated with another scalar of the other variable. In addition, the enormous multivariate space complicates the search of potentially interesting scalars. Due to the large number of possible associations with scalars of many different variables, it is non-trivial to determine the relative informativeness that a scalar has in the entire multivariate domain.</p><p>In this paper, we present a novel association analysis method that identifies informative scalars in multivariate data sets. To understand how the scalars interact with each other, we model the directional interactions between scalars of different variables as information flows based on association rules. Association rules are originally proposed by <ref type="bibr">Rakesh Agrawal et al. [2]</ref> to analyze relationships of sale products from supermarket basket transactions, and confident rules can infer the sales of other products by observing the sales of a given product. In our method, we treat each scalar as a sale product and a co-occurrence of scalars between different variables as a transaction. We define the amount of information that flows from one scalar to another as the confidence of an association rule, and estimate it using conditional probability. We model all possible associations between scalars of different variables using a probabilistic association graph called PAGraph, and determine the informativeness of scalars in the PAGraph based on information propagation. The PAGraph is analogous to a social network in terms of two important factors -influence/informativeness and passivity/uniqueness: (1) in a social network, an individual of high influence can attract his audience and lead the interactions, while an individual of high passivity is often inert in response to the interactions; (2) in a PAGraph, an informative scalar can reliably infer the existence of other scalars of different variables, while a unique scalar can hardly be predicted by other scalars of different variables. To quantify informativeness and uniqueness from scalar-level associations in the PAGraph, we propose the Multi-Scalar Informativeness-Uniqueness (MSIU) algorithm based on an information propagation model in social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Integrating our association analysis method with interactive visualization techniques, we present an exploration framework with multiple interactive views to explore the scalars of interest with confident associations in the multivariate spatial domain, and provide guidelines for visual exploration using our framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our approach in exploratory analysis using three representative multivariate data sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>In this section, we briefly review and discuss the previous research that are closely related to our work.</p><p>Multivariate data analysis is a well researched topic in the literature of scientific visualization. Wong and Bergeron <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, and Fuchs and Hauser <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> gave extensive reviews of multivariate data analysis and visualization. A fundamental research problem in this field is to study the relationships of variables in the multidimensional data space. Sauber et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> introduced local correlation coefficients to visualize relationships in multivariate data sets. Gosink et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> took normalized dot product between two gradient fields from two variables to derive correlation fields, which were then used to analyze the variable interactions with a third variable. Janicke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> adapted local statistical complexity from finite state cellular automata to identify informative regions in multivariate data. Nagaraj et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> proposed a gradient-based measure that reveals the relationships of variables for the purpose of comparative visualization. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> employed transfer entropy to study the causal relationships between variables. Turkay et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> proposed a multi-dimensional data exploration model by linking the items space and dimensions space. Tatu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> developed an interactive visualization system for exploring interesting subspaces of high-dimensional data. Guo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> integrated parallel coordinates plot (PCP) and multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots for manipulating multidimensional transfer functions. Watanabe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> applied biclustering techniques to extract feature subspaces from multivariate data. While most existing methods offer insights into the average relationships between variables, little study has focused on the specific relationships between different scalar values in different variables. Recently, Biswas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> employed the surprise and predictability metrics to measure the specific mutual information between a scalar value and a variable. These two metrics mostly focus on one-way interactions between two variables, and the extension to more than two variables is non-trivial. In this paper, we present a bottom-up approach to analyze scalar-level relationships in different variables for identifying the informative and unique scalars in multivariate data sets. Our approach copes with more than two variables by using two new metrics, informativeness and uniqueness, to reflect two-way interactions between one scalar value and other scalars of different variables.</p><p>Interaction and interface design are critical for visual exploration of complex data sets. Introduced by Becker and Cleveland <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, brushing became one of the most popular interactions for exploring data of interest. Martin and Ward <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> extended brushing to high-dimensional data space. Janicke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed to brush an attribute space derived from the high-dimensional data space. Coordinated and multiple views are an effective design for visual exploration through different presentations, where the changes in one representation will update the other views immediately <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Many examples are given by Roberts <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> in a survey of coordinated and multiple views in exploratory visualization. To represent relationships of variables, nodelink diagrams and PCP are commonly used, as in Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, and Biswas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In our work, we link a radial graph visualization with multiple PCPs to support brushing scalars of interest and simultaneously showing the confident associations. These two interactive views are also linked with volume rendering and isosurface visualization to provide a multi-view interface for visual exploration of multivariate scientific data sets.</p><p>Social network analysis studies social relationships from the standpoint of network theory. An important task is to identify influential people based on the information flows and propagation in the networks. Watts and Dodds <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> found that influence depends on how willing the audience are to adapt their behaviors and beliefs. Agarwal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> discovered that the most influential social media users were not necessarily the most active. Weng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> quantified the influence of Twitter users based on topical similarities and link structures. Goyal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> proposed to learn influence from past information propagation. Romero et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> devised a model to evaluate the influence and passivity of people in a social network based on information propagation, where the influence and passivity mutually depend on each other. Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> attempted to analyze the influence and passivity conditioned on specific themes. Inspired by Romero et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, we define informativeness and uniqueness in multivariate data sets in analogy to influence and passivity in social networks, and develop an association analysis algorithm to measure informativeness and uniqueness of scalars in multivariate data sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">SYSTEM OVERVIEW</head><p>The main objective of this work is to guide visual exploration of multivariate data sets based on scalar-level associations. Essentially, we analyze scalar-level associations to determine the informativeness and uniqueness of scalars, which describe the information flows between scalars of different variables and reveal how they interact with each other in the multivariate domain. Based on scalar-level associations, we design multiple interactive views to develop a framework for exploring scalar-level associations in multivariate data sets. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> illustrates our analytical workflow. From the input multivariate data set, we model all possible associations using a probabilistic association graph (Section 4.1 and 4.2). The informativeness and uniqueness of scalars are quantified by the proposed association analysis method (Section 4.3). To explore the scalars with associations of interest, the association graph with informativeness and uniqueness is used to cre- ate the PCP view and the PAGraph view, which are linked with isosurface visualization and direct volume rendering to reveal the spatial relationships of the selected scalars (Section 5.1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS IN MULTIVARIATE DATA SETS</head><p>In this section, we first model the directional interactions between scalars of different variables as information flows based on association rules, and describe how to represent scalar-level associations using a probabilistic multipartite graph. Then we introduce the concepts of informativeness and uniqueness to describe how information flows between scalars of different variables and how they are associated with each other in the multivariate domain. Finally we describe the Multi-Scalar Informativeness-Uniqueness (MSIU) algorithm to evaluate the informativeness and uniqueness of scalars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Modeling Directional Interactions as Information Flows</head><p>Considering that each scalar has a certain amount of information, encoded by the corresponding spatial data points, scalar-level interaction can be viewed as the amount of shared information that flows from one scalar to another scalar of a different variable. To quantify the information flows between scalars of different variables, we make use of association rules, which have been widely applied to discover interesting relationships among sale products in large transaction data sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. An association rule is defined as an implication of the form x â y. An example from the supermarket domain could be Bread â PeanutButter, suggesting that a strong association exists between the sale of bread and peanut butter because many customers who buy bread also buy peanut butter in one transaction. For a given association rule x â y, the strength of the rule can be measured in terms of its confidence, which can be interpreted as an estimate of the conditional probability p(y|x). The confidence of an association rule can be used to infer the dependency that y has on x. The higher the confidence, the more likely it is for x to infer the existence of y. In other words, y is more likely to depend on x.</p><p>To make the analogy from the supermarket domain to the multivariate domain, let us treat each scalar as a sale product, and a cooccurrence of the scalars between different variables as one transaction. Considering two scalars x i and x j from two different variables X i and X j , two possible association rules x i â x j and x j â x i can be learned based on their occurrence in the multivariate space. The joint probability p(x i , x j ) reflects the amount of information shared between the two scalars, and the conditional probability p(x j |x i ) reflects the amount of shared information that flows from x i to x j . Naturally, p(x j |x i ) quantifies the confidence of an association rule x i â x j in the multivariate scenario. Unlike most traditional correlation analysis that only studies the average symmetric relationships between variables, such an association-rule-based approach allows us to investigate pointwise directional relationships between scalars of different variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Probabilistic Association Graph</head><p>Given a multivariate data set, the scalars and the associated multiscalar interactions can be represented by a directed graph, where every node i â V is a scalar x i and every directed edge e(i, j) â E is an association rule x i â x j with the confidence p(x j |x i ). Essentially, the graph represents information propagation between scalars of different variables, as edges reflect the information flows. We call this the probabilistic association graph PAGraph(V, E). For a system of M variables, since every edge connects two nodes from different variables and no edge connects two nodes from the same variable, a PAGraph is basically a multipartite graph whose nodes can be divided into M disjoint sets. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref> illustrates examples of PAGraphs with M = 2, 3, 4.</p><p>Since a continuous scalar field contains an infinite number of values, each value domain is discretized into N bins to represent the entire field. We take the value at the center of a bin to represent the scalars that lie within the range of the bin. As a result, the number of nodes |V | is upper-bounded by MN, and the number of edges |E| is upper-bounded by M(M â 1)N 2 . Since many scalar values of different variables do not co-occur in the multidimensional space, |E| is often much smaller than M(M â 1)N 2 . To compute the conditional probability p(x j |x i ) for a pair of scalars of two different variables, we use 1D histogram to approximate the probability distribution p(x i ) for every variable, and 2D joint histogram to approximate the joint probability distribution p(x i , x j ) for every pair of variables, and hence we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p(x j |x i ) = p(x i , x j )/p(x i ).</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Informativeness and Uniqueness of Scalars</head><p>With the PAGraph, it is now possible to identify informative scalars over the multivariate domain, which can infer the existence of other scalars of different variables. From the standpoint of information flows, this is similar to identifying influential individuals in a social network based on their information propagating activities. In this section, we first discuss the analogy between social networks and PA-Graphs in terms of two important factors: influence/informativeness and passivity/uniqueness. Then we describe how to determine the informativeness and uniqueness of scalars in the multivariate domain using our PAGraph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">From Social Networks to Association Graphs</head><p>In the field of social network analysis, influence, which makes people adapt their behavior, attitudes or beliefs, has been an important factor that directs the dynamics of social media interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. High popularity does not necessarily infer high influence and vice-versa <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The further one's messages are propagated in the network by their connected people, the more influence they may have on others. Equally important is passivity, as many people are passive information consumers and do not forward the information to the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Passivity reflects the barrier to the propagation of messages that is often difficult to overcome. In a brief way, the influence and passivity measures of individuals in social networks can be interpreted as follows:</p><p>â¢ Influence: an individual of high influence can attract his audience and lead the social interactions.</p><p>â¢ Passivity: an individual of high passivity is often inert in response to the social interactions.</p><p>We observe two factors similar to influence and passivity in the multivariate domain. First, inter-dependencies exist between scalars of different variables, and the scalars that often occur with others actively engage in multi-scalar interactions, and thus have more information in terms of their predictability of the dependent scalars. It is also true that highly frequent scalars are not necessarily the most informative, as they can correspond to background noise or uninteresting regions. Second, certain scalars may not be easily inferred from other scalars of different variables, and thus are considered unique in the multi-scalar associations. In analogy to influence and passivity in social networks, we define the informativeness and uniqueness of scalars in the multivariate domain:</p><p>â¢ Informativeness: a scalar of high informativeness can reliably infer the existence of other scalars of different variables.</p><p>â¢ Uniqueness: a scalar of high uniqueness can hardly be inferred by other scalars of different variables.</p><p>To determine informativeness and uniqueness in multivariate data sets, we propose a multivariate association analysis method named the Multi-Scalar Informativeness-Uniqueness (MSIU) model, based on the Influence-Passivity (IP) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Next we introduce the basics of the IP model and its applications in social network analysis, and then describe our MSIU model in the multivariate scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Basics of the Influence-Passivity Model</head><p>The IP model was first proposed by Romero et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> to determine the influence and passivity of people in a social network based on the structural properties of the network as well as the diffusion behaviors among people. It utilizes the pairwise association information between people to calculate the relative influence and passivity each person has on the whole network. The IP model lies on the basis of the following relations in a social network:</p><p>â¢ A person's influence relies on the number of people he influences as well as their passivity.</p><p>â¢ A person's influence relies on how much he attracts the attention of his audience compared to other people.</p><p>â¢ A person's passivity relies on the influence of those who he is exposed to but not influenced by.</p><p>â¢ A person's passivity relies on how much he rejects other people's influence compared to everyone else.</p><p>Given a social network G(V, E) with individuals V and edges E, the weight w i j on an edge e(i, j) â E represents the ratio of influence that person i does exert on person j to the total influence that i attempts to exert on j. Romero et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> used the ratio of retweets as w i j , which is the number of i's tweets retweeted by j divided by the total number of i's tweets. For every edge e(i, j) â E, the acceptance rate is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">a i j = w i j â k:(k, j)âE w k j .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>This metric reflects the dedication j has to i in terms of information propagation. It measures the amount of influence that j accepts from i scaled by the total influence accepted by j from all people in the network. For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> shows that j accepts influence from four neighbors including i, and the acceptance rate a i j reflects how much i attracts the attention of j competing with other j's neighbors who may also influence j. On the other hand, the rejection rate is defined as:  This metric measures the amount of influence that j rejects from i scaled by the total influence from i rejected by all people in the network. This can also be illustrated using the example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref>: i attempts to influence four neighbors including j, and the rejection rate r i j assesses how much j rejects i's influence compared to other i's neighbors who may also reject i's influence.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">r i j = 1 â w i j â k:(i,k)âE (1 â w ik ) .<label>(2)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3">The Multi-Scalar Informativeness-Uniqueness Model</head><p>Inspired by the IP model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> for social network analysis, we propose the MSIU model to evaluate the informativeness and uniqueness of scalars in the multivariate domain. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 1</ref> shows the correspondence between the IP model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and our MSIU model. In our MSIU model, we take a PAGraph as the input graph, which corresponds to a social network in the IP model. Our MSIU model considers scalars as nodes, and edges are constructed based on association rules, which is analogous to the concept of Twitter users being nodes and retweeting relationships being edges in the IP model. The edge weight in our MSIU model is the confidence of the association rule, which corresponds to the ratio of retweets in the IP model. While popularity in the IP model is reflected by the number of followers, it is the probability of occurrence for a scalar in our MSIU model. The relations between informativeness and uniqueness can also be interpreted in the multivariate domain:</p><p>â¢ A scalar's informativeness depends on the number of scalars it infers as well as their uniqueness.</p><p>â¢ A scalar's informativeness depends on how reliably it infers the existence of other scalars compared to everyone else.</p><p>â¢ A scalar's uniqueness depends on the informativeness of those who it is exposed to but not informed by.</p><p>â¢ A scalar's uniqueness depends on how much it rejects other scalars' information compared to everyone else.</p><p>Given a pair of scalars in two different variables, the amount of information that flows from one scalar x i to another x j is x i 's confidence of inferring the existence of x j , which is measured by p(x j |x i ). Considering all possible associated scalars, the acceptance rate of x j with respect to x i is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">a i j = p(x j |x i ) â k:(k, j)âE p(x j |x k ) .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The acceptance rate in our MSIU model measures the amount of information that x j accepts from x i scaled by the total information accepted by x j from all its associated scalars in the PAGraph. Take <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> as an example: x j is informed by four other scalars, with confidence p(x j |x i ) = 0.6, p(x j |x k 4 ) = 0.7, p(x j |x k 5 ) = 0.8 and p(x j |x k 6 ) = 0.9, and hence we have a i j = 0.6/(0.6 + 0.7 + 0.8 + 0.9) = 0.2. The acceptance rate a i j reflects how much x i can infer the existence of x j competing with other x j 's neighbors who may also inform x j . In this example, although the information that flows from x i to x j is 60%, the relative information that x j accepts from x i is very small (20%) when considering all the associated scalars of x j . Such a relative measure is desired in our multivariate scenario as it takes all possible associations into account for quantifying the relative information that flows from one scalar to another. Given a pair of scalars in two different variables, the amount of information from x i that is rejected by x j is the chance of x j 's absence when x i is observed, which is measured by p</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(x j |x i ) = 1 â p(x j |x i ).</formula><p>Considering all possible associated scalars, the rejection rate of x j with respect to x i is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">r i j = 1 â p(x j |x i ) â k:(i,k)âE (1 â p(x k |x i )) = p(x j |x i ) â k:(i,k)âE (p(x k |x i ) .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The rejection rate in our MSIU model measures the amount of information that x j rejects from x i scaled by the total information from x i rejected by all its associated scalars in the PAGraph. In the example of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref>, we see that x i attempts to inform four other scalars, with re- Both acceptance rates and rejection rates in our MSIU model are used to obtain the relative informativeness and uniqueness that one scalar has in the entire PAGraph, based on the information flows modeled by the association rules. We employ the iterative scheme in the IP model <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> to compute the informativeness and uniqueness in our MSIU model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">jected information p(x j |x i ) = 1 â 0.6 = 0.4, p(x k 1 |x i ) = 1 â 0.2 = 0.8, p(x k 2 |x i ) = 1</formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">I i â â j:(i, j)âE a i j U j (5) U i â â j:( j,i)âE r ji I j<label>(6)</label></formula><p>In the initial state, the informativeness and uniqueness values are set to 1 for every scalar, and are iteratively updated as the information flows between pairs of scalars until convergence. At the end of each iteration, I i and P i are normalized to be within [0, 1] respectively. Romero et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> have shown that this iterative process converges in tens of iterations for even large graphs that have one million edges. Essentially, the informativeness and uniqueness are quantified based on how information is propagated between scalars of different variables. From equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, we see that a scalar x i is more informative if the following conditions hold: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> x i is associated with many other scalars of different variables; (2) the information of x i is highly accepted by the associated scalars (a i j is high); and/or (3) the associated scalars are unique (U j is high), which means that x i is able to infer the existence of scalars that are generally hard to be predicted.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">ASSOCIATION-GUIDED EXPLORATION FRAMEWORK</head><p>We combine our association analysis method with interactive visualization techniques to develop a framework for exploring scalar-level associations in multivariate data sets. In this section, we describe the design considerations and choices of our system interface, and provide guidelines for visual exploration using our framework. A supplementary video that accompanies this paper demonstrates our user interface and the exploration work flow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">User Interface</head><p>The user interface consists of three components: the PAGraph view, the multi-faceted PCP view, and the spatial view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">PAGraph View</head><p>The PAGraph view is to visualize the PAGraphs of confident associations between scalars of different variables. Because a PAGraph typically has over hundreds of nodes and thousands of edges, conventional node-link diagrams can suffer from visual cluttering due to node overlap and edge crossing. An alternative visualization is the adjacency matrix, which shows how nodes are connected together through the intersection of rows and columns. However, considering the sparsity of multidimensional data as well as the multi-partite property of PA-Graph, the PAGraph is often sparse and many display areas will be wasted in the corresponding adjacency matrix visualization. In searching the design space for visualizing directed graphs, we choose a radial graph visualization ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>): the scalars are arranged clockwise around a circle in an ascending order of the values, while the entire circle is divided into multiple segments for multiple variables (the scalars that do not have associations are omitted). Associations between scalars of different variables are drawn as curves connecting the associated scalars together. Each scalar node on the circle is colored by the its informativeness in a green-yellow-red order (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> for the color legend); and the color of an arc is consistent with one of the associated scalars to facilitate visual tracking. The boundaries between the scalars of different variables along the circle are marked by small line segments (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>.1).</p><p>In an initial PAGraph view <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 5a</ref>), the top confident associations are visible (10% by default), and users can adjust the edge density of the PAGraph to be shown in a control panel. Users can hover on a scalar node in the outermost circle of the PAGraph to view its confident associations, and a tooltip will pop up for showing the corresponding scalar value in focus <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 5c</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Multi-Faceted PCP View</head><p>With our analysis method, a scalar value (val.) now has three additional facets: informativeness (inf.), uniqueness (uni.) and probability (pro.). A multi-faceted view of scalars can reveal the relationships between the facets and prompt selecting scalars of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. To this end, we employ parallel coordinates plot (PCP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, with the following special design considerations:</p><p>Rank-based Axes. The density of polylines on a PCP axis is typically not uniform, due to the non-uniform distribution of data values. As a result of such overplotting, users may not be able to select a small portion of scalars of interest in dense areas through brushing <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. We transform the values on each axis into a rank space, where the position of a polyline on an axis shows the relative rank of the facet for the corresponding scalar. Since ranks are uniformly distributed on an axis, users can brush a small region for selecting a few scalars of interest <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 7.2)</ref>. By default the polylines are colored by their informativeness in a green-yellow-red order (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> for the color legend).</p><p>Juxtaposed Plots. To show the multi-ranks of scalars of multiple variables simultaneously, we employ the juxtaposition design <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, using multiple side-by-side PCPs -each PCP corresponds to multifaceted scalars of one variable <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 7.1)</ref>. Such juxtaposed plots allow users to focus on selecting an interesting value range in one variable, while still maintaining the information of the multi-ranks in other variables for switching the selection.</p><p>Cross-linked Views. In addition to standard brushing and linking across axes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, our design also supports brushing and linking across different variables -when users select scalars in the PCP of one variable through brushing, the top associated scalars of other variables are extracted from the PAGraph (10% by default), and are simultaneously highlighted in the other PCPs. Furthermore, these associations are also highlighted in the PAGraph view <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 7.2)</ref>. The values of the selected scalars are shown in a separate window so that users can understand and refine their selection. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3">Spatial View</head><p>While the PAGraph view and the PCP view together serves as the interactive interface for users to select scalars of interest and view their associations in detail, the spatial view provides users with the most direct and intuitive view of the data through volume rendering <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 7</ref>.3b and 7.3c) and isosurface visualization <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 7</ref>.3a). To design an automatic insightful transfer function that saves users' effort from the tedious and time-consuming manual specification, while also revealing the associations between scalars of different variables, we propose the following two schemes: Transfer Function with Average Associations. The informativeness and uniqueness of a scalar together reveals the association information about scalars of other variables in an average sense. Therefore, the transfer function that reflects average scalar-level associations takes one of the following options: opacity(in f ormativeness(x)), opacity(uniqueness(x)), or opacity(in f ormativeness(x) Ã uniqueness(x)). The corresponding volumes determined by these transfer functions are referred to as informative volume, unique volume, and informative and unique volume respectively, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>.</p><p>Transfer Function with Specific Associations. When users select a scalar of interest in the interface, in addition to showing the corresponding isosurface visualization <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 7.3a)</ref>, the associated volumes highlight the scalars of other variables that are associated with the selected scalar. Thus, for a given scalar x, the transfer function of its associated volume Y is set to opacity(p(y|x)). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>.3b and 7.3c present an example of two associated volumes with respect to a selected scalar.</p><p>Empirically, we use opacity( f (x)) = [ f (x)] 2 to emphasize the relatively high informative/unique scalars or the relatively confident associations. The color transfer function color(x) maps the scalar values in a blue-green-red order, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Exploration Guidelines</head><p>For a given multivariate data set, we assume that users already have some pre-selected variables in mind, as is often the case for domain scientists in real-world applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The task to address in this work is to explore scalars of interest in the given variables based on scalar-level associations. We follow the visualization mantra "Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand" by Ben Shneiderman <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> to guide the exploration process:</p><p>Overview first. The initial PCP and PAGraph views provide an overview of the multiple facets of scalars and their associations <ref type="figure">(Figure 8.1)</ref>. Users can select a variable from the PCP labels to initiate the spatial view with the informative/unique volume of the variable <ref type="figure">(Figure 8.2)</ref>.</p><p>Zoom and filter. To understand how scalars of other variables are associated with a particular scalar, users can select a scalar by brushing the PCP view and see the corresponding associations in the PA-Graph view. For instance, users can first brush the Inf./Uni. axis to selected a few informative/unique scalars, and then brush the Pro. axis to narrow down the focus to a particular scalar of interest (illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>.3 as well as in the supplementary video).</p><p>Details-on-demand. To gain insights into the spatial relationship of the selected scalar and its associated scalars of other variables, the spatial view shows the isosurface visualization of the selected scalar and its associated volumes of the other variables <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 8.4)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">RESULTS</head><p>We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through experiments on three representative multivariate data sets: Hurricane Isabel, Ionization Front Instability, and Turbulent Combustion. The experiments were conducted on a desktop machine with an Intel core i7-2600 CPU, 16 GB of RAM and an NVIDIA Geforce GTX 560 GPU with 2GB texture memory. The interactive exploration process in each experiment is demonstrated in the supplementary video that accompanies this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Case Study 1: Hurricane Isabel Data Set</head><p>The Hurricane Isabel data set is an atmospheric simulation created by the Weather Research and Forecast model, courtesy of the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the U.S. National Science Foundation. The resolution of the grid is 250 Ã 250 Ã 50 at each time step. To investigate the relationships between pressure, humidity and wind speed in the hurricane simulation, we selected the Pressure (PRE), Water Vapor Mixing Ratio (QVA) and Wind Velocity Magnitude (VEL) variables at time step 18 for our experiment on this data set. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>.1 presents the initial PCP view and PAGraph view of the selected variables. We started the exploration by selecting the PRE variable and examine the resulting informative/unique volumes, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>. We can see that the hurricane eye and eyewall structures are highlighted by the informative and unique PRE volume in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6c</ref>, which has low air pressure as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6f</ref>.</p><p>To understand how the PRE scalars interact with the scalars of the other variables QVA and VEL, we brushed the initial PCP view in  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>.2, we observe that a majority of the associated VEL scalars have high values. Meanwhile, we found that the selected PRE scalar is associated with high/medium QVA values that represent a decent amount of water vapor. When it comes to the spatial view in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>.3, we found that the isosurface PRE = -2674.17 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>.3a corresponds to the hurricane eyewall. The associated QVA volume in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>.3b presents the long bands of rain clouds that spiral inward to the hurricane eye, and the associated VEL volume in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>.3c highlights strong winds near the hurricane eyewall. In this sense, this informative PRE scalar with its associated QVA and VEL scalars presents a joint feature from multiple variables -the hurricane eyewall with strong wind and spiral rainbands.</p><p>As a follow-up comparison study, we select an uninformative scalar PRE = 141.61 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>.4. We see that this scalar mostly interacts with low VEL values and low QVA values. The green PCP polylines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>.4 imply that these associated scalar values are also uninformative. The spatial view in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>.5 further explains such associations: the isosurface PRE = 141.61 spreads out the entire spatial domain except around the hurricane eye <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 7.5a</ref>), which is associated with mostly low water vapor on the continent (the dark blue regions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>.5b) and weak wind faraway from the hurricane eye (the dark blue regions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>.5c).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Case Study 2: Ionization Front Instability Data Set</head><p>The Ionization Front Instability data set is a simulation created by Mike Norman and Daniel Whalen for investigating the effects of in-stabilities where radiation ionization fronts scatter around primordial gas in the formation of galaxies. Ionization front is a transition region where interstellar gas changes from a mostly neutral state to a mostly ionized state, which involves the abundances of many chemical species such as hydrogen and helium. The resolution of the grid is 300 Ã 124 Ã 124 at each time step. To investigate the dependency of the ionization process with respect to temperature, we selected the variables of H, H + (HP), He (HE), and Temperature (TEM) and time step 100 in our experiment.</p><p>For this data set, the initial PCP view and PAGraph view are presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>.1. We initiated our exploration with the informative and unique TEM volume in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>.2, determined by the transfer function opacity(in f ormativeness(x) Ã uniqueness(x)). We found that the TEM scalars around 10000K are highly informative and unique. We then select an informative and unique scalar TEM = 10588.16 in the PCP view in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>.1. From the updated PCP view and PAGraph view in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>.3, we can see that many scalars are associated with this temperature value. To examine how the selected chemical species react at this temperature 10588.16K, we resort to the spatial view of the associated volumes in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>.4b, 8.4c and 8.4d. It is obvious that the regions overlapping the isosurface TEM = 10588.16 in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>.4a are mostly highlighted, particularly in the associated H and HP volumes. According to the studies of hydrogen ionization <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, 10000K is roughly the temperature where a majority of neutral hydrogen become ionized hydrogen. Furthermore, we also explored uninformative TEM scalars from the PCP view in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>.1, which have very high temperature values. No confident associations (top 10%) were found between those uninformative scalars and the H/HP/HE scalars (the resulting PCP and PAGraph views are not shown due to the lack of space).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Case Study 3: Turbulent Combustion Data Set</head><p>The Turbulent Combustion data set is a combustion simulation produced by Dr. Jacqueline Chen at Sandia Laboratories through US Department of Energy's SciDAC Institute for Ultrascale Visualization. The resolution of the grid for each time step is 240 Ã 360 Ã 60. The Mixture Fraction (MIX) variable in this data set, ranging from 0 (pure oxidizer) to 1 (pure fuel), signifies the proportion of fuel and oxidizer and generally reflects the characteristics of the flame: when the chemical reaction rate is greater than the turbulent mixing rate, a complete burning is indicated (the scalar MIX = 0.42 corresponds to a complete burning as reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>); weak or extinguished burning occurs when the turbulent mixing rate exceeds the chemical reaction rate. As the characteristics of local combustion also depends on the Heat Release Rate (HR) and Mass Fraction of the Hydroxyl Radical (OH) from the neighboring flame elements, we are interested in exploring scalar-level associations of the MIX, HR and OH variables. We have selected time step 65 to conduct our experiment.</p><p>The initial PCP view and PAgraph view are presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 1.</ref>1. From the PCP view, we observe that the most informative MIX scalars lie in the middle range of MIX. Since flames typically burn in a balanced mixture of fuel and oxidizer (either pure oxidizer or pure fuel will result in extinction of reaction), we expect these informative MIX scalars correspond to the burning flame regions, which strongly interact with scalars of the HR and OH variables. The informative MIX volume in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> To investigate the associations between the MIX scalars and the scalars of the other variables HR and OH, two specific MIX scalars that have contrast informativeness have been selected in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.3 and 1.4 respectively. The linked PAGraph view in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.3 highlights a lot of associations with MIX = 0.4998, which we expect to represent a burning flame. From the linked PCP view of OH in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.3, we see that a majority of the associated OH scalars have high values. This is consistent with the fact that the highly convoluted flame regions often have rapid radical diffusion rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Similarly, we found that the scalar MIX = 0.4998 is associated with many low (negative) HR values that represent high heat release rates. In contrast, an uninformative scalar MIX = 0.0062 in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.4, which we expect to be a weakly burning region due to the lack of fuel, has only a few associations. From the linked PCP views of OH and HR in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.4, we found that the associated scalars are low OH values and high HR values. This indicates that weakly or extinguished burning regions often have low radical diffusion rates and low heat conduction rates. The spatial views in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.5 and 1.6 confirmed our findings: the associated HR/OH volume mostly overlaps with the flame structure represented by the isosurface MIX = 0.4998, while the isosurface MIX = 0.0062 presents two outer layers in the spatial domain that is far away from the strong flame region, and the associated HR/OH volumes highlight the regions that are either outer layers (where oxidizer is too high) or inner layers (where fuel is too high).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>The MSIU model brings a novel perspective to visual exploration of multivariate data sets. Previous correlations methods include correlation coefficients, mutual information, gradient-based measures, etc. Compared to these approaches, our method has two major differences: (1) the MSIU model takes into account the associations of scalars, which are the more specific relationships between variables. These scalar-level associations reveal complex interactions between scalars of different variables, and can be used to classify the scalars in terms of their informativeness and uniqueness; (2) our approach can easily cope with more than two variables, as the MSIU model constructs a multipartite association graph that captures the relationships of scalars in the given variables. In contrast, existing correlation approaches mostly focus on the relationships of two variables, and the extension to more than two variables is often non-trivial.</p><p>The association graph with the informativeness and uniqueness learned from the MSIU model is used for volume rendering that encodes the relationships between scalars in one variable and scalars of the other variables. This unique property differentiates our method from many existing multi-dimensional transfer function design approaches, as they usually map a multidimensional vector to a single color and opacity for describing all the variables, sometimes with additional derived variables. Consequently, it can be difficult to understand the different contributions of individual variables regarding the multivariate interactions. Our association-aware transfer functions, encoding the average or specific associations, are automatically created for each variable respectively. Therefore, the scalars in the spatial view have their intrinsic physical properties based on the semantics of the underlying variable.</p><p>Our method works well for multivariate data sets where scalars of different variables co-occur, as shown in the three case studies. As stated in Section 5.2, we assume that users already have some preselected variables in mind prior to the exploration in real world scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and our method has been applied to several variables of interest in each case study respectively. Although one can consider all the variables simultaneously, it can be very difficult to interpret the relationships between a scalar and scalars of a large number of variables. In contrast, pair-wise association or a small number of multivariate associations are more intuitive and easier to understand. The trade-off between multivariate complexity and interpretability needs to be better  understood in the future. All the computations in the MSIU algorithm are done in the preprocessing stage prior to the exploration process. One parameter in the MSIU algorithm is the choice of bin size N, which is related to the discretization of scalar values and the calculation of probability distributions. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 2</ref> reports the computational performance of the MSIU algorithm with different number of bins. We also examined the relative ranks of informativeness and uniqueness when using different numbers of bins. It is observed that a majority of the relative ranks of informativeness and uniqueness remained the same for different numbers of bins with minor variations in all three data sets. Due to space constraint, we only report the comparison results for the Hurricane Isabel data set ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 9</ref>). While we used 128 bins in this work, in the future we would like to experiment with non-uniform discretization as well as multi-level discretization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we present a novel association analysis method to guide visual exploration of scalar-level associations in multivariate data sets. We model the directional interactions between scalars as information flows based on association rules. We introduce the concepts of informativeness and uniqueness to describe how information flows between scalars of different variables and how they are associated with each other in the multivariate domain. Based on scalar-level associations represented by a probabilistic association graph, we transform the problem of identifying informative and unique scalars into a network analysis problem of finding influential and passive people in social networks, and propose the Multi-Scalar Informativeness-Uniqueness (MSIU) algorithm. We develop an exploration framework with multiple interactive views to explore the scalars of interest with confident associations in the spatial domain, and provide guidelines for visual exploration using our framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies in three application domains.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>An illustration of PAGraphs for multivariate data sets (distinct colors are used for nodes from different variables).

The rejection rate r i j assesses how much x j rejects x i 's information compared to other x i 's neighbors who may also reject x i 's information.

We now analyze the time complexity of the MSIU algorithm. For a data set of M variables Ã K data points, 1D histograms and 2D joint histograms can be computed in O(MK + M(M â 1)K) time. Assuming the number of bins in each scalar range is N, the PAGraph can be constructed in O(M(M â 1)N 2 ). Computing the acceptance rates and rejection rates takes O(|V | + |E|) time. The iterative computation of informativeness and uniqueness values takes O(c(|V | + |E|)), where c is the total number of iterations. According to Romero et al. [23], c is a small number since the iterative process converges very quickly. Since |V | is upper-bounded by MN, and the number of edges |E| is upper-bounded by M(M â 1)N 2 (|E| is often much smaller than M(M â 1)N 2 due to the sparsity of multidimensional data), overall the MSIU algorithm takes O(MK + M(M â 1)K + c(MN + M(M â 1)N 2 )) time.</figDesc></figure>
