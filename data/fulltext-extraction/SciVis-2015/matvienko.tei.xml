<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The domain of flow field visualizations is one of the great success stories of scientific visualization. Practically all engineering and natural sciences benefit from this work. Consequently, a wide variety of specific techniques have been developed and improved over the last few decades.</p><p>Within the realm of available vector field visualization methods, there is a number of distinct subareas. One of those subareas is dense vector field visualization. Dense vector field visualization techniques in general are known for their ability to give an excellent quick overview of the entire vector field.</p><p>The most prominent method for dense vector field visualization is the Line Integral Convolution (LIC) method presented by Cabral and Leedom <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This basic method has been analyzed and improved in a large number of publications (see Section 2 for details). Though the basic concept behind many extensions to LIC remains the same, the performance and quality of the resulting visualizations has been significantly improved. The well-known basic concept is for each pixel to use a convolution of a well-chosen noise signal along the flow with a convolution kernel, such as a Gaussian. This operation creates a coherent pattern along the flow while producing little coherence perpendicular to the flow.</p><p>An inherent property of this approach is that the result exposes some of the features of the underlying noise. In some works it has been successfully utilized for transferring additional information by means of noise spatial frequency. However, the randomness, introduced by the input, does not serve any particular visualization purpose. The questions we want to address in this paper are whether a noticeable amount of noise is a necessary ingredient for dense flow visualization (DFV) and whether there are options better than altering the noise injection scheme to control such visualization characteristics as spatial frequency and contrast.</p><p>A recent heuristic approach to DFV by Matvienko and Krüger <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> suggests that the explicit presence of the input noise can be avoided, although at a high computational cost. In this work we suggest a more intuitive and perception-motivated approach, based on the popular LIC algorithm, offering better frequency control with efficiency comparable to LIC. We call this new method Orthogonally Gabor-Enhanced Repetitive LIC or OGR LIC for short. The idea is to consider the traditional LIC from the point of view of integral operators in the local flow-aligned coordinates, which allows us to extend it with Gabor kernels, understanding the implications in the frequency domain. Then, we take spatial frequency-oriented visualization a step further, demonstrating how single-frequency images can constitute a basis for richer adaptive multi-frequency flow visualizations. In summary, the key features of our method are:</p><p>• dense noise-insensitive flow visualization • adaptive spatial frequency control • perceptional motivation • straightforward mathematical formulation • straightforward implementation, reusing the LIC procedure • run-time efficiency • few, intuitive parameters</p><p>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 we place our approach within the context of the existing work on dense flow visualization and relevant visualization research, discussing the available means of frequency control in LIC images and the applications of Gabor functions in visualization.</p><p>In Section 3 we present our technique in detail. Starting with a fresh look at the LIC method reformulated as an integral operator, we analyze its frequency spectrum in Section 3.1 and extend it with Gabor filtering in the direction orthogonal to the flow for powerful frequency control in Section 3.2. Finally, in Section 4 we demonstrate how frequency-filtered images can be combined to achieve a novel type of visualization and discuss the results, followed by the conclusion and the insights on future work directions in Sections 7-6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>In this section we briefly review the dense flow visualization methods related to our work, and the role of Gabor filters in visualization and perception.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Line Integral Convolution</head><p>The method described in this paper falls into the category of dense vector field visualization, one of four categories of flow visualization: direct, texture-based, geometric, and feature-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> or one of five according to the state-of-the-art report of Salzbrunn et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, who also include partition-based techniques. For details on methods other than dense flow visualization techniques, we refer the interested reader to one of these state-of-the-art reports. In the remainder of this section, we focus on dense flow visualization.</p><p>The first method to demonstrate the power of dense flow visualization was the pioneering work on Spot Noise by Van Wijk <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Only two years later, Cabral and Leedom introduced the Line Integral Convolution (LIC) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Since then, texture-based methods have proven to be effective flow analysis tools in a wide variety of fields. Forssell <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> extended the method to arbitrary surfaces and Rezk-Salama et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> demonstrated its use in 3D. Stalling and Hege <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, as well as Stalling in his thesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, performed a thorough analysis of the influence of various LIC parameters on the signal-processing level. Weiskopf <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> demonstrated a fast GPU implementation.</p><p>An important aspect of the research on LIC is iterative application, proposed by Okada and Lane <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> for improving the visual quality of the method. This idea was later revised by Weiskopf <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> and Hlawatsch et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, mainly in the context of performance optimization. Our technique utilizes intense iterative low-and high-pass filtering to suppress the features of the original noise input completely, thus resulting in a visualization with controlled frequency characteristics. As the above list suggests, a significant amount of work in dense flow visualization has been focused on extensions to the LIC method. There are also a few methods based on different algorithms. Examples include Taponecco and Alexa's work <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> on vector field visualization with Markov random fields and Van Wijk's image-based flow visualization method <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Multi-frequency Noise for Dense Flow Visualization</head><p>There have been efforts to adaptively control frequency in DFV images with multi-frequency noise for various practical purposes, including extra scalar value mapping, level of detail control, and uncertainty visualization.</p><p>The fact that the result of LIC filtering depends not only on the input flow, but also on the input texture, was recognized and used for visualization purposes soon after the introduction of the original LIC algorithm. Kiu and Banks <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> suggested using noise with locally varying spatial frequency to enhance perception by mapping noise frequency to the flow velocity magnitude.</p><p>This approach was then utilized for LIC on surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, to compensate for texture distortions due to a varying level of detail. The original schema using LIC with multi-frequency noise was further revised by Urness et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, who suggested the texture stitching technique, which combines the output of LIC applied to several separate noise textures featuring different noise scales. That is, the spatially varying frequency is achieved after LIC, not before, as in the approach of Kiu and Banks. We use a variation of this idea with our technique in Section 4.2.</p><p>The spatial frequency control is a very important topic in unsteady flow visualization. The main issue here is the low-pass filtering that consistently destroys high-frequency components of the advected texture over time. Up to this point, the efforts have been concentrated on the preservation of the spectrum of input texture <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. An interesting two-phase scheme has been recently proposed withing the dynamic LIC approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. It consists of generating for each frame the time-coherent high-frequent noise texture by tracing particles along the streamline evolution trajectories (which is given as an independent flow) in the first stage, followed by ordinary LIC afterwards. In our method we suggest a constructive way not to preserve, but to enforce the desirable spatial frequencies in the resulting images.</p><p>The recent applications of multi-frequency noise are connected to the rising interest in uncertain flows <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. The noise frequency here is in inverse proportion to the uncertainty, resulting in blurred regions in visualization where high error is expected. One common property of the above methods is that the varying noise frequency is obtained by smoothing a high-frequency texture, thus effectively achieving varying noise scale, but not concerning its orientation. Recent work on Gabor noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> demonstrates how a noise texture with specific spatial frequency and orientation can be generated, with the means of Gabor functions in the context of computer graphics applications.</p><p>In the next section we briefly discuss the role of Gabor functions in visualization and human perception, motivating their choice for frequency-control filtering in our method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Gabor Filters in Visualization and Perception</head><p>The extensive literature on human perception suggests that the human visual system processes spatial information by means of arrays of neurons that can be modeled with Gabor functions. This model of the visual cortex edge detection mechanisms accounts for a large variety of experimental results <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. An important feature of the Gabor functions is that they, having a localized distribution (Gaussian shape), jointly optimize the sensitivity in frequency and spatial domains, which is a property believed to hold for the human visual system as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The idea is that human vision examines frequency and orientation on a local basis, by a windowed rather than by a global Fourier transform. Ware and Knight <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, in their pioneering work on texture-based visualization using the Gabor model, formulate three fundamental dimensions of texture: frequency or size, contrast, and orientation. These dimensions can be used to transfer information and are measured by 2D Gabor filters. In flow visualization, the properties of Gabor functions for measuring local frequency and orientation were exploited in the work of Jänicke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, which introduces a quality metric for DFV images. This metric relies on the ability of Gabor filters to extract the perceived flow direction from the visualization image. The conventional 2D Gabor filters are products of the Gaussian filtering in one dimension and 1D Gabor filtering in the other direction. In our work, we utilize 1D Gabor filters to enforce a particular frequency in the direction orthogonal to the flow, combined with ordinary LIC Gaussian filtering along the flow, resulting in a 2D filter, analogous to the 2D gabor filters in perception and visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Flow Visualization With Explicit Frequency Control</head><p>The work presented in this paper can be seen as an extension of LIC. Furthermore, recently, a visually similar but conceptually different approach to dense flow visualization with consistent frequency pattern has been suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The underlying idea is to compute an integral curve per pixel, but instead of the convolution with a noise signal, using it to compute a pairwise heuristic distance between pixels and thereby compute wave interference patterns.</p><p>Analogous to this technique, we use the complex exponentials and iterated filtering as basic building blocks of our method. However, employing a completely different process allows us to achieve significant improvement over its predecessor. OGR LIC differs from the previously presented method in the following features:</p><p>• It admits an intuitive representation in terms of the widely adopted LIC procedure by plugging in appropriate kernels. This avoids the introduction of additional heuristics. • The choice of filtering kernels has a solid motivation in perceptional studies and is related to flow visualization metrics. • The filtered images feature less deviation from the original flow, requiring a fraction of the computational cost of the predecessor (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).</p><p>Moreover, in this paper we provide an extended discussion on how the frequency-filtered output of our method can be further used to achieve flow visualizations with multiple controlled frequencies, including locally adaptive frequency, and address the issues in the perception of high contrast.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHOD DESCRIPTION</head><p>In this work we suggest a technique for dense flow visualization with finer spatial frequency management than is feasible with noisebased approaches. The common feature of many available dense flow visualization methods can be described as low image variation in the direction of the flow and at the same time high variation in the orthogonal direction. This perception-related principle is also acknowledged by existing DFV quality metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. The source of variation in both directions in LIC output is the input texture, smoothed in one direction by the convolution kernel. Thus, for example, changing the scale of the input noise (for the overview of methods using multi-frequency noise see Section 2.2) affects both directions in the output, whereas an independent control is desirable. Moreover, altering a noise generation scheme admits only indirect spatial frequency control, which is non-linearly affected by the posterior filtering. In this work we address the spatial frequencies directly in the visualization image.</p><p>One novel idea of this work is, to the best of our knowledge, to explicitly consider and manipulate the frequency characteristics of the visualization image in both directions: along and orthogonal to the flow. We avoid the variation in the direction of the flow originating from noise, yet maintain high contrast and variation in the second direction (in static images) or on the contrary enforce a periodic wave pattern along the flow (in the animations as in Section 4.3). Gabor filters are the natural choice for implementation of this idea. These filters constitute the building blocks of the short-term Fourier transform and have a long-standing perceptual motivation (see Section 2.3). This approach allows us to control all three dimensions of the information visualization texture model, suggested by Ware and Knight <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>-contrast, frequency and direction-avoiding the randomness introduced by noise injection.</p><p>Our approach is based on the commonly adopted LIC scheme and in order to explain its technical side we first need to describe the generic framework we use for analysis of LIC in terms of directional frequencies. We take a view at LIC as an integral operator in coordinates tangential and normal to the flow and explore its spectrum in these coordinates. Then, we extend traditional LIC adding Gabor filtering orthogonal to the flow direction and consider the resulting spectrum, thus obtaining an analog of 2D Gabor filter. We demonstrate, that high-contrast frequency-bounded images can be obtained with several iterations of these kernels combined with restoration of the energy lost in each filtering step. In Section 4 we demonstrate how a combination of this images can result in interesting and novel visualizations and discuss possible issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">LIC as an Integral Operator in R 2</head><p>We consider LIC as an image filter applied to some noise image, staying in the continuous setting throughout our analysis for simplicity. Formally, a continuous formulation of an image filtering with a LIC kernel can be described as an integral transform of the image f (x, y) into the image g(x, y) with (x, y) ∈ Ω ⊂ R 2 . Such a transform is formulated in the most general form with Equation 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">g(x, y) = Ω f (x , y )K(x, y, x , y )dx dy (1)</formula><p>where K(x, y, x , y ) is some operator kernel that is specific to the operator. For our purpose it is convenient to define the LIC operator in curvilinear coordinates, instead of the more commonly used Cartesian coordinates. We introduce the curvilinear coordinates ξ = u(x, y) in the direction tangential to the flow at every given point (x, y) and η = v(x, y) orthogonal to the flow at this point. The new coordinates then are defined in the domain Ω ⊂ R 2 Note that we use this coordinate system merely for convenience of analysis. The actual implementation does not require explicit construction of curvilinear grids. Further, we deal with the integral transform in Equation 1 in the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">g(x, y) = Ω f (ξ , η)K lic (x, y, ξ , η)dξ dη (2)</formula><p>where the LIC kernel K lic already accounts for the coordinate transformation. The traditional LIC operator based on a Gaussian kernel G σ 2 with standard deviation σ can be described by plugging the K lic kernel into Equation 2. K lic is specified by Equation 3 and Equation 4.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">K lic (x, y, ξ , η) = G σ 2 (u(x, y) − ξ )δ (v(x, y) − η)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>or, denoting η 0 = v(x, y) and ξ 0 = u(x, y)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">K lic (x, y, ξ , η) = G σ 2 (ξ 0 − ξ )δ (η − η 0 )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>In the previous two equations, δ (t) is a Dirac delta pulse. Now, Equation 2 can be written as a separable convolution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">g(ξ 0 , η 0 ) = η 2 η 1 ξ 2 ξ 1 f (ξ , η)G σ 2 (ξ 0 − ξ )δ (η − η 0 )dξ dη (5)</formula><p>or, in a shorter notation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">g(ξ 0 , η 0 ) = [[ f (ξ , η) * G σ 2 (ξ )](ξ 0 , η) * δ (η)](η 0 , ξ 0 )</formula><p>, where * denotes a convolution. Thus, the LIC operator can be seen as a separable convolution in the coordinates tangential and orthogonal to the flow. In other words, the 2D filtering can be reduced to sequential application of two 1D filters. The horizontal direction denotes the frequency in the direction tangential to the vector field corresponding to coordinate ξ . The vertical direction denotes the frequency orthogonal to the vector field corresponding to coordinate η. The LIC kernel spectrum is a Gaussian centered around zero frequency changing only in ξ independent of η. The Gabor kernel spectrum is a Gaussian centered around a certain (user-selected) frequency changing only in η independent of ξ . The spectrum of the convolution of both filters in the spatial domain is a multiplication of their spectra.</p><p>This observation allows us to intuit the effect of this operator in the frequency domain. Application of the Fourier transform 1 F to the operator provides a comprehensive representation of its result in terms of the amount of energy contained in frequencies l along and q across the flow. The Fourier transform F for the LIC-filtered image g in the coordinates l and q is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">F {g}(l, q) = F { f (ξ , η)}(l, q) • F {G σ 2 (ξ )}(l) • F {δ (η)}(q) = F { f (ξ , η)}(l, q) • G σ −2 (l) (since F {δ (η)} = 1).</formula><p>Here and later we consider the Gaussians up to the normalization factors. This equation states that LIC performs a low-pass filtering in the direction tangential to the flow with Gaussian G σ −2 independently of the frequency in the orthogonal direction, illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2a</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Extending LIC With Gabor Filtering</head><p>As we have seen, Line Integral Convolution can be generalized as a basic framework composed of two filters: in the direction of the flow and orthogonal to it. Furthermore, our insight is that the frequencydomain implications of the particular choice of these filters can guide the visualization design. The original LIC performs one-dimensional smoothing in the local flow-aligned direction, resulting in an image spectrum, centered around zero frequency. We demonstrate how an image, centered around any specific spatial frequency, can be obtained with iterative Gabor filtering. This process, which we call OGR LIC, is our contribution to the toolbox of visualization methods.</p><p>Apart from their strong perceptional motivation (see Section 2.3), the Gabor functions are the natural choice for picking up a particular frequency due to their unique spectral characteristics: the Fourier transform of a Gabor filter is a Gaussian, centered around the chosen frequency. Due to this property, Gabor functions are suitable for local-frequency analysis, forming the basis for the windowed Fourier transform.</p><p>Formally, a one-dimensional Gabor filter with the wavelength λ and angle θ is defined as W (t) = G σ 2 (t)e i(2πλ −1 t+θ ) . We set θ = 0 since we are interested in only one direction.</p><p>Using the notation of the operator framework, presented in the previous section, the Gabor kernel orthogonal to the flow can be defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">K gb (x, y, ξ , η) = W (η 0 − η)δ (ξ − ξ 0 ) Generally a 2D</formula><p>Gabor filter is a combination of 1D Gabor filter in one direction and a Gaussian filter in the orthogonal direction. The filtering operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Formally, a windowed Fourier transform such as a Gabor transform is to be considered, but we intend to keep the exposition as straightforward as possible, leaving the construction of a consistent mathematical theory out of the scope of the current work. We do strive to provide an intuition with enough details for practical applications of the presented ideas.</p><p>we suggest consists of the LIC (Gaussian)smoothing along the flow and the Gabor filtering orthogonal to the flow. It is described by Equation 6:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">g = f * K lic * K gb (6)</formula><p>Or in the frequency domainF {g}(l,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">q) = F { f }(l, q) • G σ −2 1 (l) • [G σ −2 2 (q) * δ (q − λ −1 )](q) = F { f }(l, q) • G σ −2 1 (l) • G σ −2 2 (q − λ −1 ) since F {G σ 2 2 (t) • e i2πλ −1 t } = G σ −2 2 (q) * δ (q − λ −1 ) and h(q) * δ (q − z) = h(q − z)</formula><p>for any function h(q). Here σ 1 and σ 2 are the standard deviations of the LIC and Gabor filters. Thus, our new filter performs a low-pass filtering in the direction of the flow and band pass filtering in the orthogonal direction, centered around frequency λ −1 . Visually this filtering corresponds to alternating black and white lines of thickness λ . We describe the resulting images as being centered around a certain frequency or frequencybounded. The spectrum of the filters is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2b</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2c</ref>. The same plot as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2c</ref> represents the spectrum of a 2D Gabor filter used the texture model of Ware and Knight <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> and other common applications except for the different coordinate system (Cartesian instead of flow aligned in our model). In fact, for a locally constant flow these types of filters are identical.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Implementation Details</head><p>Using the framework described above, we suggest the following filtering process: starting from a random input image, we apply the discussed filters in two passes. Due to the associative nature of convolution, the kernels in Equation 6 can be applied in a sequence one after the other. We first run an ordinary LIC shader (i.e., a convolution with a Gaussian). Then, we rotate the vector field by π 2 and run the same shader on the output of the previous pass with a Gabor kernel instead of a Gaussian. To achieve a consistent smooth line pattern, several iterations of the described procedure (normally 15 -20) are sufficient. However, it is important to take into account the contrast normalization between iterations. This problem can be described as energy (contrast) loss in the processed image due to filtering. In the frequency domain, the filter multiplies all frequencies with a Gaussian, thus decreasing the energy of the resulting image. There are several ways to restore the energy in the original range. One can rescale the image values on each iteration, use histogram equalization transform, or even apply a binary threshold. We believe the best contrast normalization effect is achieved with the following method. We start from a random complex image z normalized such that |z| = 1. We perform our computation in complex numbers, and after each three iterations of filtering divide the resulting image z by |z | in each pixel. This simple operation produces an image with the same total energy as |z|. The result is then either the real or imaginary part of the complex image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">METHOD APPLICATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS</head><p>In this section we first illustrate the visual effect of OGR LIC method, applying it to a number of representative vector fields. Then, we discuss possible approaches how the textures synthesized by our method could be further used as components for effective flow visualizations.</p><p>The example images and vector fields are sampled at a 512 2 grid and are computed in 20 iterations of Gaussian and Gabor filters. For the example images please refer to the supplementary material. The first set of images in <ref type="figure">Figure 1demonstrates</ref> our method in a number of vector fields. For comparison, we paired each image with a LIC visualization of the same flow field. The second set of images in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2depicts</ref> the same vector field visualized with different frequencies. The third set of images in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3shows</ref> our method applied to the same flow field a number of times with varying noise to demonstrate the invariance of the desired frequency with respect to the input noise. In the rightmost image of this figure, we used uniform gray with only 10 arbitrarily placed white pixels as input. Even in this extreme case, OGR LIC converges to a result similar to the other images, although it does require more iterations (100 instead of 20). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4demonstrates</ref> the distortion of color brightness, due to noise in LIC images combined with color-coding, compared to OGR LIC output.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Contrast In Bounded-Frequency Images</head><p>One important aspect we need to address concerning the images with one central frequency is the contrast perception. It can be observed that high spatial frequencies combined with high contrast have a disturbing effect, especially when being looked at for a long time. The left image in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> demonstrates an extreme case of this problem. In this respect, the original LIC images that have a wide frequency spectrum and relatively low contrast are more comfortable to look at. Before we identify the source of additional visual stress arising from these images and suggest a remedy, we would like to note that high-contrast bounded-frequency images are not themselves necessarily the target visualization, but rather are a useful building block for producing novel effective visualizations. In this and the following sections, we discuss how to benefit from the advantages of frequency control and at the same time avoid the downsides of the high-frequency, high-contrast visualization.</p><p>Importantly, several decades of contrast perception studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> suggest that the human contrast sensitivity (the reciprocal of the threshold contrast) is a function of the frequency of the visual signal. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> demonstrates the sensitivity to different spatial frequencies at the same amplitude level, suggesting that the sensitivity to a particular image can be decreased by either decreasing or increasing the spatial frequency. However, the latter option is hardly feasible with finite-resolution displays due to the Nyquist limit. The highfrequency OGR LIC images, falling in the vicinity of the peak of the curve in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>, thus require much less amplitude to achieve the same ratio to threshold contrast than the lower-frequency images (e.g., generated by traditional LIC), represented by the left end of the curve. One option to avoid the disturbing effect of the highfrequency high-contrast images is to rescale the gray values to a smaller range, effectively decreasing the amplitudes closer to the threshold contrast range. Consider the resulting change in perception in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. In the next section we suggest a more practical solution, which combines contrast reduction with additional frequency injection, leading to adaptive frequency control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Frequency Combination</head><p>Apart from just reducing the amplitude of the images, we suggest a comparably simple, yet much more powerful technique: blending   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref> illustrate this idea. An important additional benefit of the resulting visualizations compared to the single-frequency centric images is that line splittings, which are noticeable in the "pure" frequency images, are almost completely indistinguishable in the "mixed" frequency version. In particular this results in reduced average angular error (AAE), as the evaluation results in Section 5 indicate. The local frequency was identified to be one of the fundamental informationtransferring texture dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. There have been efforts to adaptively control frequency in LIC images with multi-frequency noise for various applications, including uncertain flow visualization and additional parameter mapping (see Section 2.2). Our approach, compared to noise-based solutions, avoids introducing high frequencies along the flow and allows more control over frequencies in the orthogonal direction. The locally adaptive frequency can be achieved easily using a mask when blending frequency-oriented images, as demonstrated in the supplementary material <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. The mask provides the weight of a certain frequency image in each pixel. That is, first using OGR LIC, we compute images centered around different frequencies and then form one visualization image as a weighted sum of these input images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Animation and Unsteady Flow</head><p>Here we consider two scenarios that describe how our technique can be used for flow animation. First of all, we would like to note that the low-pass filtering in the flow direction is not necessarily a prerequisite for the visualization. Instead, using a Gabor filter along the flow can serve visualization purposes. The original Cabral and Leedom paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> mentions that LIC can be animated by shifting the phase of a periodic kernel. A frequency-oriented view of these images allows us to combine images with specific frequencies both along and across the flow. The animation of checkerboard-like flowing patterns can be generated by incrementing the phase of the waves in the direction of the flow. The achieved visual effect is similar to the recent geometric approach to streamline animation of Yeh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> in the supplementary material illustrates how one frame of such an animation can be computed. In the frequency-oriented images filtered only along the flow, the sharp edges aligned with the flow allow to distinguish separate flow-aligned bands visualizing the flow structure. At the same time the presence of these edges can be confusing, since they do not represent any specific flow structures and thus is a drawback of this method.</p><p>Another visualization scenario is the application of the OGR LIC method to unsteady flow. For each animation frame, the target visualizations are instantaneous streamlines. This approach, though not free from limitations has found its applications in several problem domains. Among the most advanced implementations is the work of Jobard and Lefer <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The method has particular value for magnetic field visualization, where one proposed texture-based implementation is the dynamic LIC of Sundquist <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>Our approach is not subject to the loss of high-frequent components of the visualization with time, since the resulting image is not directly dependent on the input texture. For this reason we do not need to regenerate the input noise for each frame, as in dynamic LIC. However, the independent computation of animation frames creates a disturbing flickering effect in the vortex cores along their movement.</p><p>In order to achieve the temporal consistency between frames, we employ basic LIC filtering along the streamline motion field. In the work of Sundquist this motion field is introduced a second vector field that describes the evolution of streamlines. It can be available as an independent input for some applications. We suggest a scheme to construct this field using basic vortex tracking. For each frame we compute a feature map, corresponding to the commonly used λ 2 vortex criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> to capture the vortex region's structure. In the next step we apply the optical flow algorithm of Horn and Schunk <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> to estimate the direction of the vortex movement in space-time. We apply line integral convolution with a Gaussian kernel along this flow (across frames) in addition to the Gaussian smoothing along the original flow and the Gabor filtering orthogonal to flow (within frame). A limitation of our implementation is that still a significant amount of oscillation persists in higher-frequency visualization in the regions close to the vortex cores, which can be distractive.</p><p>Our observation is that the most coherent visualizations are achieved using low Gabor frequencies (below f Nyquist / 8) and the kernel lengths chosen in proportion 2:1:2 for filtering along the flow, orthogonal to the flow, and across the frames. The obtained results show time-coherence of streamline and vortex colors between subsequent frames (see the submitted video).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">EVALUATION</head><p>In this section we conduct a statistical evaluation of the OGR LIC method using visual reconstructability of the underlying flow as a criterion. We compare LIC, OLIC and two variations of our method to each other using this metric. The effect of frequency control is evident from the visualization images; however the accuracy of the underlying flow representation still requires verification. Our goal is to position our work against prior art and in particular compare it with LIC as it is naturally the closest analog. Our expectation is that with OGR LIC it is possible to produce at least as accurate flow representations using only a limited frequency bandwidth.</p><p>There has been a great deal of research on the evaluation of general flow visualization effectiveness including user studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> and mathematical models and metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. A viable approach would be a user study, which, however, comes at the price that it is tied to a specific visualization purpose (or task conducted by participants) and influenced by individual subject preferences. It is also harder than automated evaluation to reproduce on a large scale. As we do not have a specific user task in mind we are concerned with the introduced directional error compared to closely related texture-based methods (LIC, OLIC).</p><p>For these reasons we decided in favor of a combination of quality metric computations with the methods of statistical inference in order to make general statements about the method. An important limitation of such evaluation compared to perceptional experiment is that such a purely technical measure can give an insight on how much original directional information is preserved in the image, but not how accessible this information to the human. So, the output of the evaluation is then the assessment of the accuracy of representation, not the ultimate usefulness of the visualization, which might be addressed in a subsequent user study. Other limitation of our image-based approach to evaluation is that a great body of research on geometric 2D flow visualization is left behind. In particular, several prominent even streamline placement methods (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>) allow to achieve similar visualizations. With certain additional assumptions (on flow direction interpolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>), the error metric we employ can be generalized for comparison image-based to geometric methods. Combined with streamline rendering adjusted in such a way that thickness of streamlines is close to the distance between streamlines, the obtained streamline visualizations have been reported to yield a better score than LIC under this metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Although these methods also have other advantages over texturebased flow visualization (e.g., better control over magnitude), a fair comparison of geometric approach to texture-based is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>We suggest a more focused evaluation setup, comparing the error introduced in 3 specific implementations within the same LIC filtering framework (LIC, OLIC, OGR LIC). As a quality score we choose a metric suggested by Jänicke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The main advantage of this metric for our purpose is that it is not highly sensitive to contrast (as opposed to <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> for instance) and we do not want high contrast of OGR LIC by itself to give a preference to our method. The approach of Jänicke et al. consists in extracting the flow direction from the visualization image using a standard 2D Gabor filter bank (which only difference to our model in that is not aligned with the flow). The extracted direction is then compared against the actual flow direction by the computation of the average angular error (AAE). Thus, the ultimate score is the measure of similarity between the original flow and the flow reconstructed from visualization. As a minor technical simplification of the original algorithm, we consider the average angular error among all pixels, instead of introducing a threshold on the minimal considered filter response and further interpolation of the sparse values. In other words we avoid making a decision about the relevance of different pixels to the whole visualization.</p><p>With this quality evaluation method at our disposal, we do statistical inference for the mean value of the sample of the randomly generated vector fields. Our statistical simulation is as follows. We generate 100 random flows, using only a uniformly distributed flow direction, since the flow magnitude does not affect either our method or LIC. The resulting flows are chaotic, and in order to ensure that flow features are representable, we choose the visualization image resolution 16 times the flow resolution (32×32). The image resolution is 512×512 and the LIC half-kernel length is 160, as the observation of Jänicke et al. is that the lowest error is achieved using large kernels. Our experiments show that the average angular error is within range of the previously reported error 10%-30%. For randomly generated flows due to their higher turbulence, the observed error is larger (below 20%) than for the flows with simple topology (around 10%).</p><p>For each flow we compute four visualizations: LIC, OLIC, OGR LIC with single frequency (period 8 pixels), and OGR LIC with two frequencies combined (periods 4 and 6). Next we estimate the quality score as suggested by Jänicke, computing the average angular error between the flow and each of the three visualizations. We conduct a paired differences z-test for the the AAE estimates within the following scenarios: LIC vs. single-frequency OGR LIC images, OLIC vs. single-frequency OGR LIC images, and single-frequency vs. multi-frequency visualization assuming as a null hypothesis that the estimated means are equal in each pair. That is, for each test the statistic of interest D is the pair-wise difference in AAE for different visualizations, the estimate of the expected value of D is the empirical mean of the observed differences. Given (by construction) independence of the random samples and a sufficient number of samples (n=100), the central limit theorem suggests approximately a normal distribution of the test statistics D (around zero if the null hypothesis is true), thus meeting the z-test conditions. The actual histograms for the paired data (can be found in the supplementary material) do indeed have a shape of normal distribution, but centered around values different from zero. The results of the test with high statistical significance suggest that for each test the null hypotheses should be rejected in favor of the conclusions that OGR LIC visualization produces lower AAE than LIC, OGR LIC visualization produces lower AAE than OLIC, and OGR LIC multifrequency produces lower AAE than single-frequency filtering with p-values practically indistinguishable from zero (z-scores 9.92 38.9, and 18.10).</p><p>Finally, we estimate the mean AAE within 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on the 100 samples for each of the four visualizations. The results can be found in the supplementary material and are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>  evidence supporting our initial assumption that frequency-centric images preserve at least the same amount of the directional information of the original flow with respect to the chosen metric as traditional LIC methods. Importantly, this outcome refers to the verification of correctness of the developed technique rather than implying the usefulness of the resulting visualization for a any particular problem. The latter has to be addressed with a specific user study. We interpret the achieved results as follows: low spatial-frequency (global) features in LIC images account mostly for noise, while the directional information is captured by high-frequency (localized) components of the visualization. One interesting observation is the observed lower error score of the multi-frequency OGR LICcompared to onefrequency OGR LICvisualization. Clearly, broader spectrum does not automatically yield lower error, since a sum of several frequencyoriented images converges towards plain LIC. Our explanation for this effect is that refined (single-frequency) visualization can not fully represent the flow detail, while a combination of several (high) frequencies allows for increase in accuracy. Subsequent widening of the spectrum towards the lower end, introduces less useful signal and higher amounts of noise, degrading the overall visualization quality. An optimal range in the spectrum is likely to appear in the high frequency band (naturally bounded by the Nyquist limit). A particular optimal choice of frequencies depending on the flow field could be further investigated in the future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We believe this work has the potential for a number of future improvement directions. The proposed method features high applicability as a drop-in replacement for classic LIC with the possibility of additional adaptive local frequency control. The particular limitations for several specific applications of the suggested ideas are discussed in the corresponding sections. Closely related to LIC, our technique inherits some of its difficulties as well. In particular we currently have not yet come up with a practical solution for rendering the OGR LIC results of volumetric flows. That is, the technique is currently designed to work in the screen-space. Extending it to 3D object space, though possible by itself, requires, to be useful in practice, to additionally solve the problem of efficient rendering of the resulting dense visualization. Another feature in common with the traditional LIC is that our method is agnostic to the flow magnitude and orientation of the flow. These basic properties can be easily visualized with additional means (e.g., color, glyphs). Our preliminary results indicate that the suggested method is suitable for generation of continuous visualizations for time dependent data (see the supplementary material) as well, but more research is necessary to validate this property. As mentioned in Section 4.3, maintaining the time-coherence between frames requires careful selection of the kernel length in time direction. Finally, the theoretical analysis of the proposed framework looks promising for the development of new visualization and flow analysis methods. In particular, the discretization of the generic LIC operator in Equation 1 allows to explain and control its effect in terms of matrix and spectral graph theory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper we presented OGR LIC-a novel technique to produce frequency-oriented LIC images. We have demonstrated that by using this technique it is possible to achieve adaptive local spatial frequency control in flow visualization images not relying on noise injection. As the technical grounds of our method, we have formulated a generalized operator framework that unifies LIC and OGR LIC and allows us to analyze the effect of these methods in the frequency domain. Apart from our novel frequency-oriented filtering concept, the presented visualization approach embraces many of the known technical achievements in the DFV: iterated (n-fold) LIC, contrast normalization, and texture stitching (post-LIC multi-frequency texture blending). The proposed method features the run-time efficiency of LIC, rests on the solid grounds of perceptional studies and the basics of spectral theory, and provides a level of spatial frequency control, to the best of our knowledge, unprecedented in dense flow visualization.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>A sketch of the Fourier spectrum of the LIC kernel (a), Gabor kernel (b), and the convolution in the spatial domain of LIC and Gabor filters (c).</figDesc></figure>
