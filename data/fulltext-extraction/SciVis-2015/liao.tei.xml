			<abstract>
				<p>Numerical weather predictions have been widely used for weather forecasting. Many large meteorological centers are producing highly accurate ensemble forecasts routinely to provide effective weather forecast services. However, biases frequently exist in forecast products because of various reasons, such as the imperfection of the weather forecast models. Failure to identify and neutralize the biases would result in unreliable forecast products that might mislead analysts; consequently, unreliable weather predictions are produced. The analog method has been commonly used to overcome the biases. Nevertheless, this method has some serious limitations including the difficulties in finding effective similar past forecasts, the large search space for proper parameters and the lack of support for interactive, real-time analysis. In this study, we develop a visual analytics system based on a novel voting framework to circumvent the problems. The framework adopts the idea of majority voting to combine judiciously the different variants of analog methods towards effective retrieval of the proper analogs for calibration. The system seamlessly integrates the analog methods into an interactive visualization pipeline with a set of coordinated views that characterizes the different methods. Instant visual hints are provided in the views to guide users in finding and refining analogs. We have worked closely with the domain experts in the meteorological research to develop the system. The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated using two case studies. An informal evaluation with the experts proves the usability and usefulness of the system.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Numerical weather prediction (NWP) has been practiced operationally at many forecast centers since the middle of the 20th century <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Multiple simulations of the future weather are created from slightly perturbed initial states to simulate the uncertainty contributed by imperfections in the forecast model itself. Given the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, even small initial differences increase rapidly with time; thus, probabilistic forecasts of future states are more theoretically tenable than deterministic forecasts for domain experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Despite the rapid progress in the development of NWP, problems still exist. The forecasts may be systematically too warm or too cold, too wet or too dry. Meanwhile, it is a common occurrence to have ensembles of forecasts that have too little spread, and the true state lies outside the ensemble range. Calibration is then the process to address the deficiencies to improve the forecasts.</p><p>Many meteorological groups are exploring the "post-processing" methods for ensemble forecast. Of particular interest are the analog methods, which have shown promising results <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The idea of the method is to find past forecasts (i.e., analogs) in a geographically limited region that resemble the current forecast. A probabilistic estimate of the weather is then formed from the observed data at the time of the past forecasts. However, different similarity measures can be used to find the similar past forecasts and none is regarded perfect <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Meanwhile, no effective solution has been proposed to deal with the threshold problem in the analog methods.</p><p>Inspired by the majority voting method commonly used in machine learning, we propose a novel user-steered voting framework to refine the analogs obtained using three widely used analog methods. The framework consists of three interactive, coordinated views; each corresponds to one analog method. Through interactions on the coordinated views, users cast their votes for analogs. A two-step solution is proposed to address the threshold problem of the analog methods as well as ensure the reliability of the final forecasts. Based on the framework, we work closely with the domain experts to develop a visual analytics system that empowers the experts to calibrate the forecasts effectively. Two case studies and user evaluations demonstrate the usability of the system.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are as follows:</p><p>• A characterization of the calibration problem in the operational weather forecasting. • A novel voting framework that effectively combines different analog-based methods using three coordinated visualizations. • A visual analytics system based on the voting framework that assists forecasters in the calibration using analog methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Meteorological Data Visualization Meteorological data visualization has become an important topic since tens of years ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. Many practical visualization tools have been developed to support domain research, such as Vis5D <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Ferret <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and GRADS <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, a gap still exists between the advanced visualizations and domain work in climate research <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>Several visual analytics systems have been developed through close collaborations with meteorologists. Kehrer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> have proposed a novel visualization pipeline to support hypothesis generation from large scale climate data. To visualize climate variability changes, Janicke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> have used the wavelet analysis to perform the multi-scale visualization. Lundblad et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> have developed an application to identify significant trends and patterns within IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference 2015 October 25-30, Chicago, Il, USA 978-1-4673-9785-8/15/$31.00 ©2015 IEEE weather data using interactive information visualization techniques. Doraiswamy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> have presented a framework for the identification and tracking of cloud systems. These works assist the domain experts in understanding the atmospheric state and contribute to many practical applications. However, there is little visualization work which supports the weather forecast calibration.</p><p>Uncertainty Visualization for Meteorological Ensemble Data Many researchers have contributed to the issue of uncertainty visualization for meteorological data. MacEachren et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> have provided a detailed introduction to the visualization of geo-spatial information uncertainty. Pang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> have done a lot of research on geo-spatial data visualization. To reveal the probabilistic nature of the data, Potter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> have described a framework that visualizes the numerical weather ensemble data with linked views. Sanyal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> have designed an informative ribbon and glyphs to visualize the uncertainty in multiple numerical weather model. Pöthkow et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> measure the positional uncertainty of isocontours with the isocontour density and the level crossing probability field. Pfaffelmoser et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> have provided a color mapping and glyph based visualization solution for visualizing the variability of gradients in 2D scalar fields. Using the Lagrangian-based distance metric, Guo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> have evaluated and visualized the variation that exists in ensemble runs. Poco et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> have proposed an iterative visual reconciliation solution for similarity spaces in climate model research. Whitaker et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> have introduced the contour boxplots to visualize and explore the contours in ensemble fields.</p><p>However, most of the visualization work have not discussed about the consistency between the forecast data and the observed data, which is one of the domain experts' main concerns in the weather forecasting. Moreover, the previous methods cannot be directly applied to visualize the large scale historical data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calibration in Meteorological Research</head><p>The goal of the calibration is to detect and correct the potential errors in the weather forecasts before publications. Glahn et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> have used the linear regression, which is also known as "Model Output Statistics", to calibrate the forecast. Raftery et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> have used Bayesian model averaging to calibrate forecast ensembles. Gneiting et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> have detailedly discussed the probabilistic forecast and the calibration. Although these methods have demonstrated usefulness, they all lack interactive tools which can effectively integrate domain knowledge into the statistical processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DOMAIN TASKS AND DATASET DESCRIPTION</head><p>This section briefly discusses the domain tasks and describes the data used in our system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Domain Tasks</head><p>Three main tasks in forecast calibration have been identified through close collaboration with forecasters, observations on their routine work, and detailed discussions about their working flow.</p><p>T1 Generating Initial Forecast An initial forecast is produced using a post-processing method, such as the analog method. T2 Detecting Regions of Interest (ROI) The initial forecast derived after the post-processing step could have potential biases. Thus, forecasters need to detect ROIs where biases exist. T3 Applying Detailed Calibrations Calibrations are applied to the detected ROIs statistically or manually according to the professional knowledge of the experts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Dataset Description</head><p>The reforecast data and the observed data are used in this study. Reforecast Data The reforecasts are from the US NCEP Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS). The GEFS reforecasts are grid data with a resolution of ∼ 0.5 • . They comprise an 11-member ensemble of forecasts which run every day. The reforecasts span from 1985 to present. A variety of forecast variables are produced. Detailed descriptions of the reforecasts can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Observed Data The observed data are the NCEP Climatology-Calibrated Precipitation Analysis (CCPA) data. The CCPA data are grid data with a resolution of 0.125 • . The data spans from 2002 to present and covers the continental US. The analysis data are saved every 6 hours. In practical usages, the analysis data are regarded as the ground truth description of the real weather state. Detailed descriptions of the CCPA data can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">VISUAL VOTING FRAMEWORK</head><p>In this section, we introduce a set of analog methods, and present the visual voting framework used to combine the methods and support the weather forecast calibration, which is the task of T3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Analog Methods</head><p>The analog method has two successive main steps: the step of analog retrieval and the step of probabilistic forecast generation. The analog retrieval step is designed to find the past forecasts with similar data in the ROI. The difference between the current forecast and the past one is defined as the root mean square (RMS) difference of a variable or the weighted sum of the RMS differences (aggregated RMS differences) of several variables. Meanwhile, the mean of the ensemble forecasts is used for the calculation of variable RMS differences. Thereafter, N analogs with the smallest differences or the analogs that satisfy a specified threshold constraint are selected. The probability distribution of the observed data from the corresponding dates of the analogs is used to provide an estimate of the event probability. For example, the probability of the precipitation exceeding 5 mm is 50% if the observed data of 10 out of 20 selected dates exceed 5 mm. More details can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>The analog method has many variants with different ROI sizes and difference norms (a blend match of several forecast variables or an independent variable). This is a detailed measure. A particular variable could be much more significant in some scenarios for the calibration. The variants retrieve analogs from different meaningful perspectives, but these may lead to rather diverse probabilistic forecasts when employing different thresholds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Visual Voting</head><p>Majority voting is one of the most fundamental and popular ensemble methods for classification. Inspired by this method, we regard each variant of the analog methods as a classifier for the past dates. A past date can be classified as selected or unselected.</p><p>Although majority voting is a well-understood method, it is tedious and error prone to manually set thresholds for each of the variants independently. Therefore, we need to provide suggestions to guide the user in making decision for the thresholds. Wherein, we design a two-step solution: iterative threshold searching for C1 and C2, followed by threshold suggestion and adjustment for C3, as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. Among the three variants of the analog methods, C1 and C2 provide global and local aggregated descriptions for the similarity, respectively, and C3 is a detailed measure. The goal of this design is to ensure that the selected dates are similar to the current one both globally and locally. Then adjustments can be made Step One</p><p>Step Two</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C2 C3</head><p>Voting Result</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Suggestions</head><p>Intial Input <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Visual Voting Framework. The framework comprises two main steps. The first step is the iterative threshold searching for C1 and C2. The second step is the threshold suggestion and adjustment for C3. After thresholds are set for all the three classifiers, majority voting is applied in order to achieve more reliable forecasts. Visual feedback of the result is presented to assist threshold setting through the whole framework.</p><p>according to the detailed measure of C3. Meanwhile, suggestions are provided for each of the measures. In the framework, the user is expected to compare the suggestions with their expectations and then determine the acceptable thresholds according to his expertise. Among the three classifiers, the threshold for C1 is the most intuitive for the domain experts to set manually. Therefore, our solution begins with the initial input for C1, as indicated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Iterative Threshold Searching for C1 and C2</head><p>This step aims to determine the proper thresholds for C1 and C2. After the initial input is set, a classification result can be obtained using C1. According to the suggestion from the domain experts, the selected forecasts should be similar to the current one both globally and locally. Therefore, the dates that selected using C2 should cover a specific portion (namely, covering rate) of those selected using C1. The covering rate for small region r i is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">CR r i = 1 T ∑ t∈Q σ (r i ,t, β i )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where Q is the set of selected dates using C1, T is the number of dates in Q, β i is the threshold for the small region, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">σ (r i ,t, β i ) = 1 if date t is selected using C2 for r i , otherwise σ (r i ,t, β i ) = 0.</formula><p>Given a covering rate (namely, CR r i , from the user), the RMS differences of the small region are sorted first. The threshold β i is then the smallest threshold by which the selected dates of C2 cover the specified rate of the ones from C1. In our system, we experimentally use a covering rate range of 0.6 to 0.8 to maintain the similar dates selected using C1 and leverage the variance between the dates selected using C1 and C2. Moreover, a lower bound of 20 and a upper bound, which is the higher value between the suggested threshold and the one used for the large region, are used to ensure the effectiveness of the result from C2, as indicated by S1 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. The user can then estimate the possible proper thresholds for C2 based on their expertise and the suggestion range. Subsequently, the similarity S R,t of a date t for a large region R can be computed using small regions, which choose t as one of the most similar dates.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S R,t = ∑ r i ∈R σ (r i ,t, β i ) n i (2)</formula><p>where r i indicates a small region within R, β i is the selected threshold for the small region, n i is the selected analog number for r i under the threshold of β i , and σ (r i ,t, β i ) = 1 if date t is selected using C2 for r i , otherwise σ (r i ,t, β i ) = 0. Thereafter, the similarity is normalized and used as another meaningful cue for the date selection in the large region. The suggested selected dates for the large region are then those which satisfy the similarity with smallest RMS differences among all the past dates, as indicated by S2 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. In our system, we experimentally use the similarity of 0.6 to ensure the similarity of the selected dates for the large region. New thresholds can be set iteratively until good similarities from C1, and satisfactory covering rates from C2 are obtained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Suggestion and Adjustment for C3</head><p>The next step is to adjust the threshold for C3. In our implementation, we use the ratio of the variable RMS difference and the current forecast variable value as the threshold. The ratio is a better measure compared with the absolute RMS difference. For example, the RMS difference of 5 mm has different impacts under the precipitation of 3 mm and 30 mm, but the ratio can handle it well.</p><p>The suggested threshold θ of the ratio values for C3 is then estimated by minimizing the bias between the selected dates by C3 and those by C1 and C2, as indicated by S3 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">min ∑ t ∑ r i ∈R abs(C 3 r i (t, θ ) −C 1 R (t)) + abs(C 3 r i (t, θ ) −C 2 r i (t)) (3)</formula><p>where C 3 r i (t, θ ) is the class label of C3 for the small region r i on date t, C 1 R (t) is the class label of C1, and C 2 r i (t) is the class label of C2. The labels of the selected and unselected dates are set to 1 and 0, respectively. We sample the ratio value with a small step size to achieve a set of bias values, and the ratio value with the minimum bias (Formula 3) is used as the suggestion. Then the domain user can leverage the suggested threshold and adjust the threshold for C3 to filter past dates whose ratio values are out of scope. When multiple variables are employed, the threshold suggestion and adjustment are conducted independently for each variable. As a result, the selected dates for C3 are the dates selected by all the variables.</p><p>Through this voting framework, relatively proper thresholds for each of the analog methods can be achieved through the user's supervisions and interactions. Combined with the majority voting, the framework can produce more reliable results for domain usages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">SYSTEM AND VISUALIZATION DESIGN</head><p>In this section, we provide an overview of the system design and then introduce the detailed visualization design in the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">System Design</head><p>Our system is designed to assist the domain experts' routine work. Thus, a companion system workflow is designed according to their calibration workflow, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>. According to the utilities of different views and the goal of each task introduced in Section 3.1, we divide our system workflow into five stages:</p><p>1.Data Overview: This stage helps domain experts obtain an overview of the ensemble data.</p><p>2.Post-processing: This stage generates initial probabilistic forecasts using predefined parameters and completes the task of T1.</p><p>3.ROI Detection: An RMS difference glyph is designed to assist in detecting ROIs, where the initial probabilistic forecasts might need refinements. Through this process, the task of T2 is supported.</p><p>4.Visual Calibration: Coordinated views are designed to support the visual voting framework. This stage provides support for the task of T3, which is our main focus in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.Comparison and Event Analysis:</head><p>The adapted forecasts generated after the visual calibration are compared with the initial ones to show how the visual calibration works. Meanwhile, the most similar historical events are presented to verify the forecast. A calibration task can be completed through all the five stages directed by a user guideline ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4(e)</ref>). We focus on the ROI Detection stage and the Visual Calibration stage in the following. The usage of other stages are demonstrated in the case studies. This RMS difference glyph view serves the stage of ROI detection ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3(a)</ref>). The aggregated RMS differences of the selected analogs for a small region are conveyed through a circular glyph as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3(c)</ref>. The angle is cut into N parts to visualize the sorted RMS differences of the N selected analogs. Color is used to encode the RMS difference. We choose the color sequence from colorbrewer2.org <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> to ensure the linear expression of RMS difference values. The glyph is placed according to the position of the small region on the map. A user can zoom in to obtain a detailed view of the RMS differences or zoom out to achieve an overview of the whole map ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3(b)</ref>). Furthermore, the user can brush a region for the subsequent analysis stages. With this view, a user can efficiently locate ROIs where analogs with larger RMS differences are selected, and further calibrations might be needed. In this design, the glyph is used for its rich applications in domain research. Meanwhile, the view conforms to the information seeking mantra of "Overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand" <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">ROI Detection</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Visual Calibration</head><p>Coordinated views and interactions are designed to implement the visual voting framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">View Design</head><p>The calibration view comprises one geographical view <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4(a)</ref>) and three views that correspond to the three selected analog methods ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4(b)</ref> for (C1), <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4</ref>(c) for C2 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4(d)</ref> for C3).</p><p>Geographical View: The geographical view is the RMS difference glyph view laid on a geographical map <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4(a)</ref>). This view presents the glyphs for the selected ROI from the previous stage.</p><p>Region RMS Difference View: The region RMS difference view is used to visualize the large region RMS differences and similarities of past dates <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4(b)</ref>) for C1. This view comprises a line chart <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4(b1)</ref>) and a color bar <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 4(b2)</ref>).</p><p>The line chart visualizes the sorted RMS differences of the large region. The x axis of the chart conveys the sorted dates based on the RMS differences, and the y axis presents the difference values. The RMS differences provide visual cues for the threshold setting, and the orange line shows the current selected RMS difference threshold (selected analog number). The color bar is used to visualize the similarity encoded using the selected dates from C2. The sorted dates are separated into a series of bins. Each bin is encoded with gray color to represent the average similarity value of the corresponding dates. The suggested threshold is then indicated by a purple line as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4(b1)</ref>. In this view, the user is expected to select a threshold smaller than the suggested value according to the increasing trend of the line chart and colors from the color bar.</p><p>Small Region RMS Difference View: This view is a pixel bar chart used to convey the aggregated RMS differences for the small regions within the ROI <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4(c)</ref>). Each bar represents a small region and the RMS differences of all the past dates are encoded into the pixel color in the y axis direction (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref>(a)). The view is designed to support the threshold setting for C2 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6(a)</ref>) and visualize the final voting results <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 6(b)</ref> and 6(c)).  To support intuitive and efficient threshold setting for each small region, sorting is adopted. First, we sort the aggregated RMS differences for each small region (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5(a)</ref>). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5(b)</ref>, the date with the smallest RMS difference is placed at the bottom of each bar, and the largest at the top. Then inspired by the common experience that the more unusual the prediction forecast is, the smaller N value should be employed, we sort the bars horizontally according to the average aggregated RMS differences of the small regions. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5(c)</ref>, the average RMS differences of the bars increase from the left to the right. A typical threshold selection for the small regions can then be set, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5(d)</ref>. Meanwhile, the suggestions from the classification result of C1 should be presented to the user, which are highlighted by two purple lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4(c)</ref>.</p><p>To visualize the final voting results, the pixels that represent unselected dates are hidden <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 6(b)</ref>), and the remaining pixels can be accumulated to provide a more intuitive impression of the number of selected dates for the small regions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6(c)</ref>). The suggested lower bound for the threshold is also indicated by a purple line in the view, which is a visual suggestion for the whole framework.</p><p>In this view, the pixel bar chart is selected because the chart is intuitive and simple, and can visualize a large amount of data.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Small Region Variable RMS Difference View:</head><p>This view is designed to support the classification using C3 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4(d)</ref>). It comprises a bar chart <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4(d1)</ref>) for visualizing the ratio values and a line chart <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 4(d2)</ref>) for the bias defined by Formula 3. The bar chart shares the same axis with the pixel bar chart in the Small Region RMS Difference View. For each small region, bars that encode ratio values of past dates are horizontally placed in the x axis with the same order utilized by the y axis of the pixel bar chart, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7(b)</ref>. In case of a majority voting of three variants, only those dates that have been selected using C1 or C2 are presented. Through the bar chart visualization, outliers can be detected and filtered by adjusting the threshold for the ratio value more easily, compared to the pixel bar chart. The line chart <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 4(d2)</ref>) visualizes the biases between the dates selected using C3 and those selected using C1 and C2 under different thresholds for C3. The user can achieve a clear view of the bias distribution and estimate the proper threshold while avoiding a huge bias. The suggestion is indicated by a purple line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4(d)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">Interactions and View Coordination</head><p>The four small views are all linked. Double clicking and brushing are supported to enable the setting of the thresholds for C1 and C2, respectively. Suggestions are updated immediately after the user input is completed. The iterative threshold searching for C1 and C2 can be efficiently conducted through these interactions. When adjusting the threshold for C3, the final results are also updated in real time, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6(c)</ref>. Therefore, the domain user can achieve a clear view of the final voting results and leverage the proper threshold. Highlights are also designed to enhance the linking among views as indicated by the red arrows in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4</ref>, which can effectively enhance the view coordination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION</head><p>Two case studies are presented in this section to exhibit the usability of our system. The first one demonstrates the common workflow of our system to help calibrate a forecast. The second one demonstrates the use of our system in detecting an unusual forecast and providing supports for the verification based on historical data.</p><p>Experiments have been performed with domain experts to calibrate the probabilistic forecasts of the total accumulated precipitation for 24 hours. Three forecast variables are adopted, namely, total accumulated precipitation (APCP), precipitable water (PREW), and temperature at 2 m (T2M), which are provided by our domain collaborators. Our system uses the data from 2002 to 2013, and only those dates within a window size of 70 that center on the analyzed day are adopted for each year. In addition, the weighted summary of APCP and PREW is used as the aggregated variable with the weights of 0.7 and 0.3, respectively, which is also used by one of our collaborators in his domain research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Case One</head><p>The data used are from April 27, 2013. After loading the data, our system provides an overview of the data, as is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8(a)</ref>. A heavy precipitation is recorded in the United States. Post-processing is then performed with the aggregated variables, and initial probabilistic forecasts are generated using the analog method of C2. In the experiment, two results with different analog numbers, namely, 50 and 70, are generated, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8(d1)</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 8(d2)</ref>, respectively. The analog number 50 is suggested by one of our domain collaborators based on his previous research. Thereafter, an ROI with high RMS differences is brushed for the further calibration, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8(b)</ref>. In case of high RM-S differences, biases may occur in the probabilistic forecast of the region. The visual calibration stage begins with an estimation for the threshold of C1. Given that the threshold does not necessarily have to be accurate, and that it can be refined through successive iterations, an analog number of 50 is also set as the initial input. Threshold searching iterations are then performed, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8(c1)</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 8(c2)</ref>. For small regions with low RMS differences, high analog numbers are applied, as indicated by the brown arrow in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 8(c2)</ref>. For the small regions indicated by the red arrow in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 8(c2)</ref>, RMS differences are mostly over 10 mm, which are high for the current weather. Therefore, the thresholds for these small regions are nearly at the suggested lower bound. In the color bar which encodes the similarity of past dates in the large region, a clear distribution of the similarity is presented, as shown in the red borders in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8(c1)</ref>. The threshold for C1 can then be set to ensure that the selected dates all possess high similarity values. After the refinement iterations, the thresholds are adjusted for the variables. The bias distribution and the suggested threshold for APCP are evident, as indicated by the brown arrow in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 8(c3)</ref>. However, the minimum bias for T2M is reached with a ratio of nearly 0, as indicated by the red arrow in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 8(c3)</ref>. This finding indicates that the most similar dates based on APCP and PREW differ significantly from those based on T2M, which confirms the previous research conclusion that precipitation forecast accuracy decreases by including T2M when finding analog dates for the precipitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The thresholds are then adjusted to filter dates that are clear outliers and decrease the distance between the current threshold for APCP and the suggested threshold, while ensuring that the remaining numbers of selected dates for the small regions are mostly above the lower bound, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 8(c4)</ref>. Thereafter, the calibrated probabilistic forecast is generated, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 8(d3)</ref>. Meanwhile, the observed map for the same day is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 8(d4)</ref>. Through these steps, the calibration for this region is completed by the probabilistic forecast generation, and other kinds of forecasts can also be achieved through the calibrated forecasts.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(APCP) (a) Data Overview (b) ROI Detection (c) Visual Calibration (d) Forecast Comparison (c1) (c2) (c4) (c3) (d1) (d2) (d3) (d4) (APCP) (T2M)</formula><p>As indicated in the observed map, the precipitation in the region indicated by the red arrow is evidently heavier than that in the region indicated by the brown arrow. Hence, the calibrated probabilistic forecast generated using the visual voting framework can reflect the precipitation distribution better than the initial forecast when the probability is higher in the region indicated by the red arrow than in the region indicated by the brown arrow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Case Two</head><p>The data used are from August 25, 2013. A heavy precipitation is recorded in Arizona, US (highlighted in the red rectangle in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 9(a)</ref>). However, the RMS differences in this region are high. The ROI is then selected from the RMS difference glyph view as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 9(b)</ref>. During the visual calibration stage, the suggested analog number for the large region continues to decrease when we perform threshold searching iterations, as shown by the red arrows in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 9</ref>(c1) to 9(c3). The suggested analog number only stops decreasing when the suggested range for the small regions reaches the lower bound set in our system, as indicated by the red arrow in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 9(c4)</ref>. By this time, the suggested analog number for the large region is nearly below 10. Thus, the current forecast can be regarded as a probable unusual forecast even in the long history. Thereafter, the most similar analogs can be viewed, and two of these analogs are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 9(d1)</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 9(d2)</ref>. For each analog, the left part of the figure is the forecast of the analog, whereas the right part is the corresponding observed data. Based on the analogs, we can conclude that the forecast is mostly expected to be higher than the observed weather in the region. This conclusion can also be achieved through the probabilistic forecast and confirmed by the observed data for the same day, as shown in the red borders in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 9</ref>(d3) to 9(d4). The probability of the precipitation is low in that region, but the forecast precipitation in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 9(a)</ref> is high. Moreover, the observed data shows a lower precipitation than the forecast. Through these steps, the calibrated probabilistic forecast can be published for public usages, and the forecasters can make other customized forecasts accordingly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Domain Expert Feedback</head><p>The proposed system is developed in close collaborations with the meteorologists. A senior forecaster and an experienced meteorol- ogist who has conducted extensive research on the analog method are involved in the development process. Two meteorologists who specialize in forecast verification then help evaluate our system. We have collected their feedback about the system as well as other important topics, such as the accuracy and speed improvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>System Evaluation</head><p>The weather forecaster helps ensure that the system workflow fits the domain experts' routine workflow smoothly through the development. He appreciates the analog methods integrated into the interactive system the most. In terms of visualization, the weather forecaster appreciates the pixel bar chart and the brushing interaction the most. He believes that the view is intuitive and expressive in conveying the RMS differences.</p><p>The meteorologist with extensive experiences in analog method research appreciates the interactivity of the tool in supporting the method the most. He said:" The tool mimics the way a weather forecaster thinks about the weather prediction process. They typically compare today's weather forecasts to past forecasts, think about what actually happened, and construct a mental model for today's forecast. The analog procedure you demonstrate is sort of like an objective way for a forecaster to visualize what's in his brain."</p><p>The two meteorologists who specialize in verification are extremely interested in our system. Both meteorologists indicate that the tool is highly useful for long-time forecast verification, which covers years of data. The meteorologists appreciate the usability of the method in verifying precipitation level. Meanwhile, they comment that the analog method is ineffective in detecting the shape and position biases of precipitation regions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accuracy Improvement</head><p>The four domain experts all confirm that our system is the first interactive tool they have ever known and used to assist the calibration using the analog method from a long historical perspective. The system enables them to explore the historical data and understand the forecast better, which is difficult to achieve without our system. This can enhance their justifications for the calibration.</p><p>During the discussions with the domain experts, they point out three typical scenarios under which our system might work well. First, when the numerical prediction model is updated, the potential bias patterns in the forecast might change. Second, novice forecasters usually know little about the potential bias patterns existing in the ensemble forecast. Through our system, they can quickly understand the data and conduct better forecast calibrations. Third, when unusual events occur, forecasters can locate historical similar events quickly with our system and conduct the further analysis. In all these scenarios, forecasters might doubt about how to calibrate the forecast, and our system can provide informative assistances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Speed Improvement</head><p>The senior forecaster points out that what our system introduces is a new calibration process for him. Whether our system will help speed up the entire calibration depends on the complexity of the forecast and the forecasters' experiences. For example, an experienced forecaster can complete a forecast calibration very efficiently. Our system might not help speed up, but increase his confidence in the calibration. However, if the bias patterns in the forecast are hard to justify through domain experts' experiences, our system will help speed up the calibration. He also mentions that, there is no way for him to calibrate the forecast from a long historical perspective without our system. Although the analog methods have been proved to be useful, it has still not been widely used in the forecasters' routine work. Among the four domain experts, only one of them is using the method through a console window, which is a text user interface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Discussion</head><p>Although our system can effectively support the domain experts' routine work, based on the case studies and domain expert feedback, several issues still require further discussions.</p><p>First, our framework extends the analog method through the majority voting. Since the analog methods have many variants, the voting is a good choice to deal with the analog selection problem when we use several variants simultaneously. Meanwhile, we have designed a thorough process to assist domain experts in setting thresholds for the three selected variants. This can enhance the step of the analog selection and the generation of the probabilistic forecast. Therefore, the quality of the calibration can be improved.</p><p>Second, we have conducted an evaluation of the time that our system might cost through experiments. Currently a typical analysis process for an ROI might cost about 5-8 minutes. The time can be further reduced when the experts become familiar with the system. We can further reduce the time by, for example, enhancing the brushing interaction by selecting patches on a segmented map.</p><p>Third, the ROI in our system is a special case and we define it as the region which selects analogs with high RMS differences for generating the probabilistic forecast. It is different from the ROI definitions in some previous research, such as regions with high data uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and those with predictive error <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. More specifically, our ROI definition is to detect the region where errors might exist in the generated initial probabilistic forecast.</p><p>Fourth, the final results might be different when the same forecast is analyzed by various users. However, the suggestions provided by our system can work as a constraint and guide user interactions to decrease the variances of the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this study, the calibration problem is characterized and the analog method is utilized to help solve it. A visual voting framework is proposed to address problems in the existing analog methods. Moreover, a visualization system based on the framework is provided to assist in calibrating weather forecasts. Coordinated views and intuitive interactions are provided to support the involvement of domain experts' professional knowledge in the statistical method. Therefore, the calibration can be better conducted. The system is developed through close collaborations with the domain experts. Case studies and feedback from the domain experts have exhibited the promising usability of our system in supporting the calibration.</p><p>In the future, we will integrate our system into the domain system that we are developing with the domain experts. We plan to include additional statistical methods in the system to solve problems that cannot be addressed well by analog methods, such as considerable position and shape biases of precipitation regions and the continuous calibration for meteorological events that last for days.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Overview of the system workflow.
