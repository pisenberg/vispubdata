<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Visualization of treelike objects is a common task for inspection of structures such as blood vessels and airways. However, observing these objects, whether from an internal or external viewpoint, can be challenging due to occlusions and thus the need to rotate the view. It has been shown that visualizing a 3D object in 2D reduces complexity and makes tasks more efficient and accurate, though it has also been indicated that maintaining the sense of structure for the object is important <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. This has motivated us to develop a method to create planar visualizations of such objects where there are no occlusions, but the overall geometric context of the object is preserved. This allows the user to succinctly investigate all parts of the object, while being able to easily identify the current region being investigated. The resulting objective of this work is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> using a bronchial tree. Treelike objects are common occurrences in medicine, and there is often great effort in extracting them due to their importance <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Some procedures look at the interior of such tubular structures (e.g., virtual bronchoscopy), while others will look at values mapped to the surface (e.g., simulations for vessel walls). For such applications, there are two use cases where planar visualizations would be advantageous. The first use case is as a guidance map, especially for virtual endoscopic procedures. By presenting the entire object to the user in a single view without occlusions, but which still has the global shape of the object, one's location within the structure can be easily identified without fear of it being occluded, which would necessitate a rotation of the 3D map. The second use case is to utilize such a map for direct inspection. Having a planar version of the object allows for the user to easily observe the entire surface without missing any regions while still being able to understand one's location. A depth-first search of such a flattened object would be an appropriate guidance for inspection, and various views, such as volume rendering the interior of the organ or viewing a color map on the surface, can be provided.</p><p>In this work, we present a method for creating planar maps of treelike objects without occlusions which maintain the general geometric context of the original structure. These maps are created by first finding a planar layout, without intersections, of the object skeleton (i.e., central axis), and then using this to guide the flattening of the object surface. In some sense, the problem of finding a 2D layout of a skeleton with no self-intersections can be considered as a planar graph embedding problem. Since this work is on treelike objects, and thus there are no cycles in the skeleton, it is guaranteed that a planar embedding exists. We introduce a modified radial embedding algorithm which takes into account the required order in which branches are to be embedded to allow for the final shape reconstruction to be achieved. Using this planar embedding, we have developed an optimization procedure that reconstructs the original shape as much as possible without creating any intersections.</p><p>Given a target embedded skeleton to use as the basis for flattening the object surface, we address the need for creating a boundary along the object by slicing the mesh open in a manner which is consistent with the order of the embedded branches. Given this surface, which is now topologically equivalent to a plane, we use harmonic mapping to flatten it to the plane. To account for regions where the surface is stretched across concavities near bifurcations, a boundary adjustment procedure is introduced to better fit the data. Using this flattened surface, various modes of visualization can be provided using it as a map for guidance or for direct inspection. We also present a grayscale border which provides depth cues to the user, allowing for one to identify which areas are closer to the user and further from the background.</p><p>We introduce the following new ideas in this paper:</p><p>• A method to flatten a treelike structure to the plane such that both the general shape of the structure and the relative lengths of the branches are preserved.</p><p>• An algorithm to create a planar embedding of tree graphs which creates an embedding with ordered importance for branches.</p><p>• A parameterization method with a movable boundary to map the object surface from 3D to 2D.</p><p>• Depth cue borders on the parameterization to aid in rapid recognition of object depth. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents related works on the extraction and use of curve skeletons, on planar graph embedding, on visualization of branching structures, and on techniques for mapping surfaces from 3D to 2D. In Section 3 we discuss our algorithm for creating the planar maps of the objects, including the planar embedding and shape optimization of the object skeleton and the surface mapping based on this skeleton. Section 4 explores the planar visualization uses and techniques for these created maps. We discuss our results in Section 5, present the evaluation in Section 6, and conclude the paper in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Due to the importance of skeleton curves in computer graphics and visualization, there has been much work dedicated to methods of extracting these curves from objects. For extracting skeletons from volumetric medical data, methods have been proposed which connect centerlines based on a medial voxel axis <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> or which use a distance from boundary field with penalty weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. For obtaining a skeleton directly from a mesh, methods have been presented based on surface contraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, through the use of advection to move mass from the object surface to its skeleton <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and through the use of least squares optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. For data from incomplete point clouds, curve skeletons can also be approximated based on a generalized rotational symmetry axis for a set of points <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>The skeleton curve of an object compactly and efficiently represents the general geometric shape of the structure, and such curves are employed in a wide variety of applications, including for navigation, animation, and analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Virtual endoscopy applications often use paths based on extracted skeletons to automatically guide the user through a navigation of the object <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. It is important that such paths are accurate and reliable to ensure that the entirety of the internal surface of the organ is presented to the user <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. These paths are especially useful in virtual bronchoscopy systems due to the large number of bifurcations through the airway tree, and extracting and utilizing these skeletons for path planning is an important task <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>For visualizing graph data, there has been much work on various ways of performing both planar embeddings and 3D visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and there is interest in methods to improve the layouts of planar graphs while maintaining planarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Specific to treelike structures, there has been interest in planar visualization of trees of hierarchical data <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and contour trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Radial embedding of graphs is one popular area of graph drawing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and we adapt a method of radial embedding for phylogenetic trees which takes into account fixed edge lengths <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Unlike other works which are content only to find a pleasing embedding, we seek an embedding which is not only planar and with fixed edge lengths, but which also depicts as accurately as possible the actual shape of the object.</p><p>Surface parameterization is a popular topic for research in computer graphics <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. Conformal geometry for mapping triangular meshes, where local angles are preserved, has been used in the creation of texture maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. Harmonic maps are one method to map between two topological disks, and such maps are conformal under certain circumstances <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Discrete Ricci flow is a recent method of computing conformal maps of structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and it has been used to obtain optimal surface parameterizations using inverse curvature maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. However, Ricci flow requires a target Gaussian curvature for each vertex and is thus difficult to control when utilizing a fixed boundary.</p><p>Applying mapping techniques for flattening objects to the plane is common in visualization applications, but somewhat limited in medical applications of hollow structures. Such unfolding tends to be limited to simple organs such as the colon <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> and bladder <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Similar techniques have been applied in a limited sense to flatten vessels in an angle preserving manner, though a straightening is performed, thus losing the geometric context <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. There has been work on 2D mappings to more easily observe the surface data <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, though this technique uses a multi-perpective view which distorts the view. In our work, we flatten complex objects to the plane such that the overall global shape of the object from a single viewpoint is preserved.</p><p>A technique commonly used to flatten vascular structures is curved planar reformation (CPR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Different CPR methods exist, but they trade off between overlapping branches which yield occlusions, distortion of skeleton length resulting in a loss of isometry, and loss of global shape preservation which reduces accurate spatial perception. In general, the CPR technique would be applied to individual branches, and the results would then be composited together. Later work to address multi-path reformation requires a relaxation of constraints on spatial relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. In all cases, CPR reformats how the original image data (e.g., CT) is presented to the user. In our work, we map an extracted discrete 3D surface (i.e., the triangular mesh) to the 2D plane, allowing for the entire surface to be viewed in a single image. The mapping we employ is quasi-conformal, so local shapes on the surface are generally preserved, in addition to the global shape of the structure.</p><p>Displaying treelike objects, especially vascular structures, for better comprehension has been an ongoing problem in the visualization field <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Most often 3D views are utiliized, such as to observe wall thickness <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Conveying a sense of depth, allowing the user to observe which vessels overlap others, is also important, and techniques have been developed for both illustrative <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and more realistic vol- ume rendering <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. However, these techniques focus on enhancing the depth perception in the 3D scene, while in our work, we seek to maintain a sense of depth for relationships between branches in the 2D parameterization.</p><p>In work on coronary artery visualization, users have indicated that accurate anatomical information is important <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. While that work created tree diagrams to portray this anatomical information, a single connected surface representing the true shape of the arteries was not provided. In other work which dealt with the idea of straightening objects for comparison, and thus losing the geometric context, it was noted that such views were foreign to physicians, who were accustomed to the original shapes of the objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Previous work specifically on context preserving flattening of discrete mesh representations of objects has been limited to simple tubular structures without branches <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The method used therein is not robust to multi-branched objects. Based on first embedding the skeleton and then removing intersections through a series of reflections which distort the shape, it could also lead to undesirable results. We present here a new method to create the skeleton layout in 2D that first finds a guaranteed planar embedding of the skeleton tree structure, and then adjusts this embedding to recover the original shape. With the shape recovery last, it cannot become distorted due to intersection removal. Rather than using a two-step flattening procedure with Ricci flow and harmonic mapping, we use a single harmonic mapping step which operates on the full high resolution mesh dataset and not on a reduced version. In our mapping, we also take into account where the mesh is being distorted too much by spreading outside the boundary and adjust the boundary to account for this. The parameterization is only a portion of the entire algorithm, and our work is focused on ensuring a precise shape of the embedding for the 2D mapping. Our work here also explores problems specific to more complicated multibranched structures, such as the order of placement for branches in the embedding and the proper slicing of the boundary for unfolding, and provides depth cues for the user to assist in understanding the complicated flattened structures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">ALGORITHM</head><p>The procedure for creating the planar map of a treelike object is based upon using the object skeleton to preserve the shape. Using a 2D version of this skeleton and the estimated radius along the skeleton, a radial planar embedding is produced which guarantees no intersections of the 2D skeleton. This embedded skeleton is then deformed so that the angular curvature resembles that of the original projected skeleton. Using this shape restored skeleton, the object surface is sliced open such that the boundaries are consistent for the planar mapping and the flattening is then performed using harmonic mapping.</p><p>The skeleton used for this is arranged in a tree form where each node has exactly one parent (except for the root) and any number of children. Since branches along the skeleton typicaly do not occur at exactly the same point, most nodes have no more than two children. A node at the end of a branch, with no children, is a leaf node. A node with more than one child, which therefore causes the split of one or more branches, is termed a branch node. All other nodes, with exactly one child, are inner nodes. The root node is a branch node which has no parent. Leaf and branch nodes can be collectively referred to as the group of significant nodes, and these nodes indicate the general structure of the skeleton. A region of inner nodes between two significant nodes is referred to as a segment of the skeleton.</p><p>The process of the algorithm is illustrated using the cranial blood vessels shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. Throughout the description, the following terms are used to describe the skeleton and its associated values. The skeleton S = (N, E) contains the set of n ∈ N nodes and e ∈ E edges connecting the nodes. Unlike conventional graph theory terminology, we term an edge e n as being the edge which goes from node n to its parent, parent(n). Therefore, the size of E is one less than the size of N since the root node root(S) has no parent and thus no edge. The estimated radius value of a node n is represented by ρ n .</p><p>The surface parameterization for the final result is calculated on a triangular mesh M = (V, E) that contains a set of v ∈ V vertices and e ∈ E edges, where e i j is an edge connecting vertices v i and v j . The original meshes are of closed surfaces and are topologically equivalent to a sphere (Euler characteristic χ = 2). In order to parameterize this closed surface to a plane, the creation of a mesh boundary ∂ M is detailed in Section 3.4 that makes the surface topologically equivalent to the plane (χ = 1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Orthographic Projection</head><p>The original 3D skeleton of the structure is first projected to a plane. To minimize distortion, this projection is accomplished using the standard orthographic projection matrix:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">  x ′ y ′ z ′   =   u x u y u z v x v y v z w x w y w z     x y z   ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where u, v, and w are the right, up, and normal vectors of the projection plane, respectively. For each projected point (x ′ , y ′ , z ′ ), (x ′ , y ′ ) are used to create the uv coordinates for the skeleton and z ′ is retained for use later in indicating the depth of the object along the view direction. The 2D projected skeleton is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>(a). Based on this 2D projection, an angle θ is calculated for each node and is used in reconstructing the shape. For a node n, θ n is computed as the angle between e n and e parent(n) . If the 2D edge length of e n is zero, then θ n = π (i.e., the segment will be straight out from the previous segment in the 2D domain). If the 2D edge length of e parent(n) is zero, then continue up the skeleton until a node p is reached such that the 2D edge length of e p is nonzero. If at any node parent(n) = root(S), then e parent(n) is given as the edge between root(S) and root(S) uv + (1, 0). The angles are stored as the counterclockwise rotation in the range of [0, 2π).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Radial Layout</head><p>Given the 2D projection of the skeleton, the next step is to perform a planar embedding of the skeleton such that there are no selfintersections, which would then become occlusions in the final surface mapping. To achieve this, a radial planar embedding is first found which guarantees that there are no intersections. This embedding discards the shape information, which will be reconstructed in the next step based on the angles previously calculated.</p><p>When performing the radial layout, it is important that branches are placed in the proper order for the final shape, since branches that are swapped cannot be swapped back in the shape optimization step that comes later. For this, we calculate a placement weight for the children of every node. This weight determines which child subtree should be placed first. Since the radial layout is performed in a counterclockwise direction, branches that should be placed left of their siblings must be embedded first and are given a lower weight value. This weight is calculated as the angle between the parent node edge and a line segment connected to the weighted center of the projected positions of nodes in the subtree. The weighted average is calculated along each subtree by weighting each subtree node's position by a factor of one minus the ratio of the current distance from the parent node over a maximum distance. This maximum distance is the length of the shortest subtree from the parent. The procedure for calculating these weights is given in Algorithm 1. The radial layout itself is based on previous work used in embedding phylogenetic trees, where specified edge lengths are known <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. This is similar to our situation, where the distance between two skeleton nodes must be preserved (in order to preserve the original 3D length of the skeleton), and thus fixed edge lengths are required. The method is modified to account for the order in which to place subtrees based on the desired location from the projected skeleton using the calculated placement weights, where a subtree with a lower placement weight is embedded before the other remaining unembedded subtrees. The modified procedure for the radial planar embedding using these weights is given in Algorithm 2. Note that the edge lengths ε used in </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">n ∈ N begin x root(S) ← (0, 0) ω root(S) ← 2π τ root(S) ← 0 EmbedNode(root(S)) end function EmbedNode(Node n) if n ̸ = root(S) then x n ← x parent(n) + ε n (cos(τ n + 0.5ω n ), sin(τ n + 0.5ω n )) η ← τ n forall the children(n) do c ← unembedded child with lowest α c ω c ← 2π(l c /l root(S) ) τ c ← η η ← η + ω c EmbedNode(c)</formula><p>this step are the original 3D edge lengths, allowing for the full length of the object to be portrayed. Otherwise, edges closely aligned with the view direction of the projection plane would be greatly reduced. The radially embedded skeleton is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>(b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Shape Recovery</head><p>Given the radial layout of the skeleton, we now have a 2D embedding which is guaranteed to have no intersections. However, the shape of the object has been lost since each branch has been straightened. To restore the shape, we bend each node around its parent, in a breadthfirst manner, using the original θ angles calculated based on the 2D projection, and the radius values are used to ensure that there is space for the parametrized surface. For this step, the radius values are increased slightly for use in the calculations so that there will be some empty space adjacent to where the parameterized surface will be (i.e., two branches in the parameterized surface will not touch).</p><p>As each node n is visited, the node is rotated based on its current angle and its target angle θ n . The amount of rotation attempted (γ) is the rotation necessary to achieve the target angle θ n scaled by a value κ. We have found a value of κ = 0.1 to work well, such that at each step the node is rotated by 10% of its required amount. When rotating a node, all of the nodes in its subtree are also rotated accordingly. Given this rotated subtree, it is checked to see if there are any intersec- tions of the skeleton or intersections of circles centered at each node with that node radius value. If any of these intersections are found, then the rotation is undone along the subtree, the target rotation for n is slightly reduced, and if it has a single child c, then θ c is modified by the small amount of the reduction. This process is continued until the maximum attempted rotation of a node in an iteration (γ max ) is below a specified threshold. We have found a threshold of γ max &lt; 0.01 to yield good results. When finding intersections of the radius circles, it is apparent that nearby nodes always have intersections. Due to this, for each node, we calculate the set of neighbor nodes. For a node n, another node m is a neighbor if the walking distance along the skeleton between them is less than or equal to π(ρ n + ρ m ), except in the case of leaf nodes. Using π as a scaling factor allows relatively nearby positions to become merged in the final flattening to better preserve the shape. For leaf nodes, the distance must be less than or equal to (ρ n + ρ m ), or else the tip of the skeleton may come too near to another section. If two nodes are considered to be neighbors, then any intersection of their radius circles is ignored. The procedure for this shape recovery step is given in Algorithm 3. The result of this process is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>(c) with circles illustrating the node radii.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Boundary Creation</head><p>In order to map the surface of the object to the plane, it is necessary to slice the mesh open to create a boundary, which makes the surface topologically equivalent to a plane. To accomplish this, for each significant node in the skeleton (leaf and branch nodes), a corresponding mesh vertex on the surface is found. For leaf nodes, this is simply the nearest vertex. For branch nodes, the cross product of the two vectors formed from the branch node to its child nodes is calculated as a direction vector, and the negation of it is taken if it is in the direction of the normal of the original projection plane. A ray from the branch node with this direction is then defined, and the nearest vertex in the nearest face which this ray intersects is taken as the corresponding vertex.</p><p>The surface must then be sliced open between these selected vertices, with a slice for every segment of the skeleton. In order to allow the surface to be unfolded properly without boundary intersections and ensuing self-intersections of the embedded surface (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4)</ref>, the slicing must be accomplished in a specific order. The slicing is performed top down, starting at the root. For the current significant node, paths are sliced between its corresponding mesh vertex and those of its children. To be in the correct order, the children are processed from right to left using the angles in the embedded skeleton (that is, processing from the child with the largest angle to that with the smallest). For the child being processed, the shortest path along the mesh surface from its vertex to the parent vertex is found. This path is then sliced along, such that a new vertex is created for each vertex along the path and triangles which contain one of the original vertices on the path will be associated with either the original or the newly created vertex, depending on which side the triangle is on. The vertices along the path form the boundary, and the vertices on the right side of the slice are the newly created ones, while the vertices on the left remain as the original ones. This is important so that when the shortest path is found for the next child (which is left of the current child) it is traced back to the original vertex point (which is on the left of the slice boundary).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Surface Mapping</head><p>In mapping the surface of the object to the plane, the planar positions of all boundary vertices in the mesh must be found. Every boundary vertex is first associated with the nearest skeleton node within that segment of the mesh. Since the boundaries were created in a consistent manner, boundary vertices from the original mesh can be placed at 90 • counterclockwise from the position of the embedded skeleton node, while the newly created vertices are placed at 90 • clockwise. A mean smoothing operation removes overlaps when multiple boundary vertices are associated with the same embedded skeleton node.</p><p>Given these initial planar boundary positions, there are often selfintersections of the boundary (loops) in narrow regions. To remove these loops, which also improves the area for which a large amount of the mesh must be mapped to, localized smoothing operations are performed within the loop and its nearby neighbors. Since the smoothing is restricted only to the looped section and its close neighbors, this does not affect the general global shape of the flattened object.</p><p>Harmonic mapping is used to map the interior vertices to the plane based on the fixed boundary. The edge weights that we use for this are the Mean Value Coordinates which are guaranteed to be positive <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. For a vertex v i , its edge weight k i j with respect to vertex v j is given as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">k i j = w i j ∑ v k ∈N(v i ) w ik , w i j = tan( α i ja 2 ) + tan( α i jb 2 ) ∥v i − v j ∥ (2)</formula><p>where N(v i ) is the set of all neighboring vertices to v i and α i ja and α i jb are the two angles at v i formed by e i j . Note that the edge weights are not symmetric, and thus k i j ̸ = k ji . Since the boundary is fixed during the parameterization, weights are calculated only for interior edges. The interior vertices are initially flattened to the plane by setting their positions equal to that of the boundary vertex to which they are nearest. Then the harmonic energy is optimized, where the total harmonic energy E(H) is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E(H) = ∑ [i, j]∈M k i j ∥h(v i ) − h(v j )∥ 2 (3)</formula><p>where h(v i ) is the value of v i in the harmonic function (for the Euclidean embedding, this is simply its 2D coordinate). The goal of the optimization is to reach the state such that the change in position</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∆h v = 0, where v / ∈ ∂ M.</formula><p>In the discrete implementation, the harmonic function is updated until the total distance moved by vertices between iterations is less than a specified threshold (we have found a threshold of 0.1 to yield good results).</p><p>Due to the unfolding, some regions of the mesh can become stretched over a concavity near a bifurcation (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>). This causes the triangles in the mesh to go outside of the desired boundary, and for some to become inverted such that the triangle's normal points in the opposite direction. To account for this, we adjust the affected boundary vertices as necessary where this inversion is occurring. This is accomplished by slightly translating the inverted vertex v orthogonal to the mesh boundary at that position. For this, we have found a value of one sixteenth the sum of the edge lengths of its two neighbor boundary edges to yield good results. A local smoothing operation is then applied to all translated boundary vertices. Periodically, the entire boundary is checked for loops in the boundary which may occur from this, and such loops are removed by further local smoothing. The final result of this flattening is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">VISUALIZATION</head><p>Given a planar representation of an object surface, there are several ways in which it can be visualized, depending on need. These include being used as a guidance map as well as for direct investigation using volume rendering of the interior of the object or showing color maps on the surface. An indication of the spatial relation in the z-direction of the view can also be provided by depth cues around the border of the object. For direct inspection of the object, a depth first traversal can be used to ensure complete coverage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Map Surface View</head><p>One use of the planar map is as an actual map to use for guidance during a virtual endoscopy. During a fly-through, physicians commonly need to note their current location within the structure, and a 3D map is often used for this task. However, since a 3D map may contain occlusions, the current position might be hidden, requiring the user to disengage from their current task to rotate the view and identify their location. Using a planar map eliminates this problem. For such a use, a view similar to an exterior view of the normal surface mesh would be appreciated. Since the mesh has been completely flattened to the plane, it would appear flat when rendered (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>). To give the mesh a more natural appearance, height can be assigned to the zcoordinates of the mesh. This is done by finding the shortest distance from each interior vertex to the boundary. This distance is then set to the z-coordinate of the vertex, raising it out of the plane. Now when rendered with lighting, a peaked appearance is given rather than a simple flat appearance (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7)</ref>. Although not smooth and rounded, this is actually advantageous, as the peak through the structure forms a central path through the object which can serve as a visual cue of an approximate skeleton.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Depth Cues</head><p>An indication of the z depth of the original 3D object can also be provided, and is a useful tool for more complicated branching structures. A border is first created around the boundary of the object. Based on the z-coordinates of the projected skeleton, the corresponding vertices in the boundary can be colored in grayscale with black for vertices closer to the viewer and white for those further away. In this sense, the areas with the black border pop more out of the background, while the others fade into it. For this, we use a light blue color for the background, or else the whitish sections of the border would completely disappear. An example of this is shown in combination with the map view in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. When regions of the border may overlap the mesh surface in tight areas, the mesh surface is always given priority in being viewed. When the border may overlap itself in some areas, the darker border (indicating closer to the viewer) is always shown on top of the lighter border. A very small border is always maintained around the surface boundary with the corresponding correct depth indication which is not obscured. The bronchial tree in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> contains examples of these overlapping borders and the resulting view. A border was chosen to succinctly provide depth cues without interfering with the surface itself, while at the same time visually separating the surface from the background. The depth border can be turned on or off as desired by the user, and the width of the border can also be adjusted as needed. Note that for the images presented here, the border is kept substantially large so as to clearly appear in the images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Direct Inspection</head><p>For virtual endoscopy applications, it is possible to perform volume rendering of the interior surface on the flattened map, allowing it to be inspected directly in an efficient manner. Such a view allows the user to scan the surface for abnormalities without requiring a virtual flythrough, and ensures that 100% of the surface is viewed. To perform this volumetric ray casting, the original xyz coordinates of the mesh are used to calculate the starting locations of the ray for each vertex within the local coordinate system of the volume. Alternatively, the vertex normal value could be used to define the ray direction. This normal is slightly smoothed with those of the neighboring vertices to account for the discrete nature of the triangular mesh. With these values set at every vertex, the volume positions and ray directions are then interpolated over each triangle in the mesh and used for volume rendering. An example of this is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8(a)</ref>. For other applications, it might be necessary to visualize a color map on the object surface which represents data calculated from or simulated on the mesh. Since the full resolution mesh was mapped to the plane, and not a downsampled version, the color map can be rendered at full quality on the flattened surface without loss of data resolution. An example of this is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8(b)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>The inputs to our algorithm are the original extracted triangular mesh <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, extracted skeleton <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and estimated radii for each node along the skeleton. If these radius values are not known, they can be estimated from the skeleton curve and triangular mesh. For each skeleton point in 3D, rays are cast around it and the closest intersections with the triangular mesh are found and averaged to use as the radius. Using steps of fifteen degree increments for 360 • around the point yields a sufficient radius estimation for satisfactory visual results. Though a relationally accurate unfolding of the surface should provide a distance of one half of the circumference instead of the radius on each side of the planar skeleton, this significantly larger value would cause problems with greater amounts of regions intersecting each other. Using the radius shows the item as narrower in relation to its length, but the width along the object is consistent along the entire skeleton in relation to its original radius. In some sense, this is actually better for guidance maps, as the view remains similar to that of the original 3D mesh view. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figures 9 and 10</ref> shows this technique applied to various datasets and the similarities to the original meshes, albeit without occlusions.</p><p>The projection plane used in the orthographic projection is chosen as a typical view for the object. For most types of objects, especially in medical applications, a canonical view is known which provides the best view and is familiar to the user. If such a view is not known a priori, a plane can be chosen at the discretion of the user, such as one which minimizes structural overlap and skeletal intersections. Due to our boundary adjustment step in the harmonic mapping, inverted vertices are virtually eliminated. Only an extremely small amount remain, which do not affect the final result (less than 0.05% remain inverted). Due to the fixed boundary, a parameterization that is fully shape preserving (i.e., conformal) is not possible, but the resulting mapping is quasi-conformal (i.e., circles are mapped to ellipses).</p><p>The running time for our technique is shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> (in minutes) for the five datasets illustrated in the paper. Also given for each dataset are the number of skeleton nodes and the number of vertices in the final flattened mesh (that is, after slicing). Since we want to ensure that the boundary adjustment grows slowly and thus does not greatly change the shape, we do not use Newton's method to accelerate the harmonic mapping. However, as shown, the running times are reasonable on a modern processor. These times were achieved using an Intel Core i7-3930K processor.</p><p>Though global shape recovery is our goal, this is not always best when the object would be used for direct inspection. As shown in the close-up <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 11(a)</ref>, some regions may become sharply twisted. There are no actual overlaps here (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 11</ref>(c), which shows only the border of the mesh), though such a large twisting of the surface <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Running times (in minutes) for the datasets. The Skeleton Time covers the orthographic projection, radial layout, and shape recovery. The Mesh Time covers the boundary creation and surface mapping.  can be undesirable. This effect can be mitigated in some instances by using a different placement weight based only on the location of the first child node instead of the entire subtree (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 11</ref>(b)).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Skeleton</head><p>We have tested our method on real world datasets of common, naturally occurring, biological structures which are frequently encountered in clinical situations. One can imagine further situations where much more complex structures require such a mapping. Since the planar embedding is based on a radial embedding which is guaranteed to exist, any structure can be mapped. However, extremely large structures might need to make concessions in either the amount of shape recovery possible, the width of the branches in the resulting parameterization, or both. An example of embedding a complicated, yet visually simple, phantom dataset of a cylinder surrounded by a helix is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  12</ref>. Since the 3D lengths of the branches are maintained in the embedding, the result of this is that the spiral branch will be much longer in the 2D embedding, which distorts the relationship between the spiral and the cylinder in the global space. Also, the number of nodes in the skeleton can affect the result, since if there are less nodes over which to distribute the angle modifications, larger distortions of the overall shape can occur. This can be seen in comparing <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 12(b)</ref>-(c), where (b) uses a dense skeleton with 1405 nodes and (c) uses a reduced skeleton with only 351 nodes. The purple circles around each node indicate the estimated radii along the skeleton.</p><p>Compared to typical surface parameterization methods which result in a random, distorted, or unfamiliar shape for the 2D embedding, our technique results in an embedding with a well-defined shape which preserves the global context of the structure from the utilized viewpoint. However, due to the constraints on the boundary for creating this embedding, there can be increased angle and area distortion, especially near the boundaries. Compared to schematic methods, our work allows the overall shape of the structure to be more easily recogniz- </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">EVALUATION</head><p>We have measured the average angular distortion on the parameterized surface. The angle distortion ε f ,θ for a face f is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ε f ,θ = |α f ,p − α f ,o | + |β f ,p − β f ,o | + |γ f ,p − γ f ,o | (4)</formula><p>where </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(α f ,p , β f ,p , γ f ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">ε θ = 1 3| f ∈ M| ∑ f ∈M ε f ,θ<label>(5)</label></formula><p>for a mesh M. The average error values for the meshes are given in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Due to the requirement of a fixed boundary, the result is a parameterization that is quasi-conformal. This can be seen when using the parameterization for texture mapping; circles in the 2D texture image become ellipses when mapped to areas which are distorted on the 3D model (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref>). While the overall global shape is preserved, the spatial distortion from flattening the 3D object to 2D can result in relative distances being inaccurate in the 2D view. Using the depth cues described in Section 4.2 can help to ameliorate for this by indicating that segments are not on the same plane in the original 3D view.</p><p>We have also performed a small informal user study to assess our technique with six users. The user study consisted of two tasks for which the addition of a flattened view could prove advantageous. We view our work as a way of augmenting the traditional 3D model, and not as a replacement for all possible tasks. In the first task, the subject was asked to identify red spots placed randomly on the object, both in 3D and 2D. In the 3D view, the user would be required to rotate the model in order to view its entirety. This task mimics the visual identification of values displayed on a structure's surface, such as tubular flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The purpose of this test was to evaluate the user's accuracy and the amount of time taken to perform the task. Accuracy improved from 88% to over 96% when using the 2D images since the users were able to plainly see all sections. The time required for the test also dropped drastically from an average of 33.8 seconds per dataset to 12.7 seconds per dataset. Again, the ability to efficiently observe the entire structure without tumbling the view contributed to this improvement.</p><p>The second task was to identify which of two points was closer to the user (that is, which is further away from the background), a task that would be useful in endoscopy applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, when using the parameterized surface as a map. The purpose of this task was to evaluate the usefulness of the depth borders by noting the time it took users to make the decision with and without depth borders. When there were no depth borders, the user was required to mentally connect between the 2D and 3D models, often rotating the 3D model to achieve a better view. Using the depth borders allowed the average time for the task to drop from 16.0 seconds to 13.2 seconds. Users also noted that while they were generally able to mentally understand the relationships between the 2D maps and the original 3D structures, the depth cues indeed helped in making their decisions and making them more quickly. However, many subjects still spent at least some time going between the 2D and 3D models even when the depth borders were present. The accuracy was the same in both cases. The results of these two tasks are recorded in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, we have discussed our work with an expert radiologist to obtain anecdotal feedback. He indicated understanding of the global shapes from the planar view and found the depth borders to be intuitive when relatively thin in relation to the structure itself. He suggested a possible use for color coding the surface to represent cross-sectional area (or the local change thereof) for applications such as stent planning. His feedback will be incorporated into our future work, including a more formal study with specific medical applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We have presented a novel method for creating flattened maps of branching structures. Our method is based on obtaining a planar embedding of the object skeleton and then shaping it to match its projected shape from a specified viewpoint. The surface is then sliced open in a manner consistent with the branch locations in the embedded skeleton. Harmonic mapping is used to flatten the object surface to the plane, and the boundary is adjusted during this process to account for regions where the mesh is stretched over concavities. Given the flattened object, several visualization options exist, depending on the needs of the target user. An indication of depth is provided to further aid the user in easily recognizing the structure of the mapped object. We have tested our method on real world datasets and obtained good results with reasonable running times.</p><p>Though we have focused on medical datasets, we foresee that this technique has a wide variety of uses, such as for pipelines, geographic maps, and other domains. In the future, we plan on exploring these other possible uses for this work, as well as performing a more formal user study with domain experts to better quantify the advantages of this technique for certain tasks. We are also interested in extending this work to cyclic structures and determining automatic or semiautomatic methods for choosing optimal projection planes when one is not known. Additionally, we are also investigating possible methods of accelerating the process, both algorithmically and through the use of GPU acceleration.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>The 3D surface mesh of cranial blood vessels.</figDesc></figure>
