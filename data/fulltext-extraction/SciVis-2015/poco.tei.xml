			<abstract>
				<p>Species distribution models (SDM) are used to help understand what drives the distribution of various plant and animal species. These models are typically high dimensional scalar functions, where the dimensions of the domain correspond to predictor variables of the model algorithm. Understanding and exploring the differences between models help ecologists understand areas where their data or understanding of the system is incomplete and will help guide further investigation in these regions. These differences can also indicate an important source of model to model uncertainty. However, it is cumbersome and often impractical to perform this analysis using existing tools, which allows for manual exploration of the models usually as 1-dimensional curves. In this paper, we propose a topology-based framework to help ecologists explore the differences in various SDMs directly in the high dimensional domain. In order to accomplish this, we introduce the concept of maximum topology matching that computes a locality-aware correspondence between similar extrema of two scalar functions. The matching is then used to compute the similarity between two functions. We also design a visualization interface that allows ecologists to explore SDMs using their topological features and to study the differences between pairs of models found using maximum topological matching. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework through several use cases using different data sets and report the feedback obtained from ecologists.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Species distribution models (SDM) combine observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental layers. They are used to gain ecological insights and to predict distributions across various landscapes including terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. They help ecologists answer questions about the relationship between the species and environmental variables.</p><p>There are multiple modeling approaches used for SDMs, some relying more on the traditional least-square and maximum likelihood methods to relate predictors data to the observed data; while some use an iterative, machine learning and Monte Carlo resampling techniques to explore the relationship. The different modeling techniques have varying degrees of complexity and the model to use depends on the goals of the study and the data (primarily the response and the assumptions). However, considering the application of multiple modeling techniques to a common data set can provide insight into the behavior of each modeling approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p><p>Forecast of species' distributions presents substantial discrepancies based on the predictive modeling approach used <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> highlighting the uncertainties associated with these predictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Several studies show that these algorithms can predict substantially different future potential ranges even if current predictions are largely congruent <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. Such model disagreement helps ecologists understand areas where their data or understanding of the system is incomplete and to either guide further investigation of a model, or to identify an implausible model. These discrepancies can also be an important source of uncertainty in model projections to new spatial or temporal extents. It can also help the improvement of methods and / or parameters used for the models. It is therefore important for ecologists to be able to explore in detail the different models and be able to study the differences between them. Problem Definition. SDMs are typically high dimensional scalar functions, where the dimensions correspond to different model algorithms and environment variables, also known as predictors. Ecologists are interested in studying the behavior of these models over their parameter space comprised of their predictors. However, their current approach resorts to visualizing 1-dimensional (1D) slices of the models. That is, in considering the influence of one specific predictor, the common technique is to select a predictor of interest and fix the values of the other predictors to their mean values, and compare the variation of the models with respect to the selected predictor. This results in a 1D curve known as response curve <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> (e.g., see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8</ref>). The main shortcoming of restricting the analysis to considering only one predictor at a time is that it is not possible to obtain an accurate view of the model. This is because, features resulting from the interactions between the other predictors are lost through such dimensionality reduction. More importantly, even when looking at 1D slices, the response curves are restricted to the fixed value of the other predictors. While there has been some work where ecologists analyze two-dimensional slices of the models <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, the above problems still hold. Contributions. The goal of this work is to help ecologists understand the interactions between the predictors in SDMs, and thus have a better understanding of what drives the various species. To this end, we propose the use of computational topology to help explore and compare SDMs directly in the high dimensional domain. In particular, we use the extrema of the corresponding scalar functions to guide the users towards interesting features of the SDM.</p><p>While such exploration of the SDMs will provide more flexibility to the ecologists, manual comparison between the two models is still a time consuming and often impractical process. To overcome this, we propose a novel technique that can be used to compare two scalar functions in a locality-aware manner. We do this by first creating a bipartite graph where the edges correspond to possible correspondences between the extrema of the two functions. The edge weights are defined such that they reflect both the spatial locality of the extrema, as well as the likeness in terms of their function values. The maximum weight matching of the bipartite graph is then computed to obtain the correspondences between the set of extrema. These correspondences are then used to compute a topological similarity measure between the two functions. We also show through experiments the robustness of the matching and the resulting topological similarity measure.</p><p>We design a visualization interface to help ecologists explore SDMs and analyze the differences between them. Finally, working together with ecologists we demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique and the user interface through several use case scenarios involving SDMs of different species. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BACKGROUND</head><p>We now provide the necessary background on concepts from computational topology that form the mathematical and algorithmic basis of this work. We refer the reader to the following textbooks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref> for a comprehensive discussions on these concepts. A species distribution model is a d-dimensional function m :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R d ‚Üí C,</formula><p>where C = [0, 1] denotes the unit interval. It assigns a probability for the presence of a given species based on the values of its d predictors. In the remaining discussion, we assume that the input SDMs are Morse functions. In case the above conditions do not hold, simulated perturbation of the function <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr">Section 1.4]</ref> ensures that no two critical values are equal. Topological persistence. A sub-level set of a function f , M (‚àí‚àû,a] := {x ‚àà M | f (x) ‚â§ a}, is the set of all points having function value less than or equal to a. A super-level set is similarly defined as the preimage of the interval M <ref type="bibr">[a,+‚àû)</ref> .</p><p>Consider the sweep of the function f in increasing order of function value. The topology of the sub-level sets changes when this sweep passes a critical point. In particular, at a critical point, either new topology is generated or some topology is destroyed, where topology is quantified by a class of 'cycles'. For example, a 0-dimensional cycle represents a connected component, a 1-dimensional cycle is a loop that represents a tunnel, and a 2dimensional cycle bounds a void. A critical point is a creator if new topology appears and a destroyer otherwise. One can pair up each creator v 1 uniquely with a destroyer v 2 that destroys the topology created at v 1 . The persistence value of</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">v 1 and v 2 is defined as f (v 2 ) ‚àí f (v 1 )</formula><p>, which intuitively indicates the lifetime of the feature created at v 1 , and thus the importance of</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">v 1 and v 2 .</formula><p>The function in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1(a)</ref> consists of three creator-destroyer pairs -(x 2 , s 1 ),(x 3 , s 2 ), and (x 4 , s 3 ). While the global maximum x 1 has a persistence value of ‚àû, we use a notion of extended persistence where in addition to the above pairs, the global maximum is paired with the global minimum <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The persistence values of the set of maxima x i of the function in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1(a)</ref> is highlighted as œÄ i .</p><p>A B C <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: f 1 and f 2 are two functions defined on the same domain. Existing techniques identify peak C to be similar to A instead of B even though B and C are in the same neighborhood of the domain.</p><p>Topological persistence of a feature measures the amount of simplification required to smooth the input function in order to remove that feature. This property is later used to define a distance measure between two SDMs.</p><p>As mentioned above, in this paper we only consider extreme points of the input function as features. Given an input domain of size n, the persistence of such features can be computed efficiently in O(n log n + nŒ±(n)) time using the union-find data structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Merge trees. A join tree tracks the topology of the super-level sets of the input function, while the split tree tracks the topology of the sub-level sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The join tree and split tree are together known as merge trees. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1(b)</ref> shows the join tree of the function shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1(a)</ref>. The join / split tree is computed using the union-find data structure to keep track of the connected components of the superlevel set (or the sub-level set). This procedure also returns the set of creator-destroyer pairs corresponding to the topological features.</p><p>A merge tree can be decomposed into a set of branches using the obtained critical point pairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Each branch corresponds to the path in the merge tree between a creator-destroyer critical point pair. Thus, the height of a branch represents the persistence of the corresponding critical points. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1(c)</ref> shows the branch decomposition of the join tree in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1(b)</ref>. The smoothing of a function obtained by removing an extremum can be represented abstractly by removing the branch corresponding to that extremum together with all its sub-branches. This observation is key in our algorithm that computes the topological similarity measure between two SDMs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RELATED WORK</head><p>In this section, we first briefly discuss related work that are used to explore high dimensional functions. Next, we survey topology based techniques that are used for comparing two scalar functions. Exploring High Dimensional Functions There are multiple visual analytic techniques to explore the parameter space of high dimensional scalar functions (also referred to as models). Most of these methods are based on sampling the parameter space or using regression algorithms to approximate / predict output from unknown configurations. Matkovic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> proposed to visualize multirun data as families of data surfaces (with respect to pairs of independent dimensions) in combination with projections and aggregation of the data surfaces at different levels. The same authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> also proposed to generate new sample points by interactively narrowing down the control parameters in the visualization via brushing to support visual steering of a simulation. Along the same lines HyperMoVal <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> was designed to visually relate one or more high-dimensional scalar functions with validation data. Later, Berger et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> extended HyperMoVal using regression models for a continuous exploration of the sample parameter space. Similarly, we can find applications of parameter exploration in other domains such as image segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Other approaches partitioned the input space and provided visual analytics strategies for exploration of the input space using one or two parameters at the time <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Some work has been done in exploring and understanding the differences in model simulations. For example, Poco et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> propose the SimilarityExplorer tool for a visual comparison of the model output but they do not explore the input parameter space. However, all of these approaches require users to manually explore the space in order to identify interesting regions.</p><p>Topological abstractions have also been used to create visual representations of high dimensional functions. Topological Landscapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> provided a 2D terrain representation having the same contour tree as the input high-dimensional scalar function. When the input are point clouds Oesterling et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> proposed to reconstruct the scalar function using density kernels and used topological landscapes to visualize the density of points using a 2D terrain. Geber et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> segmented the input domain using an approximate Morse-Scale complex on a cloud of point samples. Then each segment was represented by a curve using a regression. Finally those curves were visualized in 2D space using dimensionality reduction algorithms. While these techniques helped users understand the topology of the involved function, it was difficult to use these methods to compare scalar functions as the neighborhood information was lost in the transformation to a 2D representation.</p><p>In the ecology domain, while there has been some work on trying to study two-dimensional slices of SDMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, ecologists mostly use the SAHM package <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> which supports exploration through 1D response curves. Comparing Scalar Functions Early methods of comparing scalar functions directly used the persistence of the critical points of the functions to do so. A distance function, usually bottleneck distance, between the persistence diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> of two functions are used to compare them. Using an alternate representation, called barcode, Carlsson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> represented the persistence of the features as intervals on a real line. They then defined a metric to compute the similarity between two barcodes. A disadvantage of using a pure persistence based measure is that they do not capture the neighborhoods of the features.</p><p>More recent methods for comparing scalar functions used some form of topological abstraction of the scalar functions to compare them. Morozov et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> defined the interleaving distance between two merge trees as the minimum cost of shifting points in one tree to obtain a mapping of one tree to the other. Beketayev et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> defined a distance between two merge trees by comparing all possible branch decompositions of the two trees. Bauer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> extended the interleaving distance between two merge trees to Reeb graphs and proposed the functional distortion distance to compare two Reeb graphs, where a Reeb graph is a topological structure which tracks the connectivity of level sets of a scalar function with increasing function value. More recently Narayanan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> proposed a distance measure between two scalar functions based on the maximum common subgraph between complete extremum graphs, where an extremum graph is a topological data structure that captures proximity between extreme points in a scalar field <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. While extremum graphs naturally encode locations of extrema and saddles, it is with respect to a single function. The usefulness of this locality information is not clear when comparing two functions. Alternative to computing distance measures, topological structures have also been used to structurally compare two functions. Multi-resolution Reeb graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> as well as Morse-Smale complexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> have been used for comparing two shapes. Saikia et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> introduced a data structure called extended branch decomposition graphs using which they could compare between all sub-trees of two merge trees. Topological abstractions have also been used to identify similar structures within a scalar function <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</p><p>While the above methods capture adjacency based on the connectivity between level sets, they still suffer from two shortcomings. First, it is possible for two adjacent features (adjacent edges) to actually be far from each other. Second and more importantly, the actual locality of the features identified as similar need not be located in the same locality of the domain, which is a requirement for the target application. For example, consider the two functions shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. the above techniques would identify maximum A in f 1 with C in f 2 even though the two maxima are far from each other. However, given that B and C are in a similar locality of the domain, we are interesting in identifying B with C.</p><p>Instead of an abstraction, level sets and their properties have also been used for comparing scalar functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. Since these techniques require computing the level sets, extending them to work for high dimensional functions is non-trivial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">SCALAR FUNCTION SIMILARITY</head><p>We now describe our technique to compare two scalar functions that are defined on the same domain. The main idea is to identify the best match, in terms of the location and function value, between the set of extrema (of the same type) of the two functions. This matching is then used to compute the similarity measures between the functions.</p><p>In this section, we first describe the procedure to identify the correspondence between the set of extrema of two functions. Next we define two similarity measures between the functions and describe how they are computed using the found correspondences. Without loss of generality, the techniques in this section are described with respect to the set of maxima of the functions. The same procedures apply to the set of minima as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Maximum Topology Matching</head><p>The first stage in identifying the similarity between two scalar functions f 1 and f 2 is to identify the correspondence between the extrema of the functions. Intuitively, two similar functions will have the same topology and hence the same number of extrema. Thus, the goal is to get the "best" match possible in the sense that there is one-to-one mapping between the extrema of the two functions. Without loss of generality, we assume that the two functions are normalized between 0 and 1.</p><p>Let M + 1 and M + 2 be the set of maxima of f 1 and f 2 respectively. We first create a complete weighted bi-partite graph</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">G T (M + 1 , M + 2 , E + )</formula><p>in which the two partitions corresponds to the maxima of the two functions respectively. Consider a pair of maxima a ‚àà M + 1 and b ‚àà M + 2 . Let the difference between their function values be Œ¥ a,b = | f 1 (a) ‚àí f 2 (b)|. Let d g (a, b) denote the distance between the pair of maxima. Since the SDM is defined on R d , we use the Euclidean distance for this purpose. We assign a weight w a,b to the edge corresponding to the pair of maxima a and b as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">w a,b = (1 ‚àí Œ¥ a,b ) √ó exp(d g (a, b) 2 /r 2 ).</formula><p>Here, r is a cut-off radius, which acts as a knob to define the neighborhood sensitivity.</p><p>The weight w a,b essentially consists of two parts. A high value of (1 ‚àí Œ¥ a,b ) implies a high similarity between the two maxima in terms of their function value. The weighting term exp(d g (a, b) 2 /r 2 ) ensures that importance is given to pairs of maxima that are closer to each other, thus preserving the neighborhood locality. Thus a high weight between a pair of maxima implies that they are similar not only in terms of their function value, but are also within the same locality of the domain. For example, in order to compare function f 2 shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3(a)</ref> with function f 1 from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1(a)</ref>, we create the bipartite graph shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3(b)</ref>. The thickness of the edges represents their weights. Note that the edges corresponding to maxima pair that are nearby in the function domain have weight higher than those that are further away.</p><p>We next compute the maximum weighted matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> on the graph G. A matching is defined as a set of pairwise non-adjacent edges. A maximum weighted matching is defined as a matching where the sum of values of the edges in the matching has maximum value. The resultant matching provides the correspondence between the set of maxima of the two functions. For the example of functions f 1 and f 2 , the obtained matching is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3(c)</ref>. Note that our technique matches the maxima x 1 to y 2 and x 2 to y 1 due to their proximity. This is unlike existing techniques that do not use the locality information to match features, which would have matched x 1 to y 1 and x 2 to y 2 . Also, these techniques would have matched x 3 to y 3 since they use the relative persistence of features when computing similarity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Similarity Measures</head><p>Topological Similarity. The topological similarity between f 1 and f 2 is defined as the effort required to make the two functions have the same number of maxima in the same neighborhood of the domain. Such functions will produce a perfect matching in G, that matches all vertices of the bipartite graph. This quantity is measured as the minimum amount of simplification that is to be performed to attain such a perfect matching.</p><p>Consider the function f 1 having the set M + 1 as its maxima. Let C ‚äÜ M + 1 be the set of maxima that have a corresponding match in M + 2 . Then C = M + 1 \ C is the set of maxima that have to be simplified. The join tree and the appropriate branch decomposition is used to compute, œÑ 1 , the amount of simplification required as follows. Let r o be the root of the join tree T S . That is, r o is the global minimum of the function f 1 . In the first step, we construct the matching tree T S , the join tree of f 1 which is the function f 1 in which the set of maxima C are removed (simplified). This tree is constructed as follows: 1. For each maximum m ‚àà C, construct the path L m , which is the unique path from the leaf corresponding to m to the root r o . 2. the matching tree T S ‚äÇ T S is the tree induced by the paths L m computed above, i.e., {T S = m‚ààC L m } <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4(b)</ref> shows the matching tree computed from the join tree in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4(a)</ref>. Here, three maxima were matched in the bipartite graph.</p><p>Let T S = T S \ T S . Consider the connected components K of T S . Simplifying the set of maxima in C is equivalent to removing each of these connected components from T S . These components corresponds to a connected sub-tree of T S . The effort œÑ k required for simplifying a given component k is equal to the height of the largest branch of the corresponding sub-tree. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4(c)</ref> shows the different components that have to be simplified for the example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4(a)</ref>. In case one of the noisy maximum y j is matched in the maximum matching, then the amount of simplification needed to remove y j is bounded by Œµ, while the simplification needed for other extraneous maxima is bounded by 2Œµ. œÑ 1 is then computed as the maximum value of œÑ k over all components k ‚àà K. œÑ 2 , the minimum amount of simplification required for function f 2 is computed in a similar manner. The topological similarity œÑ = max(œÑ 1 , œÑ 2 ) is the minimum simplification required to obtain a perfect matching between the two functions. Functional Similarity Given a perfect matching between the maxima of the two topologically similar functions, it is still possible that the matched maxima could differ in their function values. The functional similarity measures this difference. Formally, the functional similarity œÜ is the maximum Œ¥ a,b over all edges (a, b) that are part of the matching. Intuitively, this quantity is used to measure the maximum amount of change required to construct functionally similar functions from topologically similar functions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Implementation</head><p>In order to efficiently compute the topology of a species distribution model m : R d ‚Üí C, the high-dimensional domain of m is approximated as a nearest-neighbor graph, G, of a set of points sampled uniformly, using Latin Hypercube Sampling, from the domain of R d . m is then represented as piece-wise linear (PL) function defined on Gm : G ‚Üí C. The function is defined on the vertices of the graph and linearly interpolated within each edge.</p><p>We use the sweep algorithm by Carr et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> to compute the merge trees, which can be accomplished in O(n log n + mŒ±(m)) time. Here, n and m are the number of vertices and edges, respectively, in G and Œ± is the inverse Ackermann function. Let the number of extrema in the two functions, f 1 and f 2 , be t 1 = O(n 1 ) and t 2 = O(n 2 ) respectively. The created bipartite graph has n v = t 1 +t 2 nodes and n e = t 1 √ó t 2 edges. Computing the maximum weight matching can be accomplished in O(n 2 v log n v + n v n e ) using Dijkstra's algorithm with a Fibonacci heap <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Even though the time complexity is cubic, we achieve interactive running times in practice for computing the matching (see supplemental document).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Effect of Noise</head><p>Noise-based artifacts are common in real world data sets. It is therefore important to consider the effect of noise to the stability of the matching, and the resulting similarity measures. If the original matching remains even with noise, then given the low persistence of the noisy extrema that are added, there is no significant change to the similarity measures. So let us assume that the matching is different from the original. Consider a matched pair of maxima (x i , y j ) between functions f 1 and f 2 . Without loss of generality, assume that there was noise introduced into the function f 2 . This would potentially create additional maxima in the neighborhood of y j . Let the effect on the function value variation due to the noise be bounded by Œµ f . Depending on the changes in the weights, the following scenarios are possible. 1. The matching (x i , y j ) does not change due to noise. 2. The matching algorithm pairs x i with a maximum y j in the neighborhood of y j . In this case, both œÑ and œÜ change by a maximum of Œµ f . This is because, y j is in the resulting matching tree, and y j has to be simplified. The persistence of y j in the new configuration is then bounded by the change in function value (See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5</ref>), which in the worst case is 2Œµ f . 3. The matching pairs x i with y k not in the neighborhood of y j .</p><p>This implies that weight of the edge (x i , y k ) managed to increase past the weight of edge (x i , y j ), i.e., w x i ,y j ‚âà w x i ,y k . While the weight of the matching in this case would not significantly change, the values of œÑ and œÜ could be affected. We are interested in further exploring Case 3 above when the maximum y j as well as the set of maxima y j that was created (due to noise) in the neighborhood of y j remains unmatched. If at least one of them is matched to another maximum x i , then the change to œÑ would be similar to Case 2 above.</p><p>Since the function values are between 0 and 1, the weights of the edges in G is always between 0 and 1. When the weights of the edges under consideration are low, there are three possibilities: 1. Both y j and y k are far away from x i ; or 2. One of the maxima, say y j is far from x i but has Œ¥ ‚âà 0, and for y k , Œ¥ is high while it is within the neighborhood of x i ; or 3. Both maxima are in the neighborhood of x i , but have very high Œ¥ (close to 1). All the above three cases produce an uneven match, i.e., the matched pair significantly differ in function values, or are not in the neighborhood of each other. In order to avoid such matches, we perform an additional pruning step to remove such low weight edges from the bipartite graph. Thus this step ensures that there is no significant change in the similarity measures in such cases. Note that we use a value of 10 ‚àí6 in this filtration step, thus ensuring that significant matched pairs are not removed.</p><p>On the other hand, let the weights of the edges under consideration be high. Given the exponential decrease in the weights with respect to distance between the maxima, we can safely assume that the two maxima are in the neighborhood of x i . Assuming that r is small (we use 0.1 in our experiments), we can safely infer that the two function values are similar (and high). Thus, there is no effect on œÜ . Let s be a saddle that can be reached through a descending path from both y j and y k . If there are no other matches in both the sub-trees, from y j to s and from y k to s, then there is no change to œÑ. In case there are other matches, then the persistence of the two maxima in their respective sub-trees decides the maximum change in œÑ, which is bounded by |œÄ y k ‚àí œÄ y j |. As we show next, we found that in practice the changes to œÑ was indeed small due to noise. Experiments In order to test the robustness to noise, we perform three types of experiments. In the first experiment, we fix a function f 1 , and artificially induce noise to f 1 to obtain a noisy function f * 1 . The amount of noise induced was bounded by Œµ = 10 ‚àí4 . We then compute the similarity measures between f 1 and f * 1 . Ideally the topological similarity œÑ should be zero. We performed this experiment for the different models across three data sets. The mean and standard deviation of œÑ across these tests were 1.18 √ó 10 ‚àí4 and 4.05 √ó 10 ‚àí5 respectively. Note that this is less than the 2Œµ bound.</p><p>In the second experiment, we consider pairs of functions, f 1 and f 2 . We induce noise into one of the functions, say f * 2 = f 2 + noise. We then computed the similarity between f 1 and f * 2 . Again, œÑ between f 1 and f 2 should be the same as f 1 and f * 2 (i.e. the difference should be 0). In this scenario, we found the mean difference in the topological similarity to be 6.42 √ó 10 ‚àí5 and standard deviation to be 6.29 √ó 10 ‚àí5 .</p><p>The final experiment considers the effect of noise to the locations of the extrema. We perturb the locations of the underlying graph (bounded by 10 ‚àí4 ), and compute the similarity between the different pairs of functions. We then measure the difference between œÑ before and after perturbation. The mean and standard deviation of the difference in œÑ in this case was 7.8 √ó 10 ‚àí4 and 8 √ó 10 ‚àí4 respectively. When looking at individual errors in all of the above experiments, we found that in several cases, there was no change in œÑ demonstrating the robustness of the measure to noise. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">EXPLORATION FRAMEWORK</head><p>We design a visual interface to help ecologists explore multiple SDMs. We accomplish this through the use of multiple visualizations. The interface consists of 4 views.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Properties View</head><p>A matrix is used to represent various properties of different models, as well as the difference between pairs of models. The diagonal of this matrix represents the properties of the individual models. The functional distance œÜ between the pairs of models is represented in the upper triangular matrix, while the topological distance œÑ is represented in the lower triangular matrix. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7(a)</ref> shows the properties view for the three sample functions shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6</ref>. In case of functions f 1 and f 2 , the difference is the presence of peak x 3 in f 1 , which contributes to the topological similarity. In case of f 2 and f 3 , peak equivalent to z 3 is missing in f 2 , while a peak equivalent to y 1 is missing in f 3 . However, the simplification required to remove z 3 is greater than that required for y 1 , which is denoted by their topological similarity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Features View</head><p>This view visualizes the topological features of the selected model(s) as a scatter plot. The choice of scatter plot was motivated by the simplicity of the persistence diagram and the fact that the ecologists were familiar with scatter plots. Each point in the scatter plot corresponds to a topological feature (maximum or minimum). The axes of the scatter plot are defined based on what the user wants to explore, and the maxima and minima are represented as upward pointing and downward pointing triangles respectively. Explore single model. In this case, the x-axis of the model corresponds to the persistence (topological significance) of the extrema, while the y-axis corresponds to its function value. This allows the user to choose features during the exploration. For example, in case users are not interested in extrema with a small function value, then they can focus at the appropriate portion of the plot. The extrema of the function f 1 is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7(b)</ref>-left. Explore similarities between two models. In this case, each point in the scatter plot corresponds to a pair of extrema that are similar, that is, the pair of extrema that match. The axes corresponds to the function values of the two extrema. This view also provides the intuition for the functional similarity. A functionally similar pair of functions should have all points along the diagonal in this plot. Divergence from the diagonal denotes a disparity in the function values between the two functions in the parameter space in the neighborhood of the extreme points. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7(b)</ref>-middle illustrates the different matches found between f 1 and f 2 (also see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3(c)</ref>). Explore differences between two models. In this case, each point in the scatter plot corresponds to an extremum that is present in one function but absent in the other. The color of the point denotes the function it is part of. The x-axis corresponds to the topological similarity measure, while the y-axis corresponds to the function value. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7</ref>(b)-right shows the difference between functions f 1 and f 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Parallel Coordinates View</head><p>Once features of interest are chosen, the spatial region in the domain corresponding to the selected features is visualized using the  parallel coordinates view. This view provides information on the location of the selected extrema in the high dimensional space. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7(c)</ref>-left illustrates the locations of all maxima of the function f 1 . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7</ref>(c)-middle and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7(c)</ref>-right show the matched maxima and the differing maximum respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Response Curve View</head><p>As mentioned in Section 1, a response curve represents a one dimensional slice of the function. We include this view in our interface since it helps the ecologists understand the different features as they are familiar with this representation. By selecting a feature and a predictor of interest from the parallel coordinate view, the user can view the response curves with respect to the selected predictor. The values of the other predictors are set to those corresponding to the selected extremum. We also show the response curve of the critical point pair corresponding to an extremum. This helps users understand how the function changes. For example, when viewing a minimum-saddle pair, the upward movement of the response curve indicates the approximate shape of the corresponding "valley" in the high dimensional space. Comparing MARS with other models for the Brewers Sparrow species. Note that multiple significant minima that are present in MARS are not present in the other models. Also, these constitute the significant differences between these models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CASE STUDIES</head><p>In this section we describe two use case scenarios that are of interest to ecologists. The first case shows how the extrema in the different models can be used to guide ecologists towards interesting features of the model. The second case demonstrates how our similarity comparison technique can be used to identify differences between the models that are otherwise difficult to find. We use two 8-dimensional data sets, Brewers Sparrow and Sagebrush, for the experiments in this section <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>(see Supplemental document for a description of the data).</p><p>Exploring an SDM. In this use case, the user is interested in exploring the properties of a single SDM. Using the visual interface, the user first selects the species and model algorithm of interest. In this experiment, the user chooses the MARS model for the Brewers Sparrow species <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8(a)</ref> shows the set of extrema of this model. An initial simplification is performed to remove noise/less significant extrema. Note that for the MARS model, there are a high number of significant minima. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8(b)</ref> shows the different predictors corresponding to the set of selected minima. It is interesting to note that all of these minima occur when combination of values of mix_18km is low and tri_18km is high. Such a behavior is clearly not visible using the default response curves <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8(c)</ref>. Exploring differences between given pair of models of a fixed Species. In this experiment, the user first selects the pair of models that are to be compared from the Properties view. The user can now view either the non-matched features or the matched features. The first experiment considers the differences between MARS and other models for the Brewers Sparrow species. Users can filter features (extrema) having low topological similarity. As shown in the previous use case, the MARS model for Brewers Sparrow contains a large number of significant minima. It can be seen than these minima do not match with any minima of the other models, i.e., there exists no minima in the other models in the corresponding locations. This is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 9</ref> where we look at the different extrema in the features view. Let us now select a significant difference between GLM and MARS (having high value of œÑ).   shows the coordinates of the minimum-saddle pair (intuitively the lowest and highest point of the valley corresponding to the minimum) that is present in MARS, but absent in GLM. The response curves varying the predictor ndvi_270 at the minimum and saddle points shows a significant increase in the shape of the curve indicating a "valley"-like structure in MARS. However, we see a slight decrease in the response curve for GLM indicating the absence of a minimum in that region (and thus the difference).</p><p>In the next experiment, the user compares the differences between MARS and BRT for Sagebrush <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In particular, the user selects the set of significant maxima (having topological similarity &gt; 0.15) in MARS that are not present in BRT <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 11(a)</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11(b)</ref> shows the coordinates corresponding to these maxima. Note that all of these differences occur when the value of mean_summer is low. This is counter intuitive when one looks at the default response curves of these two models ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11(d)</ref>). Feedback from Ecologists. When we initially provided our tool to the ecologists, they found the results to be a little too abstract and had difficulty in comprehending them. To help them get familiar and better understand the utility of working directly in the high dimensional space, we used a two dimensional slice of the different models, and setup the software to work with this data. Their familiarity with the features in low dimensions allowed them to relate to the results from our tool. Also, since they could easily visualize the 2D data, the different features were directly apparent.</p><p>An immediate advantage they found using our tool was in being able to see patterns that was not possible before. This utility is reflected in the following comment -"the following is an example in which the 1D response curves were inadequate: With the spruce fir is that one of the predictors (mean gt 38) has a very large point mass of presence at 0 and all other values for that predictor are associated with absence so if I look at response curves in SAHM holding all predictors constant at their mean then I get flat lines at 0 because as long as mean gt 38 is at its mean value the predicted value is 0 no matter what the other predictors are."</p><p>The examples presented in the previous section highlight the complexity of the response surface when considering an eight dimensional space (that is, using eight predictor variables) and clearly provide new information about the various models used by the ecologists. However, the implications of some of these results was not immediately apparent, which we plan to explore further in the future. As an ecologist collaborator mentioned during one of our interactions, "looking at models this way is interesting for me. With our current tools for the example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref>, we wouldn't have otherwise known that it was at low values of mean summer that the models differed and that might be of interest in an in depth study".</p><p>In some cases when there is a difference between two models, it is possible that this is due to missing data. In such cases ecologists would have to collect additional data from regions having the differences. So, such a tool can also help in identifying these regions of discrepancies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Discretization of a high dimensional function. Identifying an ideal sample size to represent a high dimensional function is a difficult problem. For all the experiments in this paper, we used a sample size of 10 5 points. We chose this size since we found that the similarity measure computed did not significantly change even on increasing the sample size to above 10 5 . This is because increasing the sample size only created noisy extrema which did not affect the similarity measures.</p><p>Each dimension of an SDM corresponds to an environmental variable, which have a well defined range of values. Given this, the domain space of the SDM would correspond to the Euclidean subspace corresponding to these ranges. However, since the units of these variables differ, we normalize the ranges between 0 and 1 in order to be consistent. Alternatively it will be interesting to explore other possibilities, such as standardizing the inputs instead. Neighborhood radius. The neighborhood radius used for weighing the edge weights of the bipartite graph is largely dependent on the application and domain expertise. We used a neighborhood radius r = 0.1 for this purpose, and was based on discussions with the ecologists, who did not want the matching features to be far away. Typically, with increasing r, the number of matches between similar (in terms of function value) extrema that are farther away would increase. This would potentially decrease the functional similarity between two models. In case of topological similarity, it could both increase as well as decrease. It would increase if the larger r causes a nearby but high persistent extrema that was earlier matched to not be matched. It could also decrease, since more matches are possible, thus causing less number of extrema to be simplified. We plan to investigate this further in the future, to be able to automatically identify an appropriate radius. Conclusions. With the focus on helping ecologists better understand SDMs, we design a topology based framework that helps guide them towards interesting features of the model. We also propose the concept of maximum topology matching that can be used to identify similarities and differences between a given pair of SDMs. Even though the focus was on the ecology domain, our technique is general and can be applied in cases requiring a localityaware way of comparing scalar functions. While we found that our similarity measures were stable under the influence of noise in practice, it is still possible to obtain discontinuities in rare cases. We plan to investigate this further and try to obtain a stable measure. It will also be interesting to consider topological splines as a visual metaphor to represent SDMs, and using it to show the identified similarities and differences. We are currently working with our collaborators in an ecology related paper that further investigates the implications of the results obtained. In future, we are also interested in exploring the generality of our similarity technique.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Topology of scalar functions.

Given a smooth, realvalued function f : M ‚Üí R defined on M, the critical points of f are exactly where the gradient becomes zero. The function f is a Morse function if it satisfies the following conditions [26]: (1) All critical points of f are non-degenerate and lie in the interior of M; (2) All critical points of the restriction of f to the boundary of M are nondegenerate; and (3) All critical values are distinct i.e., f (p) = f (q) for all critical points p = q. For a Morse function f defined on a d-manifold M, there are d + 1 types of critical points indexed from 0 to d. In this work, we are interested in the two most familiar types -minimum (with index 0) and maximum (with index d), corresponding to a point p whose function value is smaller, or larger, than all other points within a sufficiently small neighborhood of p, respectively. Fig. 1(a) shows a height function, f 1 , defined on a 2-manifold. This function consists of 4 maxima -x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , and x 4 .</figDesc></figure>
