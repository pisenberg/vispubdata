<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Superconductors, materials that can conduct current without any loss, are used in applications ranging from MRI machines to particle accelerators. Materials scientists are interested in understanding and controlling the complex dynamic properties of superconductors. Designing superconductors that can sustain higher lossless, or critical, currents at higher temperatures could lead to technological advances affecting low-cost power transmission in the electrical grid, computing technology, and improved electromagnets.</p><p>In the Ginzburg-Landau theory for superconductivity, the superconducting properties of the material can be expressed in terms of the order parameter ψ (ψ ∈ C), which is a complex-valued scalar field. The value of ψ is related to the density of superconducting components. Singularities of ψ correspond to an extremely important feature of the superconductor, magnetic flux vortices. The dynamics of the vortices fundamentally determine the electromagnetic response of the material. Above a critical level, an externally applied magnetic field penetrates a type-II superconductor in the form of flexible flux tubes. The magnetic flux in the vortex core is surrounded by a circular supercurrent. When the vortices move, the system becomes dissipative; and a finite voltage drop across the system, corresponding to resistance, is observed. Thus, the behavior of the vortices is an important determinant of the performance of the material. Material defects, or so-called inclusions, distributed through the type-II superconductor can trap the vortices, pinning them in place and allowing the material to sustain a higher current.</p><p>Extracting, tracking, and visualizing the vortex dynamics in largescale time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) superconductor simulation data are needed in order to understand the dissipative material behavior and the impact of adding material inclusions. Until recently, numerical simulations have been limited to 2D <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> or small-scale 3D <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> domains. Now, large-scale 3D simulations have been implemented <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> in which macroscale phenomena can be observed, including collective dynamics of many vortices. Materials and computational scientists have developed two TDGL models for structured and unstructured meshes, respectively.In order to determine how vortex dynamics relate to the macroscopically observable system behaviors in large-scale TDGL simulations, however, new methods are required for extracting and visualizing complex vortex motions. In our work, we demonstrate how the vortex extraction and tracking algorithms, together with visualization applications, can elucidate the details of a periodic dissipative vortex state that emerges under certain field and material sample conditions.</p><p>The core part of this work is vortex extraction and tracking in 3D time-varying, complex-valued scalar fields. We define extraction to mean detecting features in a single time frame and tracking to mean correlating and connecting the features over time. In a recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, a vortex extraction algorithm was proposed for a single time frame, yet challenges remain for tracking vortices over time. This topic is related to but fundamentally different from vortex extraction in fluid flow. Although much studied in flow visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, vortices in 3D vector fields are not well defined and have multiple criteria, for example, local extrema of vorticity magnitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, and λ 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In contrast, the vortex line in the complex-valued scalar field of a superconductor is well defined and is the locus of singularity points that satisfy</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">|ψ| = 0 and − C ∇θ • dl = 2nπ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where |ψ| and θ are the magnitude and phase angle, respectively, of the order parameter ψ, and C is a simple closed contour in R 3 encircling a vortex, which is small enough to avoid any other singularities of ψ.</p><p>The nonzero integer n, which is usually ±1, is defined as the chirality of the vortex line with respect to the contour C. In the rest of the paper, the term vortex means a singularity line in a complex-valued scalar field, unless otherwise noted. We propose a vortex extraction algorithm for both structured and unstructured mesh TDGL simulations. We generalize the previous work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> to extract vorticies in both structured and unstructred mesh data. Singularity points are detected on mesh faces on either a tetrahedron or a hexahedron, and they are further transformed into vortex lines based on mesh connectivities.</p><p>We develop a vortex tracking algorithm for identifying the same vortex lines over time. Spatial faces of 3D hexahedral or tetrahedral cells are extruded to space-time virtual prisms that are then checked for intersection by vortices, which indicate the movement of vortices. By exploiting the face connectivities of prisms, the singularities in adjacent time frames can be related. Vortex lines in adjacent frames are thereby sewn together, unless a topological event such as a split, merge, or recombination occurs. In the tracking algorithm, the only assumption is that the simulation output varies smoothly over time. A rigorous proof of correctness of our tracking method is provided, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm. Compared with other feature tracking algorithms in general, our method is parameter free and guarantees the correctness of the results within the accuracy of the output data. While our method is related to earlier studies on tracking critical points in 2D time-varying vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and tensor fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, significant challenges arise in our 3D TDGL data. In vector fields, critical points can be located by searching where velocity vanishes, but vortices in superconductors are localized by checking the phase jump of the contour integral (Eq. 1). The higher dimensionality of the 3D mesh is more complex than in 2D cases. Gauge invariance (discussed in Section 3) also needs to be incorporated in the algorithms for numerical reasons.</p><p>In addition, based on the vortex extraction and tracking results, we further apply and develop visualization techniques for interactive data exploration. An event diagram is provided to scientiststhat explains the changes in vortex topology. It also enables locating interesting features over time. The visual design is inspired by Storylines <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Important measurements such as voltage are also overlaid in the view as line charts, in order to show the relationship between the vortex events and macroscopic system behaviors. A prototype system is implemented that contains both 3D visualization and event diagrams.</p><p>To summarize, the contributions of this paper are as follows:</p><p>• A vortex detection algorithm for both structured and unstructured mesh TDGL simulations; • A vortex tracking algorithm for visualizing and analyzing vortex dynamics and events in the datasets; • Application of various visualization techniques for analyzing and understanding the results of the vortex detection and tracking.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We summarize related work in Section 2 and then introduce our particular scientific problem and its corresponding simulation data in Section 3. Vortex extraction and tracking algorithms are detailed in Section 4. The visualization tool is presented in Section 5. Results and performance are evaluated in Section 6, followed by discussions in Section 7. In Section 8, we summarize our conclusions and briefly discuss future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>We summarize related work on complex-valued scalar field visualization and vortex visualization in fluid flow. In general, a complexvalued scalar field ψ : R n → C associates a complex scalar with every point in the space (usually R 2 or R 3 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Complex-valued scalar field visualization</head><p>Complex fields are found in various science and engineering domains, for example, quantum mechanics, superconductivity, superfluidity, string theory, acoustics, and optics. Relatively little research, however, has been done to visualize and extract features from such fields. We categorize complex field visualization into two categories: direct and feature/topology-based visualization methods.</p><p>Direct visualization approaches map data values into visual properties so that they can be directly interpreted.Pseudocolor plots, isosurfaces, and contours have been used to visualize quantum physics data <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. 2D vector field visualization methods, such as arrow plots and line integral convolution (LIC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, can be used to visualize complex fields, but their extension to 3D creates occlusion problems. Production tools such as the Application Visualization System (AVS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, ParaView <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and VisIt <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> have been used to facilitate such visualizations. In previous studies of TDGL simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, vortices have been visualized by heat maps or isosurfaces of the magnitude |ψ|. These methods are problematic, however, as the datasets become larger and contain more features. Isosurfaces and volume rendering, as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>, usually blur the fine features of a vortex and merge when two vortices are in close proximity. Additionally, |ψ| usually is suppressed within inclusions such that vortices cannot be visualized inside them.</p><p>An alternative is to use feature-and topology-based visualization to extract important structures and regions in the datasets, for example, valleys and ridges in complex-valued acoustical fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Vortices correspond to singularities in ψ, isolated points and lines in 2D and 3D, respectively. The extraction of singularity points has been studied in complex optical fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. For TDGL datasets, Phillips et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> proposed a method to extract singularity lines from structured Cartesian grid TDGL simulation data. By interpreting the data as a graph, individual singularity points are connected to form lines. We extend this work with a tracking algorithm for both structured and unstructured mesh data. This algorithm is also related to 2D vector field and tensor field singularity tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>, where 2D faces are extended to space-time prisms in order to check whether the features pass through the boundaries. In our work, however, we must account for application-specific mesh and feature complexities that are present in 3D TDGL simulations such as vortex chirality, gauge transformations, and a 3D mesh complex, as well as the large data scales of our application's datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Vortex visualization in fluid flow</head><p>Vortex visualization is a well-studied topic in flow visualization, and a comprehensive literature review on this topic can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. In general, vortices are characterized by swirling motion centers in fluid flow; however, this process can be mathematically defined in various ways. Several definitions have been proposed, such as extrema of λ 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, vorticity magnitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, and acceleration magnitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>The two main vortex extraction approaches in fluid flow are region based and line based, which extract the vortices as regions and core lines, respectively. In region-based methods, vortices are located by thresholding the aforementioned characteristic scalar fields. Using related ideas, Jiang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> proposed a swirling region detection method based on combinatorial topology, and Otto and Theisel <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> introduced uncertain vortex regions. In comparison, in line-based methods, the center of vortical motions are extracted as lines. Most line-based approaches can be generalized as extracting parallel vector descriptors from a dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. For example, a vortex core line can be defined by a locus of points, where velocity is parallel to vorticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, or as the extrema lines of pressures, where pressure gradient is parallel to vorticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Alternatively, predictor-corrector methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> can be used to locate vortex lines in an iterative manner.</p><p>Vortex tracking is necessary in order to analyze unsteady flow fields. For vortex regions, the same techniques used in scalar field feature tracking can be used, such as scale-space methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and connected regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. For vortex core lines, Theisel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> proposed parallel vector surfaces to track them in space-time, which is built on the feature flow fields (FFF) framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Similar techniques are used to track the vortices as cores of swirling motions <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>An essential difference exists between fluid flow vortices and vortices in a superconductor. The former are a classical mechanics phenomenon, while the latter are an emergent quantum physics phenomenon. Vortices in fluid flow are usually extracted by a local operator (e.g., extrema or parallel vectors), but vortices in superconductors are localized by the contour integral (Eq. 1), which is a non-local operator. Unlike fluid flow, we cannot determine whether a point is on a vortex line by merely checking whether |ψ| = 0. Thus, local operator based vortex extraction and tracking frameworks in fluid flow, such as parallel vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and FFF <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, cannot be directly used for our problem. In this paper, we extract vortices and their movements by examining phase jumps over mesh faces and space-time edges and then connect them with a graph-based algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">TDGL SUPERCONDUCTOR SIMULATION DATA</head><p>In this section we introduce the properties of TDGL superconductor simulation data. The notation used in this paper is listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>The input data in our study comes from two TDGL implementations, GLGPU and Condor. The differences between the two simulation models are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. GLGPU is based on a structured rectangular grid, using general-purpose graphics hardware. Currently, the spatial size of problem that can be modeled with GLGPU is limited by the amount of GPU memory; however, the total amount of the timevarying output data can be arbitrarily large. The output of GLGPU is </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">B = ∇ × A) ∇ Gradient operator in 3D, ∇ = ( ∂ ∂x , ∂ ∂y , ∂ ∂z ) T ∇ Gradient operator in 4D,∇ = ( ∂ ∂x , ∂ ∂y , ∂ ∂z , ∂ ∂t ) T E, F , C</formula><p>Sets of mesh edges, faces, and cells Lee, L ef , L ff Edge-edge, edge-face, and face-face links in mesh graphs F i p Set of punctured faces in time frame i E i,i+1 p Set of intersected edges between time frame i and i + 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Fp Set of F i p for all time frames E p Set of E i,i+1 p for all time frames V i = {V i k } Set of vortex graphs in time frame i V (k) = {V i (k) }</formula><p>Tracked vortex graphs with the global ID k over time</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">S i 0 ;i 1 = {S i 0 ;i 1 k }</formula><p>Set of vortex sheet graphs from time frame i0 to i1  custom-formatted binary files (BDAT). Condor is based on an unstructured mesh, using MPI-based parallelism in supercomputers. It is built on the libMesh <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> finite-element library, and tetrahedra are the basic mesh elements in the grid. The mesh as well as the Condor solution data is stored in the ExodusII 1 format. LibMesh provides a high-level API to load mesh and solutions into memory. The discretizations of the GLGPU and Condor grids are finite difference and finite element, respectively. In GLGPU data, values inside the mesh elements are estimated by trilinear interpolation. In Condor, piecewise linear approximation is used in the finite-element simulation.</p><p>In general, the numerical solution of TDGL models is the tuple (ψ, A), where ψ is the order parameter, and A is the magnetic vector potential. Both variables are used in our analysis. The tuple (ψ, A) is not a unique description of the state of the superconductor but rather one of an infinite set of tuples that constitute the gauge freedom of the solution. Any property of the data needs to be measured in a gauge-invariant way or calculated in a way that is not dependent on which specific tuple is used. For example, while the magnitude of ψ <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 3(a)</ref>) is gauge invariant, the phase of ψ <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 3(b)</ref>) is not. The two phase maps shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>(c) and 3(d) are equally legitimate. In order to calculate the phase change around a closed contour in a gauge-invariant manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, the calculation should be transformed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">L ∇θ • dl = L (∇θ − A) • dl + L A • dl,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where L is the integral path, θ is the phase angle of the order parameter ψ, and A is the magnetic vector potential. When L is a closed curve, the Stokes theorem allows the contour integral of A to be calculated as the flux of magnetic field B, that is, B • da. For the finiteelement-based Condor code, however, the magnetic flux is nontrivial to compute because there are multiple gradients of A on vertices and edges in the mesh element. Hence, the contour integral is calculated directly instead. While both codes currently assume a uniform magnetic field (B) in the domain, the value of magnetic vector potential (A) is provided in different ways. For the GLGPU code, the magnetic vector potential is analytically defined. For Condor, in contrast, A is stored as a value on each vertex in the data file. The latter is in anticipation of implementing nonuniform magnetic fields in the future.</p><p>System status and parameters such as voltage V and external current J ext are stored for each time frame. Also, simulation configurations need to be handled correctly in the visualization and analysis. (See <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for details.) In addition, the locations of material inclusions embedded in the field are also available if they are used in the simulations. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> shows the geometries of inclusions as transparent spheres.</p><p>For convenience, we define four types of mesh elements in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref> based on the dimensionality: cells, faces, edges, and vertices. Cells are basic units in the mesh that contain several vertices; they are tetrahedra or hexahedra in our data. Faces are sides of cells, and edges are sides of faces. In the data structures of the next section, edges and faces each are stored just once. Based on the ordering of vertices describing the element, each edge has an implicit direction, and each face has a winding direction determined by the right-hand rule. The vortex extraction algorithm locates the vortex lines at individual time frames, and the vortex tracking algorithm correlates these lines across time frames with consistent and unique IDs. Formally, each vortex line is an ordered locus of singularity points defined by Equation 1. The tracking results are essentially vortex surfaces that contain a locus of vortex lines at different times, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref>. In our graph-based algorithms, vortex lines and vortex surfaces are represented as vortex graphs and (vortex) sheet graphs, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">GRAPH-BASED VORTEX EXTRACTION AND TRACKING</head><p>The pipeline of the extraction and tracking algorithms is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. Both algorithms are based on the mesh discretization used in the simulations. The mesh is presumed to be fine enough to capture   all important physical phenomena of the TDGL model, and the simulation output is assumed to be continuous between grid points over space and time. A moving (or stationary) singularity is detected by examining mesh elements over time. Specifically, vortices are detected and tracked by examining spatial faces and space-time edges as follows. At a given time frame, vortices are located by checking each mesh face to see whether it is punctured by a vortex line. The movement of a vortex line is detected by checking each space-time edge to see whether it is intersected at an intermediate time between two adjacent time frames. The punctured (space) faces and intersected (space-time) edges are stored in F p and Ep, respectively, for further analysis. The key part of the pipeline is the construction of vortex graphs and sheet graphs, which are graph-based discretizations of vortex lines and vortex surfaces. A vortex graph V i k connects a subset of punctured faces F i p in time frame i. A set of punctured faces (usually two) are connected if they belong to the same mesh cell. This presumption is based on Lemma 1 (see the Appendix) that a closed volume (a cell in this case) in R 3 has an equal number of vortex entry and exit points. Based on this principle, vortex lines are generated by tracing the connected nodes in a vortex graph. A vortex sheet</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">S i 0 ,i 1 k connects all punctured faces ∪ i 1 i 0 F i p and intersected edges ∪ i 1 −1 i 0 E i,i+1</formula><p>p in time period i 0 to i1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 7(a)</ref>). Two elements are connected if they are in the same space-time prism, which is a space-time extension of a spatial face f . A connection indicates that a vortex line has intersected the face f over the time interval by moving in, out, or through, or staying inside the face <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 7(b)</ref>). Events can be further detected based on the extraction results.</p><p>Our analysis is based on the mesh graph G in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8</ref>, whose nodes include all edges and faces in the mesh and whose links are their connections. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> The following subsections present detailed descriptions of  the construction of a mesh graph, detection of punctured faces and intersected edges, and the construction of a vortex graphs and vortex sheet graphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Mesh graph construction</head><p>A mesh graph is the basic data structure in our graph-based vortex extraction and tracking algorithms. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8</ref> illustrates an example of the mesh graph for a tetrahedral mesh consisting of two tetrahedra. Formally, a mesh graph is the undirected and edge-weighted graph G = (N , L ). The set of nodes N = {E, F} is the set of all mesh edges E and mesh faces F . The set of links L = {L ee, L ef , L ff } is the set of all edge-edge links L ee, edge-face links L ef , and faceface links L ff . Two edges are linked if they belong to the same face; an edge is linked to a face if the edge belongs to face, and two faces are linked if they belong to the same cell. Edges and faces each are stored with an implicit direction. Each link in L has a weight of +1 or −1 indicating directional agreement or disagreement between two connected elements. Directional agreement between faces, for example, means their winding directions both point in or out of the cell. For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8</ref>, the link between edge e 1 and face f1 has the weight of +1, but the link between edge e 7 and face f6 has the weight of −1.</p><p>The mesh graph G is stored as adjacency lists. Each edge keeps lists of sibling edge ids and parent face ids. Their directional agreements are stored in sibling edge agreement and parent face agreement, respectively. Similarly, each face keeps lists of child edge ids, child edge agreement, sibling face ids, and sibling face agreement.</p><p>The explicit construction of the mesh graph is necessary only for unstructured meshes. For structured Cartesian meshes, the regular pattern of the mesh makes these data structures implicit and trivial to generate on the fly. For unstructured meshes, however, finite-element libraries such as libMesh provide explicit access only to cells. If iterating over all cells, faces and edges will be repeatedly accessed, leading to an inefficient use of computation resources. Therefore, we first preprocess the mesh and construct the mesh graph. In this way, the parent, child, and sibling mesh element relationships are established once and reused.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Punctured faces and intersected space-time edges detection</head><p>The calculation of closed contour integrals can locate the singularities in the complex field defined over space and time. We use the paths around mesh faces and space-time edges as contours to detect singularities. If and only if a face is intersected by a vortex line in a single time frame, the edges of the face encircle a singularity. Similarly, if and only if a vortex line intersects an edge at an intermediate time between two time frames, a time contour can be constructed that also encircles a singularity. The time contour comprises the edge in space at the two time frames and two edges in time created by extending the end points of the space edge through time. An approximate intersection point or intersection time can be further solved by using interpolation.

Thus the meaning of a node and link in our graph is different from that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The pseudocode of vortex graph construction is listed in Algorithm 1 (left), and the algorithm is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. The connected components are extracted by either breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS). The time complexity for the search is O(|F i p | + |L ff |). The rationale for the vortex line construction is based on Lemma 1 and Lemma 2. For any cell in the mesh, which is a closed volume in R 3 , there must be equal numbers of entry and exit points if it is punctured by a vortex line. Our simulation models contain at most one puncture point per face. The likelihood that a puncture point falls exactly on an edge is negligible. Thus, there are always equal numbers of faces of a cell whose outward normals have a positive or negative dot product relative to the chiral direction of the vortex. In most cases, our data has no more than two punctured faces with opposite dot products in a punctured cell, thus ensuring that the two puncture Algorithm 2 Find adjacent nodes in a vortex sheet graph. </p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Fp = {F 0 p , F 1 p , . . . , F n−1 p }, Ep = {E 0,1 p , E 1,2 p , E n−2,n−1 p } function ADJ S (Fp, Ep, G , v)) A ← ∅ if v ∈ Ep then e ′i,i+1 ← v ⊲ v</formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">(f ′i ) do if f ∈ F i−1 p then A.add(f i−1 ) ⊲ Case IV eg. f 2 3 → f 1 3 else if f ∈ F i p then A.add(f i ) ⊲ Case V eg. f 2 3 → f 2 4 else if f ∈ F i+1 p then A.add(f i+1 ) ⊲ Case IV eg. f 2 3 → f 3 2</formula><p>end if end for end if return A end function points belong to the same vortex line. In rare cases (40 out of 9.7 million cells in Unstable BX dataset for all frames), a cell has multiple pairs of single-punctured faces <ref type="figure">(Fig. 10</ref>). Physically this corresponds to two vortices in close proximity, but we cannot distinguish the two vortices from the data. We treat them with the same vortex graph in the algorithm instead.</p><p>Vortex lines are constructed by connecting the puncture points, or nodes, in the graph. The order of traced nodes follows the chiral direction of the vortex, following links that connect "ins" (negative dot products) to "outs" (positive dot products). When a cell has more than two puncture points, the traced path from a node can have more than one link to follow. We break the vortex line into multiple lines at this node, but we group all the lines associated with the multiple puncture points of the cell as belonging to the same vortex ID.</p></div>

The basic idea is to partition the elements in F p and E p into a set of connected components and label them with different IDs for further processing. We do so by finding each connected component in the graph S i 0 ;i 1 by BFS. The time complexity of vortex sheet construction is O</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">( i 1 i 0 |F i p | + i 1 −1 i 0 |E i,i+1 p |)</formula><p>. The correctness of the vortex sheet construction algorithm is founded on Lemma 3 and Lemma 4. Similar to a volume in R 3 , a space-time volume in R 2 × R will also have two punctured "faces." The faces in the prism can be faces in the two time frames, or the "virtual faces," that is, space-time edges. A 2nπ phase jump in a virtual face means that the vortex line intersected the edge at an intermediate time between two time frames.</p><p>Detecting punctured faces and intersected edges results in five types of links in our graph model, corresponding to the five cases in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7(b)</ref>. If an intersected edge e i,i+1 has a link to another edge in E i,i+1 p , then a vortex line passes through the parent face of the both edges without intersecting the face in either time frame (Case I). If an intersected edge e i,i+1 connects to a punctured face, then the intersection of the vortex line has moved in or out of the face (Cases II and III). If a face f i links to the same face in adjacent time frames (f i−1 or f i+1 ), then the intersection of the vortex line remains inside this face (Case IV). Case V corresponds to the link between two faces in the same time frame. These links are identical to those generated by vortex extraction in Section 4.3 except that they are undirected. The construction of a vortex sheet generates a simple interpretation of the continuity of a vortex line across time frames.

If an event is none of the above five types, we call it a compound event. A compound event occurs if multiple splitting and merging events are in the same time interval. Technically, we cannot reconstruct the sequence of "subevents" in the compound event using the graph-based definition. Reconstructing the subevents requires a finer time discretization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">VISUALIZATION TOOL</head><p>A visualization tool is implemented for scientists to explore TDGL datasets. The tool has two design goals: to enable users to see how vortices are distributed in space and vary over time, and to investigate how vortex dynamics (events) and energy dissipation (voltages) are related. Hence, we designed the tool with two components (shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>): the spatial view and the event view. The former provides the interactive 3D visualization for vortices, and the latter visualizes the events and voltages in a 2D view. </p></div>

For the raw TDGL data, the order parameter magnitude can be visualized with volume rendering and isosurfaces, and the data slices can be rendered with pseudo colors. Vortices and their trajectories are visualized with tubes and surfaces, respectively. Arrows rendered on vortex lines indicate the chirality of the vorticies. Vortex surfaces are constructed by triangulating discrete points on vortex lines in adjacent frames. Together with the event diagram described in the next section, the spatial view can help scientists explore and discover key features in TDGL simulation data.</p></div>

Together with the line chart showing the voltages, the visualization provides an overview of vortex dynamics and their correlation with the energy dissipation. In the event view, each colored line represents a tracked vortex. The length of the line encodes the duration of the vortex. Short gray lines connect a group of vortices if they are involved in an event. Zooming allows users to browse details in a long time sequence. The graph layout is based on the dot algorithm in the Graphviz library <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Rendering is based on Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). The event graph G e = ({V i k }, Le) is transferred to dot and then transformed into a layout. Graphviz ensures the minimum numbers of crossings in the layout. Nodes in the same time frames are set to the same rank in dot input in order to align the nodes to time frames. To keep long vortices as straight as possible in the layout, we assign higher weights to their corresponding links in the graph. Color schemes are automatically generated in order to avoid ambiguities in both the graph and 3D visualizations according to two constraints: (1) vortices in the same time frame cannot have the same colors, and (2) vortices involved in the same event cannot have the same colors. The graph layout and the color schemes are transformed into the SVG format, which can be easily rendered in the event view.</p></div>

In the simulation, the external current increases over time; thus, the vortices are moving downward in an accelerating manner. The data has periodic boundary conditions in both the x and y direction. When a vortex crosses a periodic boundary, it reappears on the opposite side of the box. In each time frame, 65 vortices are detected, and no events occur over the time sequence. The rendering results and the supplementary video show that each vortex is consistently tracked over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">3D structured mesh data</head><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> and the supplementary videos, we visualize the vortex dynamics of a superconductor in a periodic dissipative state created by aligning the magnetic field and current in a superconductor with inclusions (dataset Unstable BX). From the event diagram and the voltage chart, we observe a strong correlation between the occurrence of events and the energy dissipation. The system oscillates between a slowly evolving, nearly stable state and a rapidly rearranging, unstable state.</p><p>Vortices are stretched in the direction of the magnetic field. Attracted to material inclusions, vortices bend to pin themselves on a nearby inclusion. If the vortices were perfectly straight in the xdirection, the external current applied along the x-axis would impose no force on them. The bending of the vortices induces a slight Lorentz force from the current, pushing the vortex along the y-axis. In frames 101 to 187, the bent part of each vortex slowly deforms in the ydirection (see vortex surfaces of #5, #6, #7, and #10 in frames 101 to 187). At frame 187, vortices #0 and #3 swap parts to create two new vortices #14 and #15 at frame 188. The motions before and after this event occur extremely fast, as shown by the vortex surfaces.</p><p>In addition to the 3D visualization of vortices, scientists would also like to see an overview of all events and investigate how these events are related to voltage changes. From the event diagram, we can see that the vortices rapidly topologically reconfigure after frame 230. At frame 231, vortex #15 bends to the boundary and splits into two new vortices #16 and #17, each attached to the boundary of the system. The two ends of the vortex attached to the boundary are now pushed helically around the system in opposite directions by the Lorentz force. The two vortex ends travel along a cross-section of the system where several inclusions are roughly aligned in the y-direction, and a series of recombination events along this plane is observed in subsequent frames. The two vortex ends meet and join again, and the system relaxes back into a quiescent state after frame 330. The line chart below the event diagram depicts the voltage spikes observed over the cycle. The intense voltage spike occurs when the ends of the vortex attach to the slab surface and are driven helically around the system.</p></div>

After the event, the lower and upper parts of vortex #39 become the lower and upper parts of #43 and #44, respectively, and the upper and lower parts of vortex #40 become the upper and lower parts of #43 and #44, respectively. The vortex surfaces on the left and right side show how vortices deform before and after recombination.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">DISCUSSION</head><p>Vortex extraction and tracking algorithms enable scientific exploration and analysis of superconductor simulation data. Extraction of a vortex allows precise interpretation of a vortex's spatial features, regardless of its proximity to another vortex or an inclusion. Tracking allows each vortex to be identified over time and shows events that change the topology of a vortex. Event diagrams provide a visual abstraction of the events and facilitate interactive exploration. By visualizing the events of the tracking algorithm, the user is provided a quick overview of the entire time sequence. This allows subsequent investigation into the relationship between vortex dynamics and macroscale measures such as energy dissipation. Vortex tracking also enables precise characterization and measurement of local vortex motions.</p><p>For a closed volume in R 3 (cells in our algorithms), if there are one entrance point and one exit point, the two points belong to the same vortex line unambiguously. Similarly, we observe how singularity points move over time by calculating phase jumps over spacetime edges. Vortex graphs and vortex sheet graphs are constructed by graph-based algorithms, and vortices are tracked over time and labeled with global IDs. Events are detected if vortex lines have topological changes over time.</p><p>In general, the robustness of the algorithms is limited only by the resolution of the data. A space or time discretization that is too coarse can generate various artifacts, and scientists would need to rerun the simulation with finer discretization of the mesh in such cases. Since phase changes can be correctly measured only if their magnitude is less than π, if the mesh is too coarse, false positives or false negatives in the punctured face and intersected edge detection will result. We also require that no more than one vortex puncture each face. However, if more than one vortex or vortex sheet punctures the same cell by different faces <ref type="figure">(Fig. 10)</ref>, we can handle the case by treating the vortices as a compound object. Similarly, in event detection, if multiple events occur involving the same set of vortices over a time increment, we cannot reconstruct the subevents that create the compound event; but we can identify the presence of a compound event. All the issues can be resolved by increasing the data resolution. A puncture point exactly intersecting a spatial edge of the mesh in a time frame, resulting in zero, two, or three punctured faces instead of one, is a highly unlikely occurrence that we have never observed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper, we have presented a framework for vortex extraction and tracking of both structured and unstructured complex-valued TDGL simulation data. By checking singularities on mesh faces and spacetime edges, we have shown how to construct vortex graphs and vortex sheet graphs that model the connectivities of singularity points in both space and time at the finest scale the dataset supports. By applying various visualization techniques, we have demonstrated how we can explore the analysis results and help scientists understand vortex dynamics and macroscale superconductor behaviors. Future work will entail supporting in situ analysis and improving performance by exploiting the inherent parallelism in our algorithm. Because both the Condor simulation and our code use the same libMesh library, our framework can be integrated into TDGL simulations for in situ analysis. Currently, the most time-consuming part of the pipeline is detecting the punctured faces and intersected edges. However, this part of the algorithm should parallelize easily. Additionally, the vortex extraction and tracking framework may be extended to more complicated meshes, for example, adaptive mesh refinement. In event visualization, challenges remain to effectively visualize complicated events for very long time sequences, which could be addressed by new visual analysis technologies.</p><p>The framework developed here is applicable to any scientific application investigating topological defects in complex scalar fields discretized over time and space. For example, the proposed methods could be used for analyzing other complex-valued Ginzburg-Landau simulations such as superfluidity, Bose-Einstein condensation, strings in field theory, topological defects in liquid crystals, and complicated nonlinear fluid dynamics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A PROPERTIES OF VORTEX SETS AND DETECTION LEMMAS</head><p>In this appendix we discuss several fundamental properties of the vortex sets of solutions ψ of Ginzburg-Landau equations (GL) on a smooth compact domain D ⊂ R 3 . These properties follow from the behavior of the complex parameter ψ that can be derived from the general theory of GL equations but whose proof is outside the scope of this discussion. In particular, we assume that ψ is sufficiently smooth as a simultaneous function of space and time and that for a nontrivial magnetic field at any given time ψ vanishes at most on subsets of D of topological dimension 1, roughly speaking, on curves. By definition vortices are precisely the branch curves for θ, where θ = Arg(ψ), and the relevant techniques for reasoning about vortices are analogous to analytic continuation of functions of complex variable. In particular, the phase is single valued on any simply connected domain outside the vortex set but multi-valued on any domain that links 3 a subset of the branch points of θ. This multivaluedness is equivalent to a nontrivial increment of the phase along a closed contour γ linking the branch point set: ∆θ = γ ∇θ • dx. These phase integrals are topological invariants: their value does not change as long the underlying contour is deformed without changing its linking relationship with the vortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Set A links set B if closed contours are lying in A that cannot be deformed to a point without cutting B.</p><p>(i.e., branching) set. We summarize these properties as the following lemma: Lemma 1. Singularities (vortices) of the order parameter ψ are the branching curves of its phase θ = Arg(ψ). These curves either are closed or terminate on the boundary of D.</p><p>Because vortices are extended lines that do not terminate in the interior of D, they must "puncture" any generic (i.e., up to an arbitrarily small perturbation of the mesh), smooth compact surface an even number of times: if the line "enters," it must "exit" the surface. That is, if we assume that a compact smooth surface S bounding an open set intersects the vortex line transversely (i.e., not tangentially) away from a branch point, we can state the following vortex conservation law, where the puncture points are signed by the chirality (direction) of the vortex curve: Lemma 2. The sum of signed puncture points on a generic S is zero.</p><p>Because ψ is sufficiently smooth as a function of both space and time, the space-time branching curve C ⊂ R 2 × R in 3D space-time is precisely the set of spatial branch points parameterized by time. That is, each time slice C ∩R 2 ×{t0} is the set of branch points of ψ at time t 0. Similarly, the space-time branch surface S ⊂ R 3 × R in 4D spacetime is composed exactly of the spatial branch curves at different times. It immediately follows that the values of phase integrals along contours in space-time do not depend on the contour orientationwhether the contour is confined to a fixed time-slice t = t 0 (horizontal) or crosses time slices (has a vertical component); the integral value depends only on the contour's linking relationship with the branch set. Therefore, we have the following lemmas.  An illustration of how a moving vortex leads to Lemmas 3 and 4 as well as a longer discussion of the behavior of phase integrals and branch sets is provided in the supplemental material.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>(a) Isosurface and (b) volume rendering of the order parameter magnitude |ψ|.
