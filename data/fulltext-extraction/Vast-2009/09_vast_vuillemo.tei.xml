				<p>A common task in literary analysis is to study characters in a novel or collection. Automatic entity extraction, text analysis and effective user interfaces facilitate character analysis. Using our interface, called POSvis, the scholar uses word clouds and selforganizing graphs to review vocabulary, to filter by part of speech, and to explore the network of characters located near characters under review. Further, visualizations show word usages within an analysis window (i.e. a book chapter), which can be compared with a reference window (i.e. the whole book).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The development of digital libraries now gives scholars access to large bodies of literature. MONK www.monkproject.org is an example of a digital environment designed to help humanities scholars discover and analyze patterns in the texts they study. It aims to support both micro analyses of the verbal texture of an individual text and macro analyses that let you locate and analyze texts in the context of a large document space consisting of hundreds or thousands of other texts. These explorations allow scholars to practice forms of what Franco Moretti has provocatively called "distant reading" <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Getting salience out of data and formulating new hypotheses for making further explorations are among the many goals of visual analytics tools. While humans are good at quickly identifying shapes from diagrams or faces in images, it is very difficult to get an overview of a text collection at a glance, much less make comparisons. For example the sentence "Peter is greater than John, and both are smaller than Adam" takes more time for humans to understand than a simple picture depicting the same height relationships.</p><p>A common task for literary scholars is to study characters in a book or collection. They may try to characterize the relationship between family members in a novel, or study the evolution of the mentions of an historical figure in a collection of biographies. Text analysis and effective user interfaces might facilitate the exploration of the topics discussed or the vocabulary used in the neighborhood of the characters. Using our interface, called POSvis, scholars may use word clouds and self-organizing graphs to review the vocabulary in the vicinity of one or more entities, filter by part of speech, explore the network of other characters in that vicinity, and compare different text segments.</p><p>Before going further we define some of the terms we use in the paper. The term name entity is used loosely to refer to names that can be extracted automatically (typically proper names). The part of speech classification is a grammar classification of words, based on eight categories: verb, noun, pronoun, adjective, adverb, preposition, conjunction, and interjection. We say that words or name entities co-occur if they both appear at least once within a fixed text window, typically set by the user (e.g. a 20 word window, or a paragraph). The document structure is a hierarchy based on document abstraction levels found in the documents (e.g. using XML tags). For a book it could be: book &gt; chapter &gt; section &gt; paragraph etc.; these are used to choose regions to be compared.</p><p>We start by describing the problem that motivated our work, then describe POSvis' interface, the query workflow, and finally, results exploration. In section 4, we describe POSvis architecture and text analysis techniques. Finally in section 5 we describe our early study case results; these are discussed in section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">MOTIVATION</head><p>We worked with <ref type="table">Tanya</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The task addressed in this paper is an attempt to understand how the identity and relationships of family members changed over time by examining the words that cooccur with these characters. Because of the chaotic structure of the text, even an expert reader, may become lost or confused. Manually keeping track of name entities and their relationships is also difficult (we found 190 entities in the book).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERFACE</head><p>POSvis [14] follows Shneiderman's Information Visualization mantra of "overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand". <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the graphical interface, using The Making of Americans text collection loaded. The Document Overview panel (top strip) represents an overview of the document's structure. The X-axis shows chapters. The Y-axis is proportional to the number of words in the sections. Filter controls are two range sliders, A (analysis text, in red ) and B (reference text, in black ), that permit to set the document scopes for comparisons. The Query panel located on the left side of the screen shows in a first list extracted entities with their occurrence count in the analysis section. Entities can be sorted by alphabetical or cumulative count order, to get a quick access to respectively a specific or most/less frequent item. Entities can be selected or unselected and can be (or not) appended to each other, and appear in a second list. The third list gives Part of Speech (POS) categories with cumulative occurrences counts for each category. Embedded checkboxes in strips permit multiple POS selections. At the bottom of the panel, two buttons: one for saving the query for further usage, and another one for resetting the query to start with default values.</p><p>By default the Results panel shows a word cloud using usage frequency information (size) and POS information (color). An export feature enables data resulting from the query to be as raw data (XML) or as a picture (PNG) to be included in presentations or blogs.</p><p>A Control panel (as a tab behind the Query panel) allows users to adjust parameters of the result display e.g. the frequency threshold for a word to be displayed in the tag cloud. Font selection, minimum and maximum font sizes and graph layout options are also available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.1</head><p>Query specification First users select an analysis section (and optionally a reference section) in the Overview panel. Users then set the size of the text window -or the range of area around a chosen entity-to be used to determine co-occurrences, e.g., 20 words before and after, or a paragraph. The selection of name entities is iterative, using items such as checkboxes and dynamically updated menus. There is no submitting query button: every click or focus results in an action, allowing non expert users to perform complex queries that would have required advanced knowledge of Structured Query Language (SQL). Results are progressively revealed in the results panels. When users select items, details appear in the context panel and we emphasize focused entities / POS by respectively highlighting them in blue or in yellow . This bi-color code is used again The top strip shows a document structure overview (here chapters) which allow users to select regions for analysis (red slider) and reference (black slider). In the query panel on the left, users can set the size of the vicinity window (here a paragraph) used for determining co-occurrence. In the control panel (tab not visible on the screenshot), entities were defined as NNP and NNPS (singular and plural proper names). One entity (Martha) was selected in the list of name entities, and verb and nouns were selected in the Part of Speech (POS) menu. Words found in the vicinity of Martha are summarized in a word cloud in the middle, and details on-demand are available on the right panel.</p><p>in further selections/focus for visualizing selected items in lists, tag clouds or results in context. Another color coding is introduced for the POS categories: verbs , nouns , pronouns , adjectives , adverbs , prepositions , conjunctions , interjections . The properties tab allows users to change these colors and to add or remove POS categories (e.g. to distinguish plural from singular nouns).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.2</head><p>Word usage in vicinity of name entities Results are presented in two tabbed panels showing either a word cloud or a social network of name entities. If the character Martha is selected, the results display will show where it frequently appears and a summary of neighboring words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.2.1</head><p>Word clouds by Part of Speech Word clouds are a simple way to summarize content; it is widely appreciated by literary scholars who find it easy to use <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and enjoy the often elegant resulting displays. The result can be displayed as a word cloud comprising the words found in the vicinity of the selected entities, and filtered to only show the entities that match the POS selected in the query panel. To increase the salience of the word cloud we give users the ability to define their own mapping with the controls at the bottom of the word clouds. Three independent visual variables are available: word order, size and color. They can encode text variables such as order of appearance in selection (analysis or reference) and cumulative count of occurrence in analysis or reference selection. Other customizations to increase salience such as count thresholds or color assignments are possible using the properties panel on the left. Some POS can be excluded/included in the query panel, but specific entities can also be included or excluded by category or as individual entities. This is useful as some words may predominate and overwhelm the visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.2.2</head><p>Dunning log-likelihood Word clouds To compare two text regions we used a Dunning's log-likelihood analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to highlight words that are underused or overused in the analysis region, compared to a reference region.  A single tag cloud can encode words issued from many categories, but a single cloud limits our ability to make comparisons within each category. For that purpose we introduced a mosaic word cloud that shows 3x3 small word clouds <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3</ref>) encoding the different categories. All the tag clouds share the same color, size and order encoding type. But we kept range values (for color or heights) encoding particular to the category in each cloud. For instance, a words height reflects frequency within a POS category and not in the overall text. The multiple views are tightly coupled. For instance, if a word is selected on the tag cloud, lists on the left are automatically updated to reflect available choices (and users get quantitative frequency values). We lessen the ambiguous nature of each word by showing a context view on the right panel with quotes from the text where the word appears. In addition, when a user clicks on the quotes the full text is displayed in the document content tab, i.e. hiding the word cloud. Users can also explore results sequentially by keying down/up. Coordinating these tasks helps users explore each result without missing any entry.</p><p>Multiple encoding allows to quickly getting what are the most salient words, and interactions can be possible by varying reference or analysis selections. Beneath lists selection are mandatory captions that communicate what is encoded with what <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. A second entity (Eddy) has been selected (either with the left checkbox or by double clicking on the name in the network panel) and is getting closer to Martha since they are both sharing name entities. We also selected new POS sub-categories as entities (left Control panel).Color coding is by POS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.2.3</head><p>Co-occurrence entities graph Illustrating networked data structures illustrates interactions among multiple items well, but two main issues remain: how to construct the graph and how to render it so that it is interactive. In POSvis, two entities are connected in the graph if they both cooccur within the same region).</p><p>Self organizing networks permit an efficient use of the screen space because they stabilize quickly. Contrary to other graph drawing or morphing techniques, our focus was on real time force-directed layout computations with dynamic updates. Users can filter the network with strict co-occurrence by showing entities that are connected to other entities that also appear. Much like word clouds, network visual attributes (entities/links color and size) reflect data attributes. The network holds the same coordination features as the tag cloud. An extra feature allows users to double-click on names, which are then automatically added/removed from the query; this action allows users to perform direct querying ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">ARCHITECTURE</head><p>Our major concerns during the architecture design were to keep the interface very reactive and the client program as light as possible.</p><p>The user interface follows a classic model-view-controller architecture, which is dispatched into a user client (that displays views and holds the controller) and a remote server (where the model is hosted and views are generated).</p><p>The user client interface is a Java application. We used Prefuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for interactive graph layout functions, internal data structures (tables) and the interaction widget. Otherwise we used Swing components, which are robust enough to allow users to formulate their needs. The server becomes more complex, since we need to generate views from the model. We need 1) to build an index of the texts and answer queries using that index, 2) rank according to criteria (counts, relevance) and 3) integrate multi data sources. For that purpose we used Apache Lucene server (http://lucene.apache.org/), a high-performance, full-featured text search engine library written entirely in Java. The system execution process is threefold <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2)</ref>. First text collections are pre-processed (e.g. tagged) offline using a text analysis mashups on a server based on the Software Environment for the Advancement of Scholarly Research (SEASR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and indexed by Lucene. The goal of the SEASR project is to create a flexible and scalable architecture that can be quickly deployed and reused for the humanities. This way, additional text processing such as cleaning up stop words or porter stemming can easily be included in the data flow, even by a scholar using the SEASR interface drag and drop intuitive interface. Then, while users construct their queries, views are created in a cache MySQL database based on word attributes. Word clouds are generated from the MySQL database by a visualization server, available as a RESTful Web Service published over HTTP (without proxy restriction). This way, word clouds can be seen as resources to which we pass parameters for options and results are in XML-like file format. Resulting XML files have a unique URL which can be visualized in any web-browser and easily shared or plugged into another system. Finally, the URL is imported by the Java application and is coupled with a local custom CSS file, according to users color mappings. The social network results from a query to Lucene index, and filled into edges and links tables. If users want details on data, such as the original text, queries are performed directly to to the Lucene which very quickly retrieve the document and highlight results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.1</head><p>Discussion on architecture design Interface reactivity is crucial since we want users to iteratively perform queries -make them and remake them-and visualize results. The main bottleneck appears when an entity is added to the query: then the system has to generate new views on the dataset. These views are virtual tables that require time to be created but are very quick to interrogate. A view's lifetime is a user session long, and then it is deleted. Saving or pre-generating these views as cache is a viable optimization, but the trade off is that it needs lots of disk space. As a short term solution, batch processes can be triggered after user queries; users are then advised of the estimated time remaining to complete their tasks, and they get a dialog window notification when the job is done and the interface is ready to use.</p><p>Note that index creation would be the natural way to make queries quicker, by using columns in database such as chapter or paragraph. But with the varying windows (n words before, m words after) index creation is not possible (or it would require indexing all possible windows which results in a combinatory explosion). Another further optimization is outsourcing independent time-consuming computations to clouds or distributed databases, but this requires making processes independent, launching them and finally gathering results, adding complex merging and checking constraints without being able to predict the response time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5</head><p>PILOT CASE STUDY  <ref type="figure">(Figure 6</ref>), in the role of a pronoun or an adjective and in the subject or object position. Ultimately, word frequency information was not useful in determining the word's behavior. Clement proposed that the high frequency of one was the result of the confusion accomplished by the word's schizophrenic nature. While POSvis was originally intended to be used with proper names, it was quickly extended to allow users to analyze entities which are not proper names. By using POSvis, the progression of the manner in which the word one was used in terms of different parts of speech was documented, allowing Clement to see that the use of one appears to change as the text progresses. The analysis led to a reading in which one represents a singular subject position and multiple subject positions at once. With this information, an argument could be made that the discourse about identity formation in The Making of Americans is engaged in this multiplicity, not dissolved in indeterminacy, which let to a publication ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and inclusion in a PhD thesis).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>The literary scholars who provided feedback on the prototype could readily find potential use scenarios in their own work. Nevertheless their examples made it clear that character names are rarely going to be as easy as finding "Victor Hugo" in historical texts. While the problem of missed references was found acceptable (e.g. when a pronoun is used instead of the proper name), scholars asked to be allowed to add specific name entities (e.g. the "little prince" or "fox" when analyzing Saint Exup√©ry's story), or nouns such as "mother" when the reference is unambiguous. Multiple named entities may need to be grouped into a single one (e.g. "Mother" and "Martha") or all the names of family members could be aggregated into a single family entity or a high order concept. Today the current POSvis implementation only allows the comparison of text regions using the document structure to select regions (e.g. comparing one chapter to another). A logical next step is to allow scholars to find entities and compare larger sets of <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. The word one plays many positions in the text, in the role of a pronoun or an adjective and in the subject or object position.</p><p>texts. For example, scholars may want to compare the vocabulary in the vicinity of "Victor Hugo" in texts written in different centuries or by male or female authors. The easy manipulation of such collections is part of the tools being developed by the MONK project and the design of POSvis is designed to be integrated into MONK.</p><p>In the interface, the color coding of the parts of speech is problematic because of the large number of colors needed. Giving users control of the choice of color is helpful, but it might be necessary to allow them to group POS categories to limit the number of colors. While experimenting with the graph visualization, we found that being able to freeze the layout was important for avoiding constant movement and for allowing users to focus on changes in highlighting and linking.</p><p>Providing multiple word statistics and word cloud layout to compare texts may be needed since using Dunnings log likelihood ratio is familiar to many of the literary scholars we worked with but not all of them. For example, when comparing two text collections with Dunnings, only words that appear in both analysis and reference can be compared. In contrast, other displays use plain word counts and duplicate the words (e.g. Many Eyes in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref>), first putting words in A, then in A&amp;B, and finally in B. In these clouds, there is a substantial amount of wasted space so fewer words can be shown overall. Consequently, tag clouds have been shown to be problematic and rarely more effective than plain lists <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>. However, they are greatly appreciated by humanities scholars who love the intuitive picture they give of the text. Future case studies need to explore the best design with this user population. From a broader perspective, coming challenges on large textual data sets analysis can be summarized as Martin Wattenberg did in a Wired article <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> : "The entire literary canon may be smaller than what comes out of particle accelerators or models of the human brain, but the meaning coded into words can't be measured in bytes. It's deeply compressed. Twelve words from Voltaire can hold a lifetime of experience."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">RELATED WORK</head><p>Tagclouds are one way to get a spatial, birds-eye view of keywords from a text document. Looking at a tagclouds gives an impression of the type of content. Their construction is based on filtering large amounts of text using salience and interaction to find a better mapping with text abstraction attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>. Tagclouds are scattered all over the web thanks to their easy construction and comprehensibility, but their use tends to decline since there have not been many design improvements. Tagclouds have well-known limits, such as poor interaction support and the loss of contextual information. Authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> make a strong critique against tagclouds, complaining they are hard to compare and that the more letters they have the more they seem important. Another critique that is prevalent online is that most of the time captions are missing and it is not possible to determine what is encoded with what, such as if colors or word orders have meanings.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> authors studied the independent variables in tag clouds and ranked them from important (font size, font weight, intensity) to less important (number of pixels, tag width, tag area) to handle with care (color, position).</p><p>Wordle optimizes tagcloud layouts with aesthetics. The drawback with Wordle is that choosing layouts with vertical or reverse words --even biggest ones-has the effect of drawing less 1 http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_visualizing (Retrieved 03/2009) attention to these words because they are hard to read. Comparisons among tags become even more complex. An innovative way is to show relationships between tags with Dynamic TagClouds, 2 which is available as a Wordpress plug-in. Dynamic TagClouds is a Flash application that shows tags in a circle <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 7</ref>). If the user's mouse hovers over a tag, dashed links appear among the linked tags. Many Eyes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> platform provides visualizations of users' uploaded datasets and facilitates sharing among a community (example <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref>). It gives designers and dataset providers clues about the use of visualizations because they are easily included in blogs or any website. The major limitations are that interactivity is restricted to ranking or color coding attributes and the implementation makes visualizations (i.e. views on data) difficult to export for further analysis in other applications. Phrase Net, a recent visualization implemented in Many Eyes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 9</ref>), shows co-occurrences in uploaded texts. Thought Phrase Net gives a full overview of relationships within the dataset, it does not provide a filter-by-category feature and no information about the context of words. At the opposite, the Word Tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref> enables concordances, which show the context of word usage. The Word Tree offers a quick way for users to find word sequences and the words that surround them before and after. The limit here is that word occurrence is encoded by size only. Also, this method focuses on strict sequences of words, and does not work with fuzzy sequences where words occurrences may be in a slightly different order. Pixel based visualizations have been used to present "fingerprints" of the texts, to facilitate analysis and comparisons (e.g. for opinion analysis and document summarization) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The visualization of richly tagged collections has been shown to be useful to literary scholars in their analysis (e.g. Compus for historical research <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>. Jigsaw shows entities as lists. Entities can be selected, and then their relationships appear over multiple documents.</p><p>Finally Jigsaw <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref> is connecting multiple interactive visualizations (lists, scatter plot tag clouds, etc.) together in a complete visual analytic system environment. Tightly connected views assist analysts in document visualization and entities tracking. Entities can be displayed as lists <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 10</ref>), that can be reordered and be selected to better highlight and explore their relationships across multiple documents. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>. Jigsaw's document overview panel displays entities information (tag cloud on the top) from each document (list on the left) and the context in which they occur (middle panel).</p><p>Jigsaw's document overview panel ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11)</ref> shows occurring entities at a glance, and their frequency over the selected document. Also, a graph view is available to explore entities and documents, in a node-link way.</p></div>

As a result, she used Wordle to visualize Dunnings log-likelihood values for various 19 th Century novels in comparison to The Making of Americans, a novel written by Gertrude Stein in 1925. By browsing through these various Wordles of different novels and different sections of the text by Stein, Clement notice the prominence of the word one. Looking at simple word frequency lists revealed that the frequency of one surges by the end of the book, but after reading the text segments it became clear that the word one -unlike he, she, I, we, or even you or it-played many positions in the text</figDesc><table /><note>Before designing POSvis, our literary scholar partner had successfully used Wordle (http://www.wordle.net) to look at word frequencies in the different chapters.
