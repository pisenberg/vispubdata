			<abstract>
				<p>In this paper, we present a system for the interactive visualization and exploration of graphs with many weakly connected components. The visualization of large graphs has recently received much research attention. However, specific systems for visual analysis of graph data sets consisting of many components are rare. In our approach, we rely on graph clustering using an extensive set of topology descriptors. Specifically, we use the Self-Organizing-Map algorithm in conjunction with a user-adaptable combination of graph features for clustering of graphs. It offers insight into the overall structure of the data set. The clustering output is presented in a grid containing clusters of the connected components of the input graph. Interactive feature selection and task-tailored data views allow the exploration of the whole graph space. The system provides also tools for assessment and display of cluster quality. We demonstrate the usefulness of our system by application to a shareholder network analysis problem based on a large real-world data set. While so far our approach is applied to weighted directed graphs only, it can be used for various graph types.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Visual exploration of large graph data is helpful in many important application areas, such as biology, finance, transportation, etc. While the considered graph data often forms one large connected graph, in many cases a partitioning into multiple connected components (not connected to each other) is possible. For example, in an overall national shareholding network, each component represents one corporate holding subgraph. When analyzing the shareholding network of the whole economy, many components (further referred to also as (weakly) connected components) are present (e.g., in Germany ca 40,000). Then the exploration of the network with regard to distribution of components according to various criteria is needed. For example, Are there corporate holdings typical to the studied economy? Or are there differences in the shareholding relationships between different sectors in a given economy? Interactive visual exploration systems can help analyzing such networks.</p><p>The visualization of large graphs (with tens of thousands of nodes or more) has recently received much research attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19]</ref>, and results of it have been applied to visual analysis of large network data sets from different domains. However, only few specialized approaches are available for visual exploration of graphs with multiple components <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20]</ref>. They usually use packing algorithms for non-overlapping and space efficient layout of graph components. These approaches, however, disregard similarities between the components.</p><p>In this paper, we present a novel system for the interactive visualization and exploration of graphs with many connected components. Our approach follows Keim's visual analytics Matra "Analyse First -Show the Important -Zoom, Filter and Analyze Further -Details on Demand" <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. We use clustering of connected components for gaining overview of the prototype subgraphs in the network. The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm is used as it offers robust clustering and is well suited for visualization. The SOM cluster analysis is driven by a rich set of topology-based graph features, which can be interactively selected and combined by the user. Depending on the feature selection, different insights into the dataset can be produced. Our system offers exploration of the graph space by interactive visualization of the clustering results and clustering quality. Furthermore, it offers the possibility of saving and loading of clustering results using different clustering parameters and user-defined annotations of the process. It supports reproducibility of the analysis and insights gained.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews related work on visualization of large graphs with focus on graphs with many connected components. In Section 3, we introduce the overall architecture of the proposed visual graph analysis system. Section 4 recalls the SOM clustering procedure, and introduces our set of graph features we use for clustering. Section 5 describes the main visualization and interaction concepts for exploration of the disconnected graph space. Section 6 discusses an application of the technique to German shareholding network data. Finally, Section 7 concludes and discusses options for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>The visualization of large graphs is one of the main research areas in information visualization. In this section, we introduce some of the layout algorithms for large graphs and then concentrate on visualization of graphs with multiple components. Approaches applying SOM in connection with graph visualization are also discussed.</p><p>In the following we recall several layout algorithms, however our goal is not to elaborate on the wide variety of approaches. A general overview of graph visualization techniques can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. For visualization of large general graphs many different approaches have been used, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>. They often include the assessment of graph topology (by graph features) for a better layout of the graphs. Large graph visualizations often use data reduction techniques such as clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>, filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>, multi-scaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> or edge bundling <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25]</ref>.</p><p>The visualization of graphs with multiple components uses "packing", i.e., it lays out the components so that they do not overlap and are space efficient. For example, Dogrusoz <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> compares various two-dimensional packing algorithms for graphs which use the representation of graphs by their bounding rectangles. They include strip packing, tiling and alternate-bisection. The polyomino algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> of Freivalds et al. uses polyomino representation of the graph objects which substantially reduces the unused display space in comparison to rectangular shapes. Goehlsdorf et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>   placement which yields more compact layouts than the previously mentioned approaches. Grouping of components has been addressed by Cohen and Deschamps <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. They use minimal paths between components for finding complete curves from a set of edge points for image analysis.</p><p>The usage of self-organizing maps for graph drawing has been introduced by Meyer and Bonabeau. Meyer <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> described the so called ISOM layout, which is an extension of self organization strategies for drawing undirected graphs. Bonabeau applied SOM to laying out large graphs in 2D <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and to multi-dimensional scaling of large graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. However, all these approaches are primarily developed for visualizing connected graphs. Prieto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref> use SOM for the visualization of the evolution of a web-based social network. According to the authors, owing to the simple graph description using the graph adjacency matrix, their approach is constrained to graphs with a maximum of 500 edges. Their focus is the visualization of time-variation of the network. SOM-based clustering for graph matching has been used by Gunter and Bunke <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. They use edit-based graph distance for the recognition of handwriting. However, this approach has not been applied to general graphs and moreover, their work does not include visualization of clustering results. Neuhaus and Bunke <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> also uses SOM with graph edit cost for graph matching applying the approach to numerically labeled graphs.</p><p>In comparison to the approaches presented above, we offer a clustering of connected components according to their topologic properties and interactive exploration of the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">INTERACTIVE GRAPH CLUSTERING PROCESS</head><p>Clustering is an important data analysis technique. It supports the examination of large amounts of data by abstraction to a limited number of data prototypes describing groups of data and providing overview of the whole dataset. We apply clustering for visual analysis of graphs with multiple connected components. We use SOM clustering based on feature description of the components as presented below.</p><p>The clustering-based graph analysis process (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>) starts with partitioning the whole input graph into its weakly connected components. Each extracted component is described by a set of features creating a feature vector data set (cf. Section 4.2.1). The sum-mary table of the feature data set or the whole feature vector data set can be explored using various views (e.g., using multivariate visualization techniques such as parallel coordinates). The following feature selection step is supported by a user interface for interactive weight adjustment (cf. Section 4.2). The selected feature set is used as input for calculating similarity between components during clustering. After choosing the SOM clustering parameters, SOM clustering is performed (cf. Section 4.1). The clustering results are shown using interactive visualization techniques described in Section 5.1. The subsequent assessment of the clustering quality is supported by interactive exploration of the results as well as by calculation of the SOM quality measures and their detailed display (cf. Section 5.2). During the whole process, the system supports editing of user annotations in each analytic step. These annotations can be used to comment decisions on process parameters or intermediate analysis results obtained while working with the system. The results of the process (input and output data, annotations and parameters) are stored, supporting reproducibility and comparison of results. The feedback loop allows to change the parameters, switch between process stages and views and thereby create new results and insights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">GRAPH FEATURES AND GRAPH CLUSTERING</head><p>In this section our approach to clustering of graphs with large amounts of weakly connected components is presented. Each component is described by a set of features which are used to determine the similarity between graphs. We employ the well-known Self-Organizing-Map algorithm as the clustering technique of choice. The SOM method is described in Section 4.1, while features used are introduced in Section 4.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Clustering Approaches and Self-Organizing Maps</head><p>To date, many clustering techniques relying, e.g., on centroid or medoid-based approaches, hierarchical or density-based models, have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30]</ref>. While they differ in the way the clusters are obtained, most algorithms rely on an implementation of a similarity function defined over the set of data elements which are to be clustered.</p><p>Similarity based on Transformation, such as the Edit-2 Distance for undirected acyclic graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>, calculate the distance between graphs as the sum of costs when efficiently transforming one graph into the other. Feature-based approaches, such as the graph histogram <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>, capture important data attributes in form of a vector or histogram. Consequently, distances between data elements are calculated using vector-space or histogram distance functions. In this paper, we employ the feature-based vector technique.</p><p>The Self-Organizing Map algorithm (SOM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> is a neural network learning algorithm with a strong disposition for visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>. A network of prototype vectors is iteratively trained to represent a set of input data vectors. The network is often assumed to be a 2-dimensional regular grid. During training, the algorithm iterates over the input data vectors. For each input vector, it finds the best matching prototype, and adjusts it as well as a number of its network neighbors toward the input vector.In the course of the process, the considered neighborhood size and the strength of the adjustment process (learning rate) are reduced. The training results in a set of prototype vectors (or clusters) representing the input data. In addition, the low-dimensional arrangement of prototypes on the network yields a topological ordering of the prototype vectors, approximating the topology of data samples in original data space.</p><p>SOM analysis has previously successfully been applied to many different data types including text documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, audio <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>, and images <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In this work, we apply SOM cluster analysis based on feature vector descriptions of the graphs in our data set. In our current implementation, we use the SOMPAK <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> engine together with typical rule-of-thumb training parameter settings recommended for initial SOM clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. Specifically, we use a 8 * 6 rectangular SOM lattice with bubble neighborhood kernel. Other SOM lattice sizes and training parameters can be interactively user-specified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Graph Features</head><p>For SOM analysis, we describe each graph component by a set of appropriate graph properties (features). The selection of features, in general, depends on the type of network (directed vs. undirected, weighted vs. unweighted, with vs. without node labels, with vs. without node weights etc.) Moreover, further network specifics can influence selection of the set of graph features to use. For instance, the sum of all weights on incoming links in shareholder networks should always sum up to 100% and is therefore not informative. In contrast, the same measure in flow networks illustrates the flow strength through the nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Definition of Graph Features</head><p>Based on graph theory literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46]</ref> we chose a set of graph features referred to as important for weighted directed graphs. We categorized our supported features into general features, degree distribution features, distance features, reciprocity features, clustering features, and motif-based features. We briefly introduce each feature set in the following. For detailed definitions of features in each set, we refer to the above-mentioned literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">General features measure general properties of a network.</head><p>Examples include the order of a network (number of nodes), the degree of completeness (number of links relative to the number of possible links), and the average edge weight.</p><p>2. Reciprocity features in a directed network indicate whether node links are reciprocal, meaning that if there is a link from nodes A to B, then there exists also a link from nodes B to A. The set includes (weighted) reciprocity and the correlation coefficient of the adjacency matrix.</p><p>3. Distance features measure lengths of paths between nodes in a network, e.g., the diameter of a graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.</head><p>Clustering features measure the probability that two nodes that are neighbors to a third node, also share a link between each other. Different measures of clustering coefficients (weighted, in/out-clustering, etc.) can be used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.</head><p>Degree distribution features show the division of nodes according to their in/out-degree. The features include average/maximum relative node degree, relative number of loops, relative number of leaves, and relative number of roots. Additionally, degree correlation/assortativity can be used.</p><p>6. Motif-based features measure graph properties by the frequency of certain predefined substructures (motifs) occurring in the given graph. Analysis of many networks, such as biological or company networks, is assisted by examining the occurrence of certain motifs. In particular, in shareholder network analysis, these motifs allow to describe, e.g., companies with many subsidiaries (out-star motif), or "structures" leading to strengthening the voting power in a company via holding shares in third companies (feed-forward or caro motifs). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the set of considered motifs.</p><p>The introduced features do not cover all possible graph types and all graph domains and therefore could be extended according to the particular graph type and the use case. For example, for labeled networks, features describing label distribution can also be used, or in other cases, centrality features may be relevant as well. All the above-mentioned features have their strengths and weaknesses for different analysis domains. The particular set will be determined by the given analysis task and can be selected interactively (see the following section).</p><p>We note that the time complexity of the feature extraction typically depends on number of connected components, the size of each component, and the given type of feature. The calculation often can be accelerated by using parallel processing techniques. As the feature calculation could be done offline and only once for each graph and feature, also more expensive features can be considered, given the available resources. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Normalization and Selection of Features</head><p>The selection of features, their normalization and weighting influences the result of the SOM clustering. Depending on the type of  network, use case and user task at hand, an appropriate combination of graph features needs to be formed. We would not like to offer a predefined set of selected features (based on our experience), but offer the user the possibility to interactively select a suitable feature set for interactive exploration of the data set. We support interactive selection and weighting of features via the user interface depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. A set of sliders allows to set weights for each implemented feature. The sum of weights is normalized to 1.0 and changing of a weight of a feature influences the weights of the other features so that the sum stays constant. This allows to create variable user-preferred weighting schemes.</p><p>The user interface includes a heatmap visualization of the correlation matrix of the respective features, which helps in selecting features, e.g., the most orthogonal (uncorrelated) ones. The manual feature selection is assisted by simple tools that assess the feature relevance based on feature variance and correlations. It suggests the user to include or exclude the selected features from the set. The weights of features with zero variance are automatically preset to zero. The features that are highly correlated with many other features are proposed to be excluded from the analysis. More sophisticated semi-automatic feature selections (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>) will be included in the future.</p><p>All features are normalized in order to allow an easy proportional weighting. The normalization is based on graph theoretical aspects. Each feature score is calculated as a fraction of the actual value of the feature, relative to the theoretic maximum value. This yields a [0, 1]-normalization, which generally gives good results in the SOM clustering according to our observation. Note, another way would be to use the expected value of each feature in random graphs for feature normalization (instead of its maximum theoretic value).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATION</head><p>In this section, our approach for the interactive visualization of the results of SOM clustering is presented. The results are displayed in a SOM grid and interactive functions allow further exploration of the data space. The assessment of clustering quality is supported by interactive views and calculation of quality metrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Visualization of Clustering Results</head><p>The SOM algorithm, equipped with discriminative features, usually provides meaningful results, showing an effective overview of the types of graphs in the data space. The clustered results are visualized by showing one representative graph for each cluster on the SOM grid. The representative is chosen as the nearest neighbor sample graph to the respective SOM prototype vector. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure  4</ref> (center) illustrates a graph cluster map. The background color of each SOM grid cell indicates the relative size of the cluster, measured by the number of sample graphs matched, relative to the maximum number of samples at any SOM grid cell. For large SOM grids, the size of the grid cell can be very small which influences the readability of the displayed graphs. In this case, either the representative graph may be shown on demand in an extra view or hierarchic SOMs can be used.</p><p>In order to explore the members of individual clusters, the cluster elements are displayed on demand in a so-called member view. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> illustrates member views of several graph clusters, arranged around the cluster map. For clusters with a large number of members (hundreds, thousands), it is possible to visualize the distance distribution or feature distribution of the cluster (see next section) and explore parts of the clusters on demand. Large clusters can also be used as an input for subsequent clustering. This allows for refinement of the clustering results as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>.</p><p>The visualization of a connected component in the grid employs node-link diagrams with edge width corresponding to the edge weight and arrows showing the edge direction (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4)</ref>. As the development of a new layout algorithm was not in the focus of the work, standard layouts provided by the JUNG graph framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref> were included for visualization of the graphs. The choice of the applied layout is user dependent. It should however support an easy comparison of graphs in the SOM grid. In our case, Fruchterman-Rheingold layout works nicely however it cannot be generalized.</p><p>The visualization of clustering results is additionally supported by display of so-called component planes (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>). This view shows the distribution of the individual features in the resulting SOM matrix. It shows the values of each feature characterizing the cluster center across the SOM grid. The values are displayed as a heatmap. For example, the component plane for the graph size feature (top left), shows that bigger graphs are concentrated in the right up corner of the SOM grid and smaller in the left lower corner. On demand, the values of a selected feature are displayed as the background color of the SOM grid cells. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Visualization of Clustering Quality</head><p>In order to assess the quality of the clustering, several interactive views on the results are provided, supported by calculation and visualization of clustering quality measures. The distance distribution view shows the distribution of distances between cluster elements and the respective cluster center (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7)</ref>. In this view, we can see that the SOM clustering provides very good results, as most of the graphs assigned to a cluster are very close to the cluster center and only few outliers with larger distances appear. The outlier graphs are displayed in a member view, where the background color corresponds to the distance to the cluster center. For comparison, the cluster representative is shown as well (the top left graph). The display of feature distributions for the members of the cluster shows the range and frequency of graph features in a selected cluster. Together with the graph distance view (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7)</ref>, it allows to spot outliers in the clusters and assess the overall quality of the clustering. On demand, an overview of the cluster members across the feature distribution or parts of the histogram can be displayed for detailed analysis of the cluster (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref>). In addition to the previous views, the system provides the assessment of clustering quality by various measures. The currently used measures follow proposals from several surveys, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43]</ref>. The overview of the measure values together with the distribution of a selected measure across the SOM grid are displayed (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 9</ref> for an illustration). This allows for a quantitative assessment of the SOM quality and detailed inspection of the quality measure values across SOM cells.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">APPLICATION</head><p>We discuss an application of our system on German corporate shareholding network data. Section 6.1 introduces the used data set. Section 6.2 then demonstrates the effect of selecting different feature sets for clustering. Section 6.3 illustrates a corporate structure analysis scenario. Note that, in the following analysis, the chosen SOM grid size is 8 * 6 as it offers reasonable results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Shareholder Structure Data Set</head><p>Shareholding relationships between companies in an economic system can be regarded as a directed network with nodes representing companies, and weighted, directed edges representing the "holdsshares-in" relationship between corporations. We consider the Amadeus database <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, which contains financial and ownership data on German corporations. The shareholding relationships are provided as tables with lists of companies and private persons holding shares in a company and their amount. The shareholding graph extracted from the database contains more than 300,000 entities. The graph contains one very large connected component with more than 115,000 nodes (135,000 edges), one graph with more than 20,000 nodes and around 40,000 smaller weakly connected components with up to 110 nodes each. For the application, we concentrate only on the part of the data without the two largest components. These components form two separate clusters and can be analyzed using other specialized graph exploration techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Interactive Data Analysis</head><p>Graph visualization using SOM clustering can be applied to the analysis of structure types formed in an economic system. For the analysis of the data set, we rely on interactive feature selection while using a constant SOM grid size. Changing of feature sets in combination with SOM clustering leads to various views on the data set. These views show the distribution of types of components. It shows which components are frequent in the data set and which are exceptional under the given feature set. In the following paragraph, our findings from the shareholder data set.</p><p>The SOM grid (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4)</ref> shows that the shareholding components in Germany vary from simple 2 node graphs (bottom left corner) to more complex larger graphs (top right corner). The starshaped graphs are the most important corporate structures, having the highest frequency and occupying multiple cluster centers (with varying graph sizes). The member views allow detailed analysis of individual companies with similar structures. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10a</ref> shows a SOM produced using only the number of nodes as a graph descriptor as a first naive approach. From top-left to bottom-right, graphs of increasing size are arranged on the map. It already reveals what sizes of shareholder structures there are in the dataset. Subgraphs with up to 6 nodes are very frequent. Then, with a gap, larger graphs occur. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10b</ref> shows a map obtained by extending this feature by the graph completeness. In effect, the initial coarse SOM layout is refined by accommodating more differentiation regarding a notion of the graphs' complexity. The result shows that the larger the company structures are the more complex is the relationship within them. Small holdings consist mainly of many shareholders of one company and larger include more interwoven cross-holdings.</p><p>Finally, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10c</ref> shows the usefulness of the feature controlling for number of loops in the graph for extracting extraordinary examples of companies directly holding shares in themselves. This phenomena is unexpected. It can be either an outlier, a data quality problem or an interesting company structure which should be reflected in the subsequent detailed analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Sectoral Analysis of Corporate Structures</head><p>The presented approach can be used also for comparison of corporate structures among several geographic regions (e.g., USA, Germany, Italy etc.) or for comparison of industries, types of companies, etc. In this paper, we have analyzed the German industries. In the dataset, each company is categorized into industries according to the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (NACE). We have used the top level of the classification for the distribution of the company structures into 17 industry categories. In order to compare the types of companies across German industries, we have applied the SOM clustering and visualization to the sets of companies in each industry. The results for the three largest industries using the same set of features are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>. In general, the structural distribution, although having variable layout, is similar to the whole economic system (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4)</ref>. Especially, the star-shaped corporate structures appear to be the most frequent in all subsets. However, it can be seen that extended star-shaped structures occur only in manufacturing (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.  11a</ref>). These star-shaped structured are more complex and seem not to be captured in the other sectors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper, we described a novel approach for visual analysis of graphs with many components. The approach is based on an effective combination of adaptive graph clustering and rich visualinteractive facilities for data exploration. Interactive feature selection for flexible clustering with visual output, and assessment of clustering quality provide comprehensive visual cluster analysis for graph data. The reproducibility and comparability of cluster results is supported by storing analysis parameters and user annotations.</p><p>The analysis of large graphs with many connected components is essential in various application areas, e.g., finance, biology, etc. We have applied our system on a large data set of German corporate shareholding networks as an example. In the future we would like to apply our approach on other data sets.</p><p>In the future, we will extend the system for supporting comparison of results using also different clustering methods (e.g., k-means, hierarchic clustering). We plan to extend the standard SOM algorithm with a hierarchic version, to provide efficient clustering even in presence of very large data sets and include weighting of cluster sizes. We would like to introduce functionality for comparisons of various cluster results and enhance semi-automatic feature selection by using statistic approaches (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>). Our system should also be extended by features for other graph types, for example labeled graphs such as biologic reactions. The visualization can be enhanced by a specialized layout supporting comparison of graphs.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Architecture of our system for visual analysis of graphs with multiple components.
