			<abstract>
				<p>This paper demonstrates the promise of augmenting interactive multivariate representations with information from statistical processes in the domain of weather data analysis. Statistical regression, correlation analysis, and descriptive statistical calculations are integrated via graphical indicators into an enhanced parallel coordinates system, called the Multidimensional Data eXplorer (MDX). These statistical indicators, which highlight significant associations in the data, are complemented with interactive visual analysis capabilities. The resulting system allows a smooth, interactive, and highly visual workflow. The system&apos;s utility is demonstrated with an extensive hurricane climate study that was conducted by a hurricane expert. In the study, the expert used a new data set of environmental weather data, composed of 28 independent variables, to predict annual hurricane activity. MDX shows the Atlantic Meridional Mode increases the explained variance of hurricane seasonal activity by 7-15% and removes less significant variables used in earlier studies. The findings and feedback from the expert (1) validate the utility of the data set for hurricane prediction, and (2) indicate that the integration of statistical processes with interactive parallel coordinates, as implemented in MDX, addresses both deficiencies in traditional weather data analysis and exhibits some of the expected benefits of visual data analysis.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>For years, weather scientists have used statistical analysis to investigate associations between weather phenomena and environmental observations. In particular, they have often used statistical regression, descriptive statistics, and correlation measures to estimate the importance of a set of predictors for seasonal hurricane activity. The motivation is to be able to predict, as far in advance as possible, the number and intensity of hurricanes that are likely to occur during a given hurricane season.</p><p>Weather scientists have also often used basic data graphics such as scatterplots and histograms. However, the inability of basic data graphics to convey complicated data associations is well understood by the visualization community <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. Another limitation, which is directly addressed in the work reported here, is that visualizations have typically lacked a direct connection to statistical processes such as regression analysis. And yet, the authors have noted that for the environmental scientists that they work with-weather scientists, oceanographers, and physicists-a typical workflow involves performing statistical and graphical analysis simultaneously, where the statistical correlations suggest causal relationships, and the graphical analysis helps explain why the relationships exist.</p><p>These facts have motivated the work reported here. We have developed a system, called the Multidimensional Data eXplorer (MDX), that augments a parallel coordinates visualization with automated statistical processes. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, MDX combines parallel coordinates capabilities with advanced interaction techniques integrated with MATLAB-based regression analysis. While most of the visualization and interaction techniques in MDX have been previously reported, we do not believe that any other parallel coordinates system has provided the range of capabilities as MDX.</p><p>In addition, this paper reports an extensive case study, in which a hurricane expert studied the ability of a new environmental weather data set, the 28-variable Colorado State University (CSU) and Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) data set, to predict annual hurricane activity. The hurricane expert is Dr. Patrick Fitzpatrick; he has been a long-term collaborator in this work and is a co-author of this paper. Approximately half of this paper describes the capabilities of MDX, while the other half describes the case study. Therefore, the research reported here is structured to directly address one of the main calls of the NIH/NSF Visualization Challenges Report <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, which recommends that visualization researchers "collaborate closely with domain experts who have driving tasks in data-rich fields to produce tools and techniques that solve clear realworld needs." In this paper, the tool is MDX, the techniques are parallel coordinates and interaction methods integrated with statistical regression routines, and the real-world need is the prediction of annual hurricane activity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Using schemes similar to those described by Vitart <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, scientists have successfully employed statistical regression techniques using historical data to identify significant predictors for hurricane activity. Recently, Klotzbach et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> used regression techniques to identify the most important variables for predicting the frequency of North Atlantic hurricane activity. Fitzpatrick <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> also created a multiple regression scheme called the Typhoon Intensity Prediction Scheme (TIPS) to understand and forecast storm intensity in the western North Pacific Ocean. Although sometimes complicated to establish, these and other statistical analysis methods (e.g. correlation analysis, descriptive statistics) provide valuable insight regarding key associations in the climate data.</p><p>In conjunction with statistical processes, climate researchers use scatterplots and histograms that utilize either layered plots or multiple separate plots. However, the use of separate plots causes perceptual issues due to the limited memory for information that can be gained from one glance to the next as discussed by Healey et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. Statisticians often use multiple adjacent scatterplots (a scatterplot matrix, or SPLOM), as described by Wong and Bergeron <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>; but it requires a large amount of space and forming multivariate asso- , and a table view panel (lower). In this example, the mouse is used to highlight the AMM-June axis to examine its correlation with the other AMM variables. The correlation appears to be stronger for the months that are closer in time. This pattern is observed for all the AMM variables.</p><p>ciations is still difficult. Wilkinson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> employed statistical measures to organize the SPLOM and guide the viewer through exploratory analysis of high-dimensional data sets, but the perceptual issues mentioned above remain to some degree. Instead of separate plots, layer plots can be used, which condense the visualization into a single display; but there are significant issues related to layer occlusion and interference as described by Healey et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>.</p><p>In the current work, the parallel coordinates visualization technique forms the canvas for an approach designed to address the needs of climate analysis. The parallel coordinates concept, which was first popularized by Inselberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> to represent hyperdimensional geometries and also used for direct analysis of multivariate relationships by Wegman <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, yields a compact, twodimensional representation of even large multidimensional data sets. Several innovative parallel coordinates extensions have been described in the visualization research literature. For example, Martin and Ward <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> described data driven brushing techniques for parallel coordinates and Hauser et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> described a histogram display, dynamic axis re-ordering, axis inversion, and details-ondemand capabilities. In addition, Siirtola <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> presented a rich set of dynamic interaction techniques (e.g., conjunctive queries) and parallel coordinate axes enhanced with the box plots developed by Tukey <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. Johansson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> described new line shading schemes for parallel coordinates and Dykes and Mountain <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> introduce a shading approach similar to the aerial perspective shading used in the current work. Furthermore, several focus+context implementations for parallel coordinates have been introduced by Fua et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>, Artero et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>, Johansson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, and NovotÅ„y and Hauser <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. Theus <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> introduced a system that ties parallel coordinates to statistical processing functions and Qu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> introduced a method for integrating correlation computations into a parallel coordinates display. MDX utilizes variants of these extensions to enhance the classical parallel coordinates plot.</p><p>Parallel coordinates displays have also been used for environmental data analysis in earlier works. MacEachren et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> used interactive parallel coordinates to investigate atmospheric data sets. Also, Theron <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> used parallel coordinates in a visual analytics system to analyze paleoceanographic conditions. In the current work, a case study is described on the use of parallel coordinates for conducting a tropical cyclone climate study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">INFORMATION ASSISTED VISUAL ANALYSIS</head><p>MDX offers a comprehensive environment for visual multivariate data analysis by fusing automated statistical processes with enhanced parallel coordinates. The information derived from these statistical processes is used to augment the parallel coordinates axes in the form of graphical indicators that guide the user to important relationships, thereby reducing knowledge discovery timelines. The resulting visualization provides a rich blend of multivariate visualization and statistical information assistance that moves beyond conventional environmental data analysis. In the remainder of this section, we will describe the key information assistance features and the interactive visual analysis capabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Statistical Information Assistance</head><p>The statistical processes in MDX yield information that guides the scientist via graphical indicators. In real-time, the descriptive statistics and correlation measures are computed to provide key characterizations of the variables. Furthermore, regression analyses are executed on demand to quickly indicate associative connections between multiple independent and dependent variables, thus amplifying cognition and reducing analysis time frames.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Regression Processes</head><p>Regression analysis techniques are effective for screening data and providing quantitative associations. In addition to simple linear regression (SLR), MDX offers stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR) with a backwards glance, which selects the optimum number of most important variables using a predefined significance level <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. The stepwise MLR helps find a model that does a good job of predicting the dependent variable with as few independent variables as possible, which simplifies interpretation and usually means cheaper data collection and analysis. In general, the idea of stepwise regression is to start with an initial model and add or delete variables step by step, one at a time, to make the model better. The procedure stops when no appreciable improvement is gained by making another step. Although the resulting model may not be the best of all possible models, it is generally one of the best. In MDX, we use the MATLAB "regress" and "stepwisefit" utilities to perform simple and stepwise regression, respectfully. The information from these processes is parsed and graphically represented in the parallel coordinates panel. In our regression analysis, a normalization procedure is executed so that the y-intercept becomes zero and the importance of a predictor may be assessed by comparing regression coefficients, b i , between different predictors. Denoting Ïƒ as the standard deviation of a variable, y as the dependent variable, x as the predictor mean, and y as the dependent variable mean, a number k of statistically significant predictors are normalized by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(y âˆ’ y)/Ïƒ y = k âˆ‘ i=1 b i (x i âˆ’ x i )/Ïƒ i .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The b i values are graphically encoded in the parallel coordinates plot using the box below the axis label and to the left of the arrow <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2, a)</ref>. Like a thermometer, the box is filled from the bottom to the top based on the magnitude of b. The box is colored red if the coefficient is positive and blue if it is negative. The box to the right of the arrow <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2, b</ref>) encodes the r 2 output from the SLR process. In addition to the coefficients, the MLR analysis returns an overall R 2 value which provides an indication of how well the model captures the variance between the predictors and the dependent variable. The box beneath the dependent variable axis name <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2, c</ref>) encodes the overall R 2 value from the MLR analyses. It is important to note that the axis corresponding to the current dependent variable is indicated by light gray text on a dark gray box for its title <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2, d</ref>), the reverse shading of the other axes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Descriptive Statistical Indicators</head><p>The axis display also provides visual representations of key descriptive statistical measures that aid the user in ascertaining the characteristics of variable distributions. The median, interquartile range (IQR), and frequency information are calculated for the data within the focus area of each axis. Alternatively, the user can configure MDX to display the mean and standard deviation range. These central tendency and variability measures provide quantitative measures for the typical value and how "spread out" the samples are in the distribution, respectively. This information can assist the user in deriving confidence metrics (e.g. tight line clusters may indicate better stability) as well as segmenting the data into above and below normal ranges.</p><p>The variability information is encoded in the boxes that are drawn on each axis interior. The wide boxes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2, h</ref>) represent the descriptive statistics for all the axis samples, while the more narrow boxes ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2, e</ref>), which are drawn over the wide boxes, capture the descriptive statistics for the samples that are currently selected with the axis query sliders <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2, f)</ref>. The thick horizontal lines that divide the variability boxes vertically <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2, g</ref>) represent either the median or mean value.</p><p>The frequency information can also be displayed on each axis bar as vertical histogram bins <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2, i)</ref> with widths that are indicative of the number of lines that pass through the bin's region. That is, the widest bins have the most lines passing through, while the more narrow bins have less lines. The user can also enable or disable the histogram display and fine tune the bin size parameter via the MDX settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Correlation Indicators</head><p>MDX also facilitates correlation analysis whereby the strength of relationships between pairs of variables are measured. The correlation coefficient, r, is used to quantify the relationship between two variables. Specifically, the system uses the Pearson productmoment correlation coefficient to measure the correlation for a series of n measurements of X and Y written as x i and y i where i = 1, 2, . . . , n <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. The value of r is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">r = n âˆ‘ x i y i âˆ’ (âˆ‘ x i )(âˆ‘ y i ) [n âˆ‘ x i 2 âˆ’ (âˆ‘ x i ) 2 ][n âˆ‘ y i 2 âˆ’ (âˆ‘ y i ) 2 ]<label>(2)</label></formula><p>As the user interacts with the system, the correlation information is updated in real-time and used to augment the parallel coordinates display. For each possible pairing of axes, the system automatically calculates r, which yields a correlation matrix. The correlation matrix is a square matrix where each i, j element is equal to the r value between the i and j variables. The rows from this matrix are displayed graphically beneath each axis as a series of color-coded blocks <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2, j)</ref>. In each block, the color encodes r between the axis directly above it and the axis that corresponds to its position in the set of blocks. When the mouse hovers over an axis, the axis is highlighted and the correlation coefficient blocks corresponding to it below the other axes are enlarged <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2, k)</ref>.</p><p>Similar to the regression indicators, the correlation indicator blocks are shaded blue for negative correlations and red for positive. The stronger the correlation, the more saturated the color so that the stronger correlations are more prominent. The r value of an axis with itself is always equal to one and the corresponding indicator block is shaded white. Furthermore, when the absolute value for r is greater than or equal to the significant correlation threshold, the block is colored with the fully saturated color. Displayed at the bottom of the parallel coordinates display (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>), the significant correlation threshold is a user-defined value that controls the correlation block shading and the multicollinearity filter.</p><p>In addition to the indicator blocks, MDX displays small scatterplots below the correlation indicators for each axis when an axis is highlighted <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2, m)</ref>. The scatterplots are created by plotting the points with the highlighted variable as the y axis and the variable directly above the scatterplot as the x axis. Each scatterplot also shows the numerical r value associated with the pair of axes below the scatterplot <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2, n)</ref>. The scatterplots provide a visual means to confirm the type of correlation (positive or negative) and the strength. The type of correlation is also visually detectable in the line configuration of the parallel coordinates plot. Polylines that cross in an 'X' pattern are characteristic of a negative correlation while lines that appear to be more parallel indicate a positive correlation. Unlike the other correlation indicators, the scatterplot is useful for discovering nonlinear relationships between variables. For example, a nonlinear relationship can be observed in a scatterplot even if r is zero.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.4">Multicollinearity Filter</head><p>Multicollinearity is a condition in which an independent variable is highly correlated with several other independent variables. This variable has much in common with several other variables and may have little information unique to itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. The presence of this condition results in loss of power and makes interpretation more difficult in the results of regression models.</p><p>MDX provides an automated multicollinearity filter to ensure the proper selection of axes in subsequent regression analyses. The filter examines the visible axes in the parallel coordinates display for multicollinearity; if any axes are correlated with each other by more than the significant correlation threshold, one is removed from the display. The filter removes the axis that has a lower r with the dependent axis and the remaining axis are truly independent of each other. Although the user can use the correlation indicators to manually reduce the multicollinearity, the automatic filter can be used to ensure independence among the variables by simply clicking a user interface button.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.5">Axis Ordering</head><p>MDX expedites statistical comparisons through its automatic axis arrangement capabilities, which use one of the previously mentioned statistical measures. When the axes are arranged by the correlation coefficient, one axis is selected initially as the target axis. The axes are then sorted according to the r value of the target axis and the other visible axes. Axes with negative correlations are arranged to the left of the target axis in ascending order. Axes with positive correlations are arranged to the right of the target axis in descending order. The strongest correlations are placed nearest to the target axis while the weakest correlations are placed farthest. When the axes are sorted in this manner, the user can quickly identify the strongest correlations with the target axis.</p><p>The IQR / standard deviation range, MLR b, and SLR r 2 options all sort the axes in descending order based on the statistical values. The dependent axis is placed at the leftmost position and the other axes are arranged accordingly. The IQR / standard deviation range arrangements are useful for examining the dispersion characteristics of each axis. The SLR r 2 and MLR b arrangements are useful for investigating individual associations of the axes with the dependent axis and identifying the most significant axes for the dependent axis, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Visual Analysis Techniques</head><p>In addition to several fundamental parallel coordinates capabilities such as relocatable axes, axis inversion, and details-on-demand, MDX includes additional extensions such as rapid axis scaling, focus+context, aerial perspective shading, and dynamic visual queries. A detailed description of these capabilities are provided in earlier publications of this research <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref>. In the remainder of this section, we give an overview of the more significant extensions to set the stage for the subsequent climate study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Dynamic Queries</head><p>MDX enables the rapid selection of subsets of polylines in the parallel coordinates display using double-ended sliders. Each axis has a pair of sliders <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2, f)</ref> for constraining the upper and lower limits of the highlighted lines. The user can drag these sliders using the mouse to perform rapid Boolean AND queries. Lines within the sliders of each axis are rendered with a darker shade of gray while the remaining lines are rendered with a less prominent shade of gray. An example of this capability is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> to highlight above normal IH activity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Axis Scaling (Focus+Context)</head><p>The dynamic axis scaling capabilities in MDX enable interactive exploration of data subsets while retaining the context of the full  data set. This capability is implemented by allowing the user to modify the upper and lower focus area values for a selected axis using the movement of the mouse wheel. Each axis is partitioned into three sections delineated by horizontal tick marks: the central focus area and the top and bottom context areas. When the mouse hovers over the focus area (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>), an upward mouse wheel motion expands the display of the focus area outward and pushes lines outside the new upper and lower limits into the context areas. A downward wheel motion causes the inverse effect: focus area compression. Alternatively, the user may use the mouse wheel over either of the two context areas to alter the minimum or maximum limits, independently. This intuitive capability supports zooming into an area of interest for an axis to reduce clutter and facilitate focused analysis on specific polylines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Aerial Perspective Shading</head><p>MDX also provides a proximity-based line shading scheme, which supports rapid investigation of multidimensional trends. This shading scheme simulates the human perception of aerial perspective whereby objects in the distance appear faded while objects nearer to the eye seem more vivid. The technique is similar to a fundamental painting technique often employed in landscapes. As the distance between the viewer and an object is increased, the contrast between the object and the background decreases.</p><p>The shading scheme is implemented in MDX in both a discrete and a continuous mode. In the discrete mode, the lines are colored according to the axis region that they intersect. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>, lines that are within the query slider limits for each axis are shaded with a dark gray value that draws the user's attention. Lines that fall within the context of any axis are shaded a light gray color and drawn beneath the other lines. The remaining lines (non-query and non-context) are colored a shade of gray that is darker than the context lines but lighter than the query lines.</p><p>In the continuous mode, non-context lines go through an additional step to encode the distance of the line from the mouse cursor. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>, query lines that are nearest to the mouse cursor receive the darkest value while lines farthest from the mouse cursor are shaded with a lighter gray. The other query lines are shaded according to a non-linear fall-off function that yields a gradient of colors between said extremes. Consequently, the lines that are nearest to the mouse cursor are more prominent to the viewer due to the color and depth ordering treatments and the viewer can effectively use the mouse to quickly interrogate the data set. In addition to the  query lines, the shading scheme is also applied to the small scatterplots that are displayed beneath each axis to link the elements over multiple views.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CASE STUDY: NORTH ATLANTIC HURRICANE TREND ANALYSIS</head><p>The objective of this research is to show the promise of an approach to interactive visual analytics that relies on guidance from statistical information. Building on our earlier case studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref>, we have employed this approach in the current work by investigating trends in a new environmental data set and ascertaining the significance of the data set in comparison to a related data set of hurricane predictors. The discovery of hidden trends, confirmation of known patterns, and feedback from the domain expert reveal the potential for enhanced knowledge discovery in climate studies. In the remainder of this section, we provide an overview of the climate data along with details of the analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Climate Data</head><p>This climate study involves two data sets that contain environmental predictors for hurricane seasons. The first data set contains 16 climate predictors observed annually from 1950 to 2006 (57 records) and they are listed along with the associated geographical region in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. This data set was provided by Dr. Phil Klotzbach <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> of the Tropical Meteorology Project at Colorado State University (CSU), where it has been used in forecasts of the 2007 North Atlantic hurricane season activity by categories. These categories include the number of named storms (NS) 1 , the number of hurricanes (H) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2</ref> , and the number of intense hurricanes (IH) 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>. The CSU variables have known association with North Atlantic hurricane activity. For example, Chu <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref> describes how this basin has less storms during the El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) years, and more in La NiÃ±a years. Because of this relationship, scientists use the ENSO signals as one the primary predictors for <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1</ref> A tropical cyclone is given a name when its winds reach 17 ms âˆ’1 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2</ref> Hurricanes are tropical cyclones with winds that exceed 32 ms âˆ’1 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref> Intense hurricanes are hurricanes with winds that are at least 49 ms âˆ’1 . seasonal activity. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, variables 1 through 8 are understood to characterize ENSO events. This data set's description is beyond the scope of this paper, and the reader is directed to Steed et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> for those details.</p><p>In this climate study, we also include the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) data set, which has been obtained from the Earth Systems Research Laboratory of the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Recent research by Vimont and Kossin <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref> has shown strong relationships between the AMM and North Atlantic storm activity on decadal and interannual time series. The AMM is a dynamic mode of variability that is integral to the tropical coupled ocean-atmosphere system. These connections are due to the AMM's association with several local climate conditions, which all influence storm activity collectively as described by Vimont and Kossin <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. AMM is highly correlated with a number of local climatic factors such as SST, shear, low-level vorticity and convergence, static stability, and SLP. The local factors cooperate to increase or decrease North Atlantic hurricane activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>.</p><p>To align with the years covered by the CSU data set, we use a subset of the AMM data set in this study to cover the years 1950 to 2006. For each year, the AMM data set has 12 values, one for each month of the year. The AMM spatial pattern is determined by applying a Maximum Covariance Analysis to sea surface temperature and the zonal and meridional components of the 10-meter wind field. The data are defined over the region (21S-32N, 74W-15E), and smoothed spatially using 3 longitude and 2 latitude points <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">AMM Exploratory Analyses</head><p>We began the study by investigating the trends and associations within the AMM data set. One of the first features we observed is that all of the correlation indicators are red (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>), which indicates positive correlations. The correlation indicators also highlight that the AMM variables have strong positive correlations with months that are near in time. For example, the AMM-June variable is highlighted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, which reveals exceptionally strong correlations with the four nearest months (AMM-April, AMM-May, AMM-July, and AMM-August) and considerably weaker correlation with the other months. A glance at the correlation indicator patterns shows that each AMM variable exhibits this pattern-the correlation strengths falls off as the temporal separation increases.</p><p>When we evaluate the correlations of the AMM variables with the IH axis, we observe that the highest correlations occur in the months that historically have the highest intense hurricane activity. In <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>, the AMM-August and AMM-September months have the second and third strongest correlation with the IH axis. It is not surprising that the weakest correlations with the IH activity are observed in the winter and spring months, which are outside the North Atlantic hurricane season (Jun. 1 to Nov. 30); but it is remarkable that the strongest correlation is with the AMM-December axis. The red correlation indicators and scatterplots beneath each axis also show that each AMM variable is positively correlated with the IH activity. We observed similar correlations trends with the NS and H categories; but the correlations with the other seasonal statistics were slightly weaker than with the IH statistic.</p><p>Using the axis sliders, we compare the AMM variable values for seasons with above normal and below normal IH activity. The above normal seasons are highlighted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> to show that as AMM values increase, the IH activity also increases. This observation reinforces the positive correlation between the AMM variables and the IH variable. The AMM variables were also examined for seasons with above and below normal NS and H activity and the same positive correlation trends were observed.</p><p>After exploring the AMM variables in isolation, the next phase of our analysis included the CSU data set. The 12 AMM were plotted with the 16 CSU parameters and the IH dependent variable for 29 total variables-the first simultaneous visualization of these <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Correlation analysis of the AMM variables with the IH category shows that all correlations are positive and AMM-December has the strongest correlation, but December is known to be a quiet month for hurricane activity. The other strong correlations (AMM-August and AMM-September ) are within the active portion of the hurricane season. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>: The query sliders are used to examine the seasons with above normal IH activity. The resulting line configuration shows that higher activity levels coincide with higher AMM values. particular parameters. This figure is not shown due to space limitations, but it demonstrates that the visualization technique is only restricted by the horizontal resolution of the display. In this case, the overview of all the parameters revealed that the AMM have much more gradually changing line configurations between axes.</p><p>We investigated the correlations between the IH axis and the 28 independent variables. We used the MDX axis arrangement capabilities to order the axes according to the correlation coefficient with the IH axis. This analysis reveals that the 4 strongest correlations are with AMM variables (AMM-December, AMM-September, AMM-August, and AMM-November). Similar correlation analyses were executed for the H and NS categories. For the H statistic, the 6 strongest correlations are with AMM variables: AMM-December, AMM-November, AMM-September, AMM-August, AMM-October, and AMM-July. For the NS statistic, the 5 strongest correlations are with AMM variables: AMM-November, AMM-December, AMM-October, AMM-September, and AMM-August.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Identifying Significant Predictors</head><p>To determine the most significant predictors among the CSU and AMM variables for predicting seasonal hurricane activity, we used the MDX stepwise regression analysis capabilities. We generated 3 regression models for each of the seasonal categories: NS, H, and IH. These are the same dependent variables used in our earlier regression analysis using only the CSU predictors <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. The significance level is 80%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Multicollinearity Filter</head><p>Prior to running regression processes, the multicollinearity filter was executed in 3 separate cases (one for each for the IH, H, and NS dependent variables) for the full data set. In all three cases, the filter removed 17 of the independent variables from the axis configuration, leaving 11 variables in the display. For the IH and H cases, only 2 AMM variables are included in the new configuration: AMM-December and AMM-May. With the IH case, the unfiltered axes were arranged according by the correlation coefficients with the dependent axis to reveal that the AMM-December axis has the highest correlation (r = .64). Similar visual analysis after multicollinearity filtering for the H category also reveals that AMM-December has the strongest correlation (r = .62)-a significantly stronger correlation than the second highest correlation (r = .47) with November 500-mb Geopotential Height <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref>.</p><p>For the NS case, 3 AMM variables remain after the filter execution: AMM-November, AMM-January, and AMM-June. Analysis of the remaining variables reveals that the highest correlation coefficient is with the AMM-November axis (r = .62), which is substantially stronger than the second strongest correlation (r = .41) with the November 500-mb Geopotential Height (12) axis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Regression Analyses</head><p>After executing the multicollinearity filter, the stepwise regression capabilities are used to identify the most significant predictors among the remaining 11 variables. With the IH variable as the dependent variable, the regression model includes the 5 variables shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6</ref>. The R 2 value for this model is 65%, which is better than the 58% obtained in our prior case studies that used only the CSU predictors <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref>. In this model, the AMM-December variable has the highest regression coefficient (b = 0.3421). The other 4 variables included in the model are from the CSU data set, which were also included in the prior CSU case studies. The only variable not selected in this model that was selected in the previous studies is September-November SLP in the southeast Gulf of Mexico <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>. This variable is omitted because the AMM explained more variance and variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref> could no longer explain any new variance in this particular model.</p><p>When the H variable is set to the dependent variable, the regression model included the 4 variables shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7</ref>. The R 2 value for this model is 56%, which is significantly better than the 42% from the prior CSU data set analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. Similar to the IH regression model, the AMM-December variable had the strongest regression coefficient (b = 0.5027)-significantly higher than the next strongest coefficient (b = âˆ’0.2404). Like the previous CSU analyses, this model includes both the October-November SLP <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(6)</ref> and November 500-mb Geopotential Height (12) variables; but, in the current model, variable (6) has the lowest coefficient instead of the highest. Furthermore, the AMM+CSU model drops the June-July SLP <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref> and September-November SLP (11) variables and includes the February 200-mb zonal wind in equatorial East Brazil (3) variable. Variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref> are dropped for the same reason that the IH model drops variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>. However, the model keeps variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(6)</ref>, which also measures SLP. The reason variable (6) is retained and variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref> are dropped is possibly due to geographic locations-variable (6) is measured in the Gulf  of Alaska and variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref> are measured in areas that overlap the AMM variables. Since variable (6) has the weakest correlation with AMM-December of these 3 SLP variables (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8</ref>), it was not included in the model for the H category since there was little new variance to explain. The NS regression model includes only 3 variables and yields an R 2 value of 45%, which is better than the 34% from the prior CSU analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. The only variable in the current model that was also included in the CSU analyses is November 500-mb Geopotential Height <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref>. Like the H model, the AMM+CSU NS model includes the October-November SLP (6) variable due to the weak correlation with AMM-November since it is measured in the Gulf of Alaska. The February SST (14) is removed by the multicollinearity filter process because it is strongly correlated with the AMM-November variable (r = .56) and it has a weaker correlation with the dependent variable (r = .42) than AMM-November. Similarly, the September-November SLP (11) variable is removed by the filter because it is strongly correlated with the AMM-January variable (r = âˆ’.58) and it has a weaker correlation with the dependent variable (r = âˆ’.32) than AMM-January (r = .33). Unlike the other two AMM regression models, this model results in the exclusion of the AMM-December variable, which is also removed during the multicollinearity filter process due to strong correlation with the AMM-November variable (r = .92).</p><p>In the H and NS models, the February 200-mb U (3) and October-November SLP (6) variables are CSU predictors that are not included in the prior CSU regression models <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. These variables are correlated to El NiÃ±o conditions. They are likely included in the model because, as Vimont and Kossin <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> state, the AMM is largely independent of ENSO. In <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, the independence of these variables can be observed in the lack of correlation between the 12 AMM variables and the June-July NiÃ±o 3 (1) variable.</p><p>It is also remarkable that the November 500-mb Geopotential Height (12) variable was included in the 3 AMM+CSU regression models, as well as the 3 prior CSU regression models <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. This variable measures the long-term oscillations that impact global wind patterns. Specifically, it represents a different climate signal from the AMM that is called the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Vimont and Kossin <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> state that the AMM and the NAO are independent during the hurricane season which may explain its inclusion in all 3 AMM models. Furthermore, the fact that the geographic regions for variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref> and the AMM do not overlap contributes to the independence of the variables. Since variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref> is chosen in all regression case studies, it should be regarded as a significant signal for forecasting and studying hurricane seasons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Discussion</head><p>As mentioned earlier, conventional visual analytics tools used in climate studies are usually restricted to static plots that lack linkages to statistical processes and are not well-suited to today's complex data sets. MDX overcomes these deficiencies by integrating the statistical and visualization processes for more rapid and creative knowledge discovery. This integration significantly reduced timelines for collaborative analyses with our domain expert, Dr. Fitzpatrick, from days to hours. In addition, the ability to directly interact with the data behind the visualization via dynamic visual queries is a vast improvement over conventional static plots. Dr. Fitzpatrick indicated that MDX made it possible to explore the associations in the climate data sets quicker and more comprehensively than traditional approaches. He also noted that MDX automated and streamlined the main statistical processes that are typically employed in his studies, such as manual multicollinearity analysis.</p><p>In addition to spotlighting significant associations in the data set, the graphical statistical indicators provide a visual uncertainty metric, which informs the user. For example, a tight clustering of lines in parallel coordinates might indicate a relatively stable predictor that may yield better results than another predictor with more dispersed lines. These statistical indicators can also directly guide the user, as illustrated in our use of the central tendency and variability measures to partition the distributions into active, normal, and inactive seasons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>This research has shown, via a practical climate study, the promise of an enhanced parallel coordinates visual analytics approach with statistical information assistance. The new approach overcomes several limitations of traditional climate analysis techniques and enhances knowledge discovery. In our climate study of hurricane trends, we demonstrated several remarkable associations in the analysis of the AMM and CSU data sets regarding seasonal measures of activity. In the future, we will explore additional statistical processes as well as new techniques to encode the resulting information. These enhanced analysis capabilities demonstrate tremendous potential to improve our understanding of complex environmental phenomenon. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>: Correlation analysis between the AMM variables and June-July NiÃ±o 3 (1) reveals weak correlations-very lightly saturated correlation blocks, dispersed scatterplots, and low r values-that reinforces that theory that AMM is largely independent of the ENSO.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The MDX system developed in this research is composed of a settings panel (upper left), parallel coordinates panel (upper right)</figDesc></figure>
