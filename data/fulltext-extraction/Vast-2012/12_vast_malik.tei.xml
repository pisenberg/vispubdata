				<p>Finding patterns and trends in spatial and temporal datasets has been a long studied problem in statistics and different domains of science. This paper presents a visual analytics approach for the interactive exploration and analysis of spatiotemporal correlations among multivariate datasets. Our approach enables users to discover correlations and explore potentially causal or predictive links at different spatiotemporal aggregation levels among the datasets, and allows them to understand the underlying statistical foundations that precede the analysis. Our technique utilizes the Pearson&apos;s product-moment correlation coefficient and factors in the lead or lag between different datasets to detect trends and periodic patterns amongst them.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>With more and more agencies collecting and storing data pertaining to different processes, modern datasets often become complex and too large to handle, triggering a need for solutions that make the exploration and analysis of these datasets more manageable. One specific opportunity created by such multivariate and multisource data is the potential to look for correlations and explore possible causal or predictive links from these datasets. The challenges with such analysis, though, include end-users and decision makers understanding the underlying statistical algorithms, applying the algorithms at the appropriate temporal and spatial scale, and dealing with the noisiness of the real-world data. Therefore, a visual analytics environment to enable analysts to explore and understand potential correlations at different scales and with various certainties is necessary for effective decision making.</p><p>In this paper, we present a visual analytics approach for exploring correlations among multivariate spatiotemporal datasets. Our correlative analysis framework enables users to detect trends and patterns among datasets using statistical techniques that are oftentimes complex and difficult to understand by both novice and advanced users. Furthermore, we argue that if the users were to rely on mere statistical results without the aid of any interactive visualization or visual analytic tools, there remains the potential that they may miss certain important details. The use of visual representations of data and of the different analytical processes minimizes these risks and provides more insights to users than traditional methods.</p><p>Our correlative visual analytics framework also enables users to understand the benefits and harms of performing their analyses over aggregate statistics, where datasets are aggregated and compared over spatial (e.g., by census blocks or census tracts), or temporal (e.g., by day, week, month or year) units. For example, users may find no relevant patterns or anomalies when they perform an analysis over large spatial or temporal regions but may discover trends over customized spatiotemporal regions. We incorporate this concept in our system, and allow users to interactively correlate any data subsets to assist them in the discovery of underlying patterns and anomalies.</p><p>Our current work builds upon our previous framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> that has been developed to explore and analyze spatiotemporal datasets. A screenshot of our system is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. This system provides users with a suite of analytical tools that are coupled with interactive visual interfaces for exploring criminal, traffic and civil (CTC) datasets. Our system allows users to observe patterns and quickly identify regions with higher probabilities of activity. Our current work focuses on interactive correlative visualization and analysis methods of spatiotemporal datasets in a visual analytics environment. We emphasize that although the examples provided in this paper are based in the law enforcement domain, our approach is extendible to any spatiotemporal dataset framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>In recent years, there has been much work exploring multivariate datasets in the spatiotemporal domain that enables the discovery and detection of trends, patterns and anomalies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>). In this section, we discuss previous work in the areas of spatiotemporal analysis and visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Time series visualizations</head><p>The visualization of time series data is one of the most common problems in any data domain, and, as such, much work has been done to address the challenges associated with visualizing time series data. Common methods of visualizing time series datasets include line graphs and bar charts. An overview of some existing techniques for visualizing time series datasets can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Our work primarily utilizes line and bar graphs, clock views and calendar view visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> to support a temporal visualization of the data.</p><p>Researchers have also explored different techniques that provide interactive visual analysis methods for time series datasets. Bade et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> present different interactive visualization techniques that reveal data at different levels of detail and abstraction. They augment the standard temporal visualizations to include implicit information with regards to the data as well as a priori knowledge pertaining to the data. Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> present an exploratory time-series visualization technique that allows users to focus on areas of interest in the data through magnification and visual filtering. Javed et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> also explore user performance for different line graph techniques that involve multiple time series to provide guidelines for designers designing temporal visualization applications. Buono et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> provide a review of techniques that enable users to interactively query time series datasets and present a data exploration tool that allows users to explore multidimensional datasets in an Overview+Detail design. Their system enables users to interactively search for existing patterns to find similar temporal occurrences and trends. We adapt an Overview+Detail design for the visualization of datasets by providing users with different temporal aggregation levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology 2012</head><p>October 14 -19, Seattle, WA, USA 978-1-4673-4753-2/12/$31.00 ©2012 IEEE <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: A screenshot of our correlative visual analytics system. Here, the user is visualizing all crimes related to noise complaints and drunkenness/public intoxication in Tippecanoe County, IN. The main viewing area (a) shows the map view with the points showing the locations of the selected offenses on the map for the week of 1/3/2011 to 1/9/2011. The top-right window (b) shows an interactive menu that allows users to filter through the variables of the datasets. The middle window (c) shows the weekly time-series view of the selected incident reports, where the user is performing a correlative analysis of the system, the results of which are displayed in the correlation vs. lead/lag graph (d). The region of overlap between the time series in (c) is colored by the corresponding correlation value based on a divergent color scale (e). The left window (f) shows the calendar view for the year 2011, and the right window (g) shows a clock view of the selected incident report data for the week of 1/3/2011 to 1/9/2011. Finally, the bottom-left window (h) shows the time slider with radio buttons that allow different temporal aggregation levels.</p><p>Datasets that are large in size often tend to be incomplete, unreliable and contradictory. This often leads to wrong conclusions and results and it becomes imperative for system designers to make users aware of data reliability issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Aigner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> provide a visualization technique that represents uncertainties in the temporal domain. Their approach provides users with temporal glyphs that support planning and controlling tasks. We make a note here that data accuracy and reliability becomes an important measure for analysts to review and understand in any correlative analysis process. This becomes especially important to consider when the datasets being analyzed are sparse, as correlating such datasets may produce unreliable results. Our system allows users to visualize sparse datasets during the analysis process by showing a percent of cases that have zero values in the time series. This is especially helpful in case of incident report datasets (e.g., CTC incidents) where there may be a certain categories that have very few incidents thereby leading to sparse datasets. In addition, we also allow users to choose different data aggregation levels as a method of aggregating sparse data to appropriate levels, thereby allowing them to utilize their domain knowledge to determine the appropriate scales for analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Time series data pattern and anomaly detection</head><p>Works in the field of time series data exploration, pattern and anomaly detection includes work by Krstajic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> who present an incremental time-series visualization technique that interactively distorts time-based representations of multiple event datasets. Their technique uses a timeline distortion technique to accommodate for recent data within individual items. The authors note that many analytical tasks can be more efficiently solved by using interactive visual analytic tools that include the analyst at different stages of the exploration process. We incorporate the same concept in our system, and provide a correlative analysis framework that incorporates the analyst in the visual analytics loop. Hao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> also present a framework for visualizing large sets of time series datasets. Their approach involves importance-driven space-filling layout schemes for time series datasets. Lin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> present a time series pattern discovery and visualization system that summarizes the global and local structures of time series datasets. Their system enables the discovery of motifs and anomalies and uses a coefficient to measure the dissimilarity between any two time series. Kincaid <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> uses a Focus+Context approach to visualize electronic test and measurement system datasets and allows users to filter and detect and visualize computationally detected motifs in the data. Malik et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> utilize a visual analytics approach for exploring linear correlations across a variety of spatial aggregations to allow analysts to explore global temporal correlations, as well as explore the underlying spatial factors that may potentially influence trends among their datasets. Corman and Mocan <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> utilize high frequency time series criminal incident datasets and perform time series analyses to explore the relationship among crime, deterrence and drug use. Our approach deals with determining the correlations among datasets in a visual analytics environment that enable analysts to compare different datasets by factoring in temporal leads/lags among them.</p><p>Other methods in statistics for detecting relationships between time series datasets include computing the cross-correlation of two different signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. This approach applies a time-lag function to one of the time series signals while keeping the other time series fixed. The process of computing the correlation of a time series signal with itself (with lag) is called autocorrelation, and the resulting plot of the sample autocorrelations plotted against the time lags is called a correlogram <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. This technique is widely used in the detection of repeating patterns and randomness within the datasets. We adapt a similar process of correlating the datasets by sliding the datasets against one another and providing an interactive interface that enables users to explore and understand potential correlations between the datasets at different spatiotemporal scales.</p><p>Recent work in exploring time series similarity detection methods include Morse and Patel <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> who propose a method that can be used to evaluate different threshold value techniques that measure the similarity between time series datasets. Bollobas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> present deterministic and randomized algorithms for determining the similarity between two time series datasets. Das et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> also consider the problem of finding rules that relate different patterns within the same time series. They focus on the discovery of local patterns in multivariate time series datasets. Many of these data mining techniques rely on comparing elements of one time series dataset with the elements of the other datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Spatiotemporal exploration of predictive links</head><p>Researchers have also utilized multivariate datasets for forecasting purposes and have developed systems that factor in categorical datasets in order to generate alerts and projections into the future. Buono et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> present a data driven forecasting method that employs pattern matching search using historic datasets. Maciejewski et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> also implement predictive analytical tools in analyzing syndromic surveillance data. Toole et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> utilize crosscorrelation measures and other techniques to identify spatiotemporal patterns using multivariate datasets. Rodrigues and Diggle <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> adapt Log-Cox processes to model the spatiotemporal crime intensities where the probabilistic predictions of the crime intensities are made in the Bayesian framework.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">CORRELATIVE EXPLORATION IN A VISUAL ANALYTICS ENVIRONMENT</head><p>Understanding relationships between spatial and temporal trends among multivariate datasets is an important part in the analysis process of spatiotemporal datasets. Such analyses often act as a precursor to creating predictive models from the data. Moreover, such analyses can provide invaluable insights into the workings of real world environments and can aid analysts in their hypothesis generation and exploration process. However, this process of determining these potential relationships remains a challenging problem due to reasons ranging from datasets being noisy to analysts being strained due to the nature and complexity of their datasets. Our approach focuses on determining the correlations between different spatiotemporal datasets. Correlation is a single number that describes the relationship between two variables. In the case of temporal datasets, we use correlation to describe the degree to which two variables are related to each other. Our method applies to collections of categorical spatiotemporal datasets and allows users to compute the correlations between any pair of variables among any of the given datasets, each of which may consist of different number of variables. We use the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (Pearson's correlation -r xy ) in our analysis, which is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">r xy = ∑ N i=1 (x i −x)(y i −ȳ) (N − 1)S x S y (1)</formula><p>where N is the length of the time series datasets,x andȳ are the means of the time series x and y respectively, and S x and S y are the standard deviations of the time series x and y between the regions of overlap. We also apply a two sided t-test to check if the correlation obtained is significant within a 95% confidence interval with N-2 degrees of freedom. This two sided t-test is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">t = r xy (1 − r 2 xy )/(N − 2)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>We also observe that there may be different forces that determine the nature of the relationships between different datasets. For example, one event may be a precursor to a series of other events. This would require the exploration of leads and lags between different datasets in order to understand if one dataset is related to the other at a different temporal location (i.e., a lead or lag value). Our system incorporates this concept in the analysis process, and allows users to determine the lead or lag that maximizes the correlation, thereby enabling them to determine the lead/lag values that maximize the similarity among the datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Visual Analytics Environment</head><p>Our visual analytics framework builds upon our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and provides analysts and decision makers with the ability to visualize and model criminal, traffic and civil (CTC) incidents. <ref type="figure">Figure</ref> 1 shows a screenshot of our correlative visual analytics system. Our system has been organized into a dashboard view and provides users with linked dynamic windows to explore their spatiotemporal datasets. The main viewing region <ref type="figure">(Figure 1 (a)</ref>) is the map view that plots all selected incidents on a map. We utilize a kernel density estimation technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> to generate heatmaps to allow users to quickly detect hotspots among the CTC incidents. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> (b) shows an interactive menu that is used to filter through the different dataset variables (e.g., offenses, agencies). <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> (c) shows a time series view of the selected incidents, along with a correlation vs. lead/lag graph <ref type="figure">(Figure 1 (d)</ref>) that shows the correlation of one dataset against the other at different lead and lags between them. The region of overlap between the time series ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> (c)) is also encoded by a color on a divergent color scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>  <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref> (e)) to reflect the correlation value at the current lead/lag value. These points will be expanded upon later in Section 3.2 of the paper. <ref type="figure">Figure</ref> 1 (f) implements the calendar view approach adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and displays the time series data in the format of a calendar, with the rows corresponding to weeks and the columns corresponding to the days of the week. The bar charts at the end of each row and column of the calendar view encode the sum of incidents for a particular week and day, respectively. <ref type="figure">Figure 1 (g)</ref> shows a clock view that shows the hourly temporal data in the form of a clock. Finally, <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> (h) shows the interactive time slider that allows users to temporally slide through their datasets and provides them with multiple temporal data aggregation levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Temporal Correlation Exploration</head><p>We provide three different interactive options for users to determine the temporal correlation between datasets. The first option involves providing the user with control over the correlation computation process and allows him/her to directly set the lead or lag between the datasets for use in correlation calculations by manually dragging any of the selected time series datasets. The second option automatically computes the correlations at different leads or lags between the selected datasets and outputs the lead/lag that maximizes the correlation. The third option utilizes a brute force algorithm and computes the correlations between all possible permutations of the different data variables and saves the results in the decreasing order <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Interactive calculation of correlation between datasets. The user has clicked and dragged the time series data in red to the right by 8 units. The system automatically computes the correlation and significance (using the t-test) of the two time series data between the regions of overlap (shown by the black rectangle).</p><p>of the number of significant correlation values. This allows analysts to review all potentially significant correlations among their datasets. We describe these options in detail below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Manual dragging of datasets</head><p>This option allows users to determine the correlation between any selected datasets at any desired lag/lead. In order to determine the correlations between these different time series datasets, our system allows users to simply click on a line on the time series graph <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref> (c)) and drag it either to the left or the right. This action automatically computes the correlation between the selected time series dataset, and the other selected datasets and interactively displays the results to the user. In addition to displaying the correlation value, the system also colors the region of overlap between the time series datasets on a divergent color scale <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref> (e)) to encode the current correlation value. The system also displays the current lead/lag value corresponding to the length of the difference between the time series datasets (which, in turn, corresponds to the length of the drag by the user). In our implementation, if the user selects multiple datasets at the same time and clicks on a line graph to compute the correlation, we take a sum of all the other temporal datasets and correlate the selected time series dataset with this summed dataset. We plan on investigating other methods of computing the correlations among multiple datasets and leave this as future work. We also note that this process of manually dragging the datasets provides users with complete control over the correlation process by setting any desired lead/lag between the time series datasets. This enables them to visually explore the potential correlations between the datasets. Furthermore, users may apply any desired spatiotemporal filters to their datasets and acquire the time series for any of the desired variables pertaining to their datasets.</p><p>Since Pearson's correlation calculation requires the two time series datasets be of equal lengths, we utilize two different approaches with regards to the non-overlapping regions of the datasets when the user introduces a lead/lag by dragging the time series graph either to the left or right:</p><p>• Calculating the correlation between the regions of overlap: This approach calculates the correlation between only the overlapped regions of the time series datasets, and ignores all the nonoverlapping temporal regions. Correspondingly, when the time series x lags behind the time series y, the correlation calculation (Equation 1) changes to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">r xy (d) = ∑ N d i=1 (x i+d −x)(y i −ȳ) (N d − 1)S x S y<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">N d = (N − d),</formula><p>x andȳ are the means of the time series x and y respectively, S x and S y are the standard deviations of the time series x and y between the regions of overlap, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">d = {0, 1, ...., ⌈ N 4</formula><p>⌉} is the lag between time series x with respect to y. Similarly, when the time series x leads y by a value of d units, Equation 1 changes to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">r xy (d) = ∑ N d i=1 (x i −x)(y i+d −ȳ) (N d − 1)S x S y<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The corresponding t-test equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">Equation 2</ref>thus becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">t = r xy (d) (1 − r 2 xy (d))/(N d − 2)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>An example of this method can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, where the user has chosen to visualize two temporal datasets, and has dragged the series in the red color to the right by a distance of 8 units. The other time series (black color) remains stationary.</p><p>We then compute the correlation of the two time series between the overlapping region only and display this value as a number, along with the corresponding significance as a result of applying the t-test.</p><p>• Cycling the non-overlapping regions: This method allows users to cycle the non-overlapping temporal regions of a selected time series dataset to either its beginning or end as the user drags the time series to the right or left on the graph, respectively. This cycling strategy is demonstrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>, where the user has dragged the top time series to the right by 12 units, resulting in the time series shown at the bottom of the <ref type="figure">Figure.</ref> The system automatically cycles the points at the end of the top time series to its beginning, resulting in the time series shown at the bottom. This newly generated time series is then utilized in the correlation calculations (using Equations 1 and 2). This approach, coupled with temporal region selection described in Section 3.2.3, allows analysts to determine the cyclic trends in their datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Automatic correlation computation against lead/lags</head><p>In addition to computing the correlation at a desired lead/lag dictated by the user (Section 3.2.1), the system also provides users with the option to automatically determine the lead/lag that maximizes the correlation between the selected datasets. When this option is selected, the user starts by simply clicking on the desired time series plot that he/she wants to perform the correlative analysis on. <ref type="figure">Figure 1 (c)</ref> shows an example where the user is visualizing the weekly drunkenness/public intoxication offenses against noise complaints for Tippecanoe County, Indiana, U.S.A. for all 52 weeks of the year 2011. In this example, the user has selected the time series plot of drunkenness/public intoxication offenses (shown in red color), and is analyzing how these compare against noise complaints. The system computes the correlation values at corresponding lead/lag values (ranging between ±N/4, where N is the total length of the datasets), and displays them as a bar graph of the computed correlation values with respect to the lead/lag ( <ref type="figure">Figure  1 (d)</ref>). The ±N/4 metric has been adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and is chosen because as the lead/lag value increases, the region of overlap between the datasets (and hence the correlation sample size) decreases, thereby making the correlation estimate of the overlapping datasets less reliable. We also note that the resulting plot ( <ref type="figure">Figure  1 (d)</ref>) resembles a correlogram in that we plot the results of the correlation process as correlation values against time lags. The system also applies the t-test for the correlation values obtained at each lead/lag value and checks whether the correlation is significant or not at a given lead/lag. The statistically significant correlation values are highlighted with green colored bars (for positive correlation), or red colored bars (for negative correlation) at the corresponding lead/lag value. This is done in order to reduce the risk of users making wrong inferences from the correlation results, as positive and negative correlation values have different statistical meanings and implications in real world scenarios. The system also animates the two graphs by iterating through lead/lag values with a step size of 1 time unit, updating the two graphs simultaneously. This animation starts from a lead value of −N/4 and ends at a lag value of +N/4, and lasts for about 5 seconds for N = 365 days. We find this animation length to be enough time for users to understand the underlying process <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The corresponding correlation vs. lead/lag graph is dynamically linked to the main graph, and the correlation value corresponding to the current lead/lag value is highlighted on the global correlation graph (using a blue colored outline at the current lead/lag value).</p><p>Finally, when the current lead/lag value reaches the maximum lag value of +N/4, the animation proceeds and ends at the lead/lag value that maximizes the correlation between the datasets (this happens at a lead/lag value of 3 weeks in <ref type="figure">Figure 1 (d)</ref>). Note that the system also allows users to interactively click on any of the time series datasets and drag it to the left or right to interactively move it (just like in the manual correlation option described in Section 3.2.1), and visualize the datasets at a desired lead/lag corresponding to the correlation vs. lead/lag graph. We note that the user may choose to disable the animation at any time in which case the system resorts to displaying only the end results (e.g., <ref type="figure">Figure 1 (d)</ref>).</p><p>We further note that all the options described in Section 3.2.1 apply equally in the automatic correlation computation mode. Specifically, in the auto-computation mode, we allow users to: (a) discard the non-overlapping temporal regions while calculating the correlation values, and (b) cycle the non-overlapping region to either the beginning or the end of the selected time series.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Temporal windows for correlation computation</head><p>We provide users with options to restrict the temporal correlation calculations to a user specified temporal window. This feature allows users to interactively click and hold the left mouse button, and drag the mouse on the time series graph to select the temporal region between the two clicked locations. The user can then choose to perform the correlation analyses described in either of sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. The system automatically restricts the correlation analysis to the user selected temporal window. Furthermore, if the user chooses to cycle the non-overlapping temporal regions of their datasets in the correlation computation procedure, and selects a temporal window, the system replicates the selected time series within the temporal window and concatenates it to its beginning and end, thereby forming a new time series dataset. The system then uses this newly generated temporal dataset and performs the correlation analysis with the other (unaltered) userselected datasets.</p><p>We observe that this temporal windowing method is especially useful when the user is interested in determining the correlations between different datasets within a specific temporal window. This may be because certain temporal distributions may be highly correlated only within certain temporal periods (e.g., holiday periods, weekends). For example, noise complaints and drunkenness/public intoxication offenses may have a high correlation pattern within university academic semesters, and may not have significant patterns within the summer months when most students are not on-campus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">Automatic computation of correlation between different datasets</head><p>In order to assist analysts in the discovery of potential high correlation between datasets, we utilize a brute-force algorithm that applies the method described in Section 3.2.2 to all possible combinations of the user-selected datasets. We then count the total number of significant correlation values at different lead/lag values (using the t-test), and save the results in descending order of the number of significant correlation values in a text file. In addition to this text file, we also provide users the option to save the corresponding global correlation graphs obtained for all the combinations as images on their local machines for the analysts to review. This method allows analysts to easily analyze and discover the datasets that are potentially correlated to one another. We note, however, that this process acts only as a starting point for analysis and only provides a hint towards possible correlations among the datasets. An analyst who has domain knowledge of the underlying datasets remains a necessary component in this correlative visual analytics process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Correlation Exploration in Geospace</head><p>In addition to performing a temporal analysis of data, our system also provides analysts with a suite of geospatial data aggregation tools that allows them to compare the correlations between the incident distribution levels within and across selected spatial regions. This method allows users to restrict their analysis to specific regions and generate and test hypotheses pertinent to their domain knowledge of the datasets. We also allow analysts to factor in the lead/lag values obtained as a result of performing a temporal correlation analysis and visualize their datasets in geo-space by displaying the incidents at different temporal lead or lag levels. We describe both these methods in detail below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Spatial region selection</head><p>We provide analysts with the ability to spatially aggregate their datasets by either drawing arbitrary regions on the map, or by an underlying spatial boundary (e.g., census block, county). This action aggregates the incidents falling within the selected spatial regions and extracts the temporal datasets of an aggregate of all user selected data categories for these regions. This allows users to compare the incidents between multiple spatial regions and determine how closely related the selected incident distributions are to both within, and across the spatial regions. We note that this spatial region selection also enables the correlation analysis and comparison of a smaller spatial region against the entire region. For example, an analyst may choose to compare the burglary crimes of a certain neighborhood by drawing a shape around the neighborhood, and draw another boundary around the entire city, and explore how the two selected regions compare against one another.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Visualizing the incident distributions in space at selected temporal lead/lag values</head><p>In order to visually compare the incidents across multiple temporal lead/lag values in space, we allow users to interactively select a temporal lead/lag value using the global correlation graph <ref type="figure">(Figure 1 (d)</ref>). Once the lead/lag value is selected, the spatial map display <ref type="figure">(Figure 1 (a)</ref>) shows the geo-spatial distribution of the incidents of the selected category at an offset applied to the current time. This offset is given by the selected lead/lag value, and the current time is dictated by the time slider <ref type="figure">(Figure 1 (g)</ref>). The geospatial distribution of the incidents of the other selected categories, on the other hand, are shown on the map at the current time. This allows the user to visualize the spatial incident distributions of one category with respect to the other selected categories at a selected lag, and allows them to visually observe spatial patterns among the different incident categories across time to explore potential relationships and causations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CASE STUDY: EXPLORING CORRELATIONS IN CRIMINAL, TRAFFIC AND CIVIL (CTC) INCIDENT REPORT DATASETS</head><p>In this section, we demonstrate our work by applying the methods described so far to CTC incident reports from Tippecanoe County, IN, U.S.A. This dataset provides several categorical incident distributions including offense reported, entities against whom crimes are committed and agencies that respond to the incident. In addition, every incident has an associated geographic location and a time stamp. We now provide several examples that show how our correlative visual analytics system can be used and highlight some of the features of our system. We also discuss the insights that the system provides into the spatiotemporal CTC incident activity levels as a result of the analysis done using our system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Drug abuse violations vs. burglaries</head><p>In this example, we provide a hypothetical scenario where an analyst is interested in exploring the correlations among drug abuse violations and burglaries (both residential and commercial) in order to find patterns and trends among the two crimes. To begin the process, the analyst filters and selects the offenses related to drug abuse violations and burglaries using the system's interactive menu <ref type="figure">(Figure 1 (b)</ref>, and visualizes the daily incident temporal distributions of the offenses for the year 2011. The analyst now chooses to perform a correlative analysis over the entire region, and allows the system to determine the correlations between the two crimes at different temporal lead/lag values using the automatic computation method described in Section 3.2.2. Specifically, the analyst selects drug abuse violations (by clicking on its time series graph), and allows the system to compute the temporal correlations with respect to burglary crimes within a temporal lead/lag values of ±N/4 days (where N is the total temporal duration of 365 days). This action animates the main graph by moving the time series data for drug abuse violations from a lead value of −N/4 to a lag value of +N/4, and computes the correlation between the overlapping regions of the time series datasets. The results are shown in the correlation vs. lead/lag graph alongside the main graph, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> (a).</p><p>The analyst first notes that there occurs a significant negative correlation between drug abuse violations and burglaries at a lead value of -1 days between the two offenses, providing an indication that an increase in drug abuse violation arrests or reports lead to a decrease in burglaries after one day. He hypothesizes that this may be because with more drug abuse violations and arrests that follow these drug busts, there may be less criminals out in the streets to commit crimes, thereby suggesting that these criminals may be have a relationship with the burglary crimes in the county. He also notes a significant correlation when drug abuse violations lead burglary crimes by 11 and 26 days (seen by the significant correlation at a lag value of -11 and -26 days from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4 (a)</ref>). The analyst notes that these may be attributed to these drug offenders getting bailed out of jail and burglarizing a house in order to get some fast cash to satisfy their drug needs. He further observes other significant correlations at the outliers of the correlation vs. lead/lag graph. The analyst notes that these may be a consequence of the offenders serving jail time, or simply due to random chance. In this process however, he is quick to note that correlation does not imply a causation, and just because there is a strong positive or negative correlation between the two offenses, it does not imply that one offense directly causes the other. He notes that this is especially true since the offenses are aggregated over the entire county as different locations are governed by different spatial demographics and variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Temporal windowing by academic calendar</head><p>The analyst now notes that the population in Tippecanoe County fluctuates with the university academic calendar year as it is home to a large university, and investigates whether the academic calendar has an effect on drug abuse violations and burglaries in the county. As was done earlier, he repeats the automatic correlation computation analysis, but now restricts the analysis to the temporal windows of academic Spring, Summer and Fall semesters (using the technique described in Section 3.2.3). The correlation vs. lead/lag plots have been shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 4 (b-d)</ref>. He first investigates whether any of the patterns discovered between drug abuse violations and burglaries in the time analysis for the entire year hold with respect to the academic semesters, which would hint to a pattern among the offenses that could be attributed to the academic calendar. He first observes a significant negative correlation when drug abuse violations lead burglary crimes by two days (at a lead/lag value of -2 days in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> (b)) in the Spring semester. He also finds a negative correlation at a lead/lag value of -1 day (although the t-test indicates that this is not statistically significant). This pattern, however, does not hold in the Fall semester <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 4 (d)</ref>) (although a slightly non-significant negative correlation does exist at a lead/lag value of -2 days of the Fall semester). The analyst observes that the correlation vs. lead/lag graph for the summer session <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 4 (c)</ref>) shows no observable pattern as compared to the rest of the academic year, which he attributes to the fact that a majority of college students leave town during the summer months causing an economic shift in the region.</p><p>The analyst also observes that the significant positive correlation observed at a lead/lag value of -11 days in the global temporal analysis <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 4 (a)</ref>) is also observed around the same time in the Spring and Fall semesters. This provides further supporting evidence to his hypothesis that the drug offenders may be getting bailed out of jail by that time, resulting in a positive correlation value at around 11 days (thereby hinting to an increase of burglary offenses). With these results, the analyst may decide to investigate further whether there is a pattern between drug offenders getting bailed out and an increase in burglaries after a period of around 11 days in Tippecanoe county.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploring crime correlations over geospatial hotspots</head><p>The analysis done so far considers the drug abuse violations and burglaries for the entire county. However, different neighborhoods in a large spatial region have different attributes, and as such, behave differently in terms of crime patterns and trends. With this in mind, the analyst now decides to use the system and find the spatial hotspots of both drug abuse violations and burglary crimes. To achieve this, he aggregates the data first for drug violations for the year 2011, and uses our system's spatial heatmap feature to visualize the hotspots for drug violations. He interactively selects the region with the highest drug violations (region D1 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref> (left)) for the year 2011 by drawing a rectangle over it. This action lets the system automatically extract the time series plot of all drug violations for this region. Similarly, the analyst visualizes the heatmap for burglary crimes, and interactively selects the hotspot (given by region B1) in the neighborhood of the selected drug violation hotspot, thereby extracting the time series plot for all the burglary offenses for this region. He then performs the correlative analysis for these subsets of data, comparing the temporal trends of the drug abuse violation hotspot (region D1) against the neighboring burglary crime hotspot (region B1). The correlation vs. lead/lag graph resulting from this is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref> (a). The analyst observes something very unusual from these results. He finds a high significant positive correlation at a lag value of zero days between the two spatial regions, giving an indication that as drug abuse violation rates increase in the selected region, burglary rates also increase in the other neighborhood (and vice versa).</p><p>The analyst next selects the drug abuse violations for the region selected previously (region D1), and compares these to the burglary offenses for another burglary hotspot (region B2) in another city. The results of these are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref> (b). He however finds that these two regions do not share the same pattern that regions D1 and B1 do. Specifically, he finds no positive correlation at a lag of zero days, hinting to the fact that the drug abuse violations and burglary crimes do not share the same pattern across two different cities. The analyst now compares the drug abuse violations and burglary offenses for two other regions in the same neighborhood in the other city, that is, he compares the drug abuse violations for region D2 and burglary offenses for region B2. These results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref> (c). He finds that these two regions share the same pattern as regions B1 and D1. That is, there exists a significant positive correlation between these two regions at a lag of zero days. Finally, he compares the drug abuse violations for region D2 and the burglaries for region B1. The resulting correlation vs. lag/lead graph is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6 (d)</ref>. Again, as was the case with regions D1 and B2, there are no significant correlations at a lag value of zero days. These results suggest that drug abuse violations are highly correlated to burglary crimes in the same neighborhoods in Tippecanoe County at a lag of zero days, but not across different neighborhoods. He infers that this may be because the criminals lack transportation methods to travel across different cities, or that these criminals may have a tendency to target their own neighborhoods (a fact known from domain knowledge). This approach thus allows the analyst to analyze and compare the crime patterns of individual neighborhoods, and test and form hypothesis using their domain knowledge. As can be observed from this process, domain expert knowledge is a critical part in this analytical process.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Drunkenness/public intoxication vs. noise complaints</head><p>We now provide an example in which an analyst is investigating the correlations between drunkenness/public intoxication offenses and noise complaints in the cities of Lafayette and West Lafayette, Indiana. He works under the hypothesis that there exists a causal relationship between the two offenses that repeats periodically by a period of seven days. This is because drunkenness and noise complaints generally go hand in hand, and usually have higher occurrences over the weekends. To begin this analysis, the analyst first selects both these offenses and visualizes the distributions of the two offenses by a weekly temporal aggregation level to detect any significant patterns over a weekly temporal scale. He first visualizes the offenses in geospace by interactively scrolling in time using the system's time slider <ref type="figure">(Figure 1 (h)</ref>), and observes that the hotspots for the two offenses occur near the university campus and have a strong co-occurrence with the locations of the local pubs and bars. He also uses the system's calendar view and observes that the daily distributions are higher over the weekends, with most complaints occurring between Thursdays and Sundays. This is obvious to the analyst as he knows from his domain knowledge that college students tend to party over the weekends.</p><p>The analyst now applies the automatic correlation computation method (Section 3.2.2) on these two datasets with a weekly temporal aggregation scaling for the year 2011. The results from this analysis are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1 (d)</ref>. In this image, the analyst has selected drunkenness/public intoxication offenses (shown in red color). The system automatically animates and moves this time series graph from a lead value of −N/4 to a lag value of +N/4 (here, N = 52 weeks) with a step size of 1. The system computes the correlation at each lead/lag step, and displays the resulting correlation in the correlation vs. lead/lag graph <ref type="figure">(Figure 1 (d)</ref>). However, the analyst notices no significant patterns as a result of this analysis. He notes however that the problem lies with the weekly temporal aggregation level chosen. He then chooses a daily temporal scale level, and performs the same analysis for the two datasets over a period of one year. The resulting correlation vs. lead/lag graph has been shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref>. These results show a clear day-of-the-week effect between the two datasets, with the correlation (significantly) peaking after every 7 days. The dashed blue region in the graph highlights the lag value that maximizes the correlation (28 days). We note here that if the system only displayed the lag value that maximizes the correlation, the analyst would not get the insights that are provided by the visualization resulting from this visual analytics process. This further demonstrates the value of visualization and visual analytics in this analysis process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Drunkenness/public intoxication and noise complaints vs. traffic accidents</head><p>In our final example, we demonstrate our visual analytic correlation technique with a scenario in which an analyst is investigating the correlations between drunkenness/public intoxication offenses, noise complaints and traffic accidents in Tippecanoe County, IN. Using his domain knowledge, the analyst decides to compare the datasets for the spatial hotspots (as was done in the example provided in Section 4.1) for traffic accidents against drunkenness/public intoxication and noise complaints combined, and selects a temporal scaling by day for the year 2011. The correlation vs. lead/lag graph is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref> (Left), which shows a similar day-of-the-week effect as was observed in the example given in Section 4.2, with the pattern repeating every 7 days. Also, the correlation peak occurs at a lag of zero days, suggesting that drunkenness and noise complaints go hand-in-hand with traffic accidents, and are highly correlated to one another. The analyst now decides to compare drunkenness/public intoxication and noise complaints combined against traffic accidents for the two hotspot regions selected for the year of 2011. In this case however, he decides to visualize the data by hour by binning the data from Monday to Sunday, with the total bins equaling 7 × 24. By this convention, the incidents for all Mondays for the year of 2011 fall in the bin range of 0-23, the incidents occurring on Tuesdays fall in the bin range of 24-47 hours, and so on. The results of running the correlative analysis on these two time series datasets have been shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref> (Right). These results show a high positive correlation between drunkenness/public intoxication and noise complaints combined and traffic accidents within the selected regions within a lead/lag values between -5 to +4 hours, indicating that drunkenness/public intoxication, noise complaints and traffic accidents go hand-in-hand with each other within a 24 hour period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploring geospatial patterns between selected offenses</head><p>The analyst now utilizes the method described in Section 3.3.2, and chooses to visualize the geospatial distribution of drunkenness/public intoxication and noise complaints against traffic accidents at an hourly lag between -5 to 0 hours to see if a spatial pattern emerges that shows a spatial association between these offenses and traffic accidents. He observes that there occur many traffic accidents after a few hours of noise/drunkenness complaints around the neighborhoods of local pubs and bars. The analyst notes that this may indicate that more police officers should be on the lookout for traffic accidents when the rates of noise complaints and drunkenness increase around the regions of local pubs and bars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this work, we have presented a correlative analysis framework for computing spatiotemporal correlations in a visual analytics environment. We utilize the Pearson's correlation coefficient and factor in the lead or lag between different datasets for pattern and anomaly detection, thereby providing the tools for analysts and decision makers to quickly obtain the potential relationships between different datasets. We provide interactive tools that enable users to compute the correlations between multiple multivariate datasets. Our work explores the potential of visual analytics in the correlation exploration domain, and provides users with an interactive way of understanding and applying the underlying statistical algorithms at different appropriate temporal and spatial scales.</p><p>Our future work includes expanding our current work further in the spatial domain, and allowing users to interactively explore the correlations among the datasets in the spatial view. We plan on utilizing advanced statistical methods to enable users to detect spatial anomalies, that would provide a starting point in the correlative analysis process. We also plan on investigating different methods of computing and displaying correlations among multiple time series datasets at different lead/lag values (as was noted in Section 3.2.1). We note that Pearson's correlation coefficient enables a linear correlation between two variables, and we plan on investigating and incorporating non-linear correlation techniques among multivariate datasets in the future. We also note that a time series can be viewed as the sum of multiple components of variation, and can be separated into its various components using, for example, Seasonal-trend decomposition methods based on loess <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. We plan on utilizing these techniques to separate the time series into its components and then applying our methods to further reveal finer trends among the datasets. We also plan on expanding our system to enable a correlation analysis of multiple data sources (e.g., CTC incidents vs. climate and moon phase datasets). We also plan on developing natural scale templates for automatically aggregating data to appropriate spatiotemporal levels for use in the correlation analysis process. Furthermore, we plan on conducting a formal userevaluation of our system in the future to evaluate the efficiency of our system with varied amounts of data. Finally, we plan on deploying our correlative analysis framework to our public safety consortium members for further refinement and testing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Cycling the non-overlapping region of the data.
