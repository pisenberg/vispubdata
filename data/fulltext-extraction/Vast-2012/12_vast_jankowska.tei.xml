				<p>The Common N-Gram (CNG) classifier is a text classification algorithm based on the comparison of frequencies of character n-grams (strings of characters of length n) that are the most common in the considered documents and classes of documents. We present a text analytic visualization system that employs the CNG approach for text classification and uses the differences in frequency values of common n-grams in order to visually compare documents at the sub-word level. The visualization method provides both an insight into n-gram characteristics of documents or classes of documents and a visual interpretation of the workings of the CNG classifier.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>A character n-gram from a given text is a string of n consecutive characters appearing in the text. Character n-gram based methods have been successfully applied to various problems in the text mining domain. They proved to be especially effective in the field of text classification. Language recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[11]</ref> is the domain of one of the earliest, and very successful, applications of n-gram methods. Authorship attribution is another text classification problem that has been efficiently tackled by using character n-gram approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">24]</ref>.</p><p>An important advantage of the character n-gram approach is its language independence. As the model is based on character sequences, it does not rely on syntax or semantics of a language; the same algorithm can be used for text documents of various languages. Stemming and removing of stop words is usually not necessary, and even not desirable, when a character n-gram method is used. Moreover, such an analytical method can be easily applied for languages of a non-trivial word segmentation. An n-gram does not even have to be a sequence of characters; an analogous methods as for text documents can be employed for other, noncharacter based sequences, for example in biological domain for classification based on amino acid sequences or DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">34]</ref>, or in the realm of music for authorship attribution task for musical works <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[36]</ref>.</p><p>The foundation of our system is the Common N-Gram (CNG) analysis method: a text classification algorithm proposed by Kešelj et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref>. It relies on a dissimilarity measure between a document and a class that is based on the differences in the usage frequencies of the most common n-grams of the document and of the class.</p><p>We present a visualization system called Relative N-Gram Signatures that sheds light on n-grams used for the CNG analysis method. The system provides users with the ability to explore the most important (most distinguishing) n-grams for a document or for a class of documents as well as to gain insight into the inner workings of the classifier. The application employs visualization for discovery of patterns of characteristic n-grams, facilitating a visual inspection of n-grams that are characteristic for a given document or class. It also allows for a manual adaptation of the classification process via the visualization based on the task-dependant decision of a user. The system is targeted at users interested in detailed investigation of the characteristic n-grams of documents, for example the documents whose authorship is to be determined via CNG classification.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background information on the CNG classifier and a survey of the literature related to our project. The main ideas we employ in our visualization are described in Section 3, which is followed by the presentation of the system capabilities and implementation in Section 4. We describe our experiments in Section 5 and conclude the paper by outlining plans for future work in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BACKGROUND</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">CNG classifier</head><p>The Common N-Gram (CNG) classifier is at heart of our Relative N-Gram Signatures. The classifier has been proposed by Kešelj et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref> and is based on comparing the frequencies of the most common character n-grams of the considered documents.</p><p>The character n-grams are strings of n consecutive characters from a given text. For example for the text "the table" there are 6 distinct 4-grams, namely "THE_", "HE_T", "E_TA", "_TAB", "TABL", "ABLE" (here the letters are converted to the upper case and the space is replaced with the underscore, as is the convention in this paper).</p><p>The CNG algorithm deals with the task of classifying a text document, that is with the task of labelling a document with a single label from a given fixed set of labels (or, in other words, of assigning the document to one class from a fixed set of classes). The authorship attribution is an example of a classification task: given a fixed set of author names the algorithm is to label a new document with one of these names. The classifier is built based on training data consisting of documents for which the class membership is know. For each class all training documents belonging to the class are concatenated together into one class document.</p><p>For each class and for a given document to be assigned to one of the classes, the classifier builds a profile that reflects the usage frequency of the most common n-grams of a given length. A profile is built based on the frequency of each n-gram in the corresponding document normalized by the length of the document (i.e., on the number of times the given n-gram appears in the document divided by the total number of n-grams of this length). Given the parameters L being the profile's size and n being the n-grams' length, a profile is the sequence of the L most common distinct n-grams of the length n, ordered by their decreasing normalized frequency.</p><p>For a pair of profiles P 1 and P 2 of two documents, the relative difference between frequencies of a given n-gram x, as proposed IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology 2012 October 14 -19, Seattle, WA, USA 978-1-4673-4753-2/12/$31.00 ©2012 IEEE in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref>, is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">d x (P 1 , P 2 ) =   f P 1 (x) − f P 2 (x) f P 1 (x)+ f P 2 (x) 2   2 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where f P i (x) is the normalized frequency of an n-gram x in the profile P i , i = 1, 2, with the assumption that f P i (x) = 0 whenever x does not appear in the profile P i . The motivation is that rather than measuring an absolute difference in n-gram frequencies, which would give a too large weight for frequent n-grams, we measure relative difference. For example, a difference between frequencies f 1 = 0.005 and f 2 = 0.003 is the same as between f 1 = 0.00005 and f 2 = 0.00003, which is 0.25. The total dissimilarity D(P 1 , P 2 ) between the two profiles is calculated by summing the distances between the profiles over all ngrams appearing in the union of the profiles:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D(P 1 , P 2 ) = ∑ x∈(P 1 ∪P 2 ) d x (P 1 , P 2 ).<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The CNG classifier applies the k-nearest neighbour algorithm with k = 1 based on the dissimilarity measure between profiles. For a new document to be classified, the dissimilarities between the profile of the document and the profiles of the classes (i.e., of the training class documents) are calculated and the new instance is assigned to the class with the least dissimilar profile.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Related work</head><p>A visual representation of classification algorithms aims at depicting the classification model, visually representing the classification results and facilitating better user interaction with the algorithm. Such visualizations have been proposed for some specific algorithms, such as Naïve Bayes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[8]</ref>, Decision Trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[7]</ref>, or Support Vector Machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[14]</ref>, or for classes of algorithms, such as additive classifiers <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[29]</ref>, associative classifiers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref>, or classifiers with probabilistic results <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[30]</ref>.</p><p>The visualization of classification processes applied specifically to the text data poses its own specific challenges, especially due to the high dimensionality of the text representation, and has been less often reported. Nunzio <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[27]</ref> applies two-dimensional representation of a text document for probability-based classification and for visualization of text collections. Plaisant et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[28]</ref> use Naïve Bayes for the text classification task as the basis of their interactive exploratory system for analyzing literary works by users that are not specialists in the text mining domain. The Ink Blots technique, proposed by Abbasi and Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[5]</ref>, is closely related to our approach in that it combines a classification model (namely a decision tree model based on an extensive set of text features) with a visualization of a document by superimposing the visual representation of these features over the analyzed text.</p><p>Our visualization system is based on another type of classification algorithm: the Common N-gram classifier relying on frequencies of character n-grams. The CNG method was originally applied to the authorship attribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref>. The classifier has been also reported as a successful method for various other classification tasks: determination of software code's authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[18]</ref>, genome classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[34]</ref>, page genre classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[26]</ref>, determination of composers of musical works <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[36]</ref>, and recognition of computer viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Other visualizations reported in the literature that are based on the n-gram similarity of documents (or sequences) aim at identification of clusters of related sequences.</p><p>Soboroff et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[31]</ref> applied visualization for studying character n-grams as features for authorship attribution task. Their work is based on a different approach to this task: the authors apply Latent Semantic Indexing with character n-grams being the documents' terms. The authors visualize the documents by plotting their first LSI dimensions; it makes it possible to visually detect clusters of documents similar in terms of LSI components of n-gram terms.</p><p>Another type of a visualization employing character n-gram similarity of sequences is based on similarity matrices, where each column and each row corresponds to a sequence and the similarity between them is defined by means of the number of shared n-grams. This is the basis of a tool for the music visualization presented by Wolkowicz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[35]</ref>; the tool is based on a self-similarity matrix for a sequence encoding a musical piece and allows for detection of musical themes. Such an n-gram based similarity matrix is also used by Maetschke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[25]</ref> in a tool for visual comparison of sequences of biological domain (DNA, RNA, amino acid sequences), which enables users to identify clusters of related sequences.</p><p>Our system uses visualization for discovery of patterns of characteristic n-grams, which constitutes a way to visually depict and analyze text documents and their similarity.</p><p>Seasoft by Eick et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[16]</ref> is one of the important examples of text visualization and analysis systems. It depicts various statistics related to lines of text to facilitate discovery of their patterns. Compus by Fekete and Dufournaud <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[17]</ref> is a system that allows for visual analysis of various XML atributes within a text. FeatureLens by Don et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[15]</ref> integrates mining for frequent text patters with interactive visualisation for analysis of literary works.</p><p>A visual text analytic system that is probably most similar in flavour to our approach and that served as an inspiration for the way our viewer presents characteristic n-grams, is the Parallel Tag Clouds system by Collins et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[13]</ref>. The authors visualize subsets of a faceted corpus by extracting words that distinguish a given subset and plotting these words as tag clouds in a parallel fashion. Our system aims at visualizing character n-grams instead of words. The feature of our system is its presentation of characteristic n-grams of a given background (base) document with respect to several other documents (and so it facilitates the discovery of patterns of n-grams that are distinguishing with respect to all analyzed documents or only with respect to some). It also allows for perception of the value of the distance in frequency for a given n-gram for a pair of documents.</p><p>Keim and Oelke <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22]</ref> present a visualization technique called "literature fingerprinting" for investigation of how various literary analysis measures (such as the average sentence length or the vocabulary richness) vary between different parts of a text. The visualization allows for the perception of specific traits of authors that can be employed for the authorship attribution problem, and for gaining in-depth insight about characteristics of various parts of analyzed literature works. Our system is similar to this approach in the fact that it also facilitates the comparison of various text documents as a basis for authorship attribution analysis, but with an analysis based on character n-gram profiles. The different level of the visual analysis (the character n-gram level) and its relation to an underlying text classification method are the most important features differentiating our analysis method from the literature fingerprinting approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">VISUALIZING CHARACTERISTIC N-GRAMS</head><p>Our visualization of documents at the n-gram level is based on the idea of depicting the difference in the usage frequency of a given n-gram between two documents (where one of the documents may represent a class to which the other document may be assigned by a classifier). The goal of the visualization is to provide a user with an insight both into the characteristics of the documents in terms of chunks of words and into the inner workings of the CNG classifier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Single relative signature</head><p>For a pair of documents we create a structure that we call a relative signature that reflects the difference of usage frequency of the most common n-grams between the documents. A relative signature of two documents is built based on their n-gram profiles. Let P 1 and P 2 be the profiles of a given size L of two documents. Then, the relative signature is a sequence of all n-grams appearing in any of the profile, each of these n-grams coupled with the distance between the profiles with respect to the given n-gram. The n-grams are ordered as follows: first we include all the n-grams that appear in the first profile P 1 (the profile of the so-called base document, that serves as a "background" for the signature), ordered in the same way as in the first profile P 1 , which are followed by the n-grams that appear only in the second profile P 2 (i.e., they do not appear in the first profile P 1 ), with preserving order as they appear in the second profile P 2 . Thus, an n-gram with a number k ≤ L is the k-th most common n-gram in the base document, while n-grams with numbers greater than L appear only in the profile of the second document; in the latter case, the lower the number of an n-gram, the more common given n-gram is in the second document.</p><p>A visual relative n-gram signature is depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Ngrams are represented by horizontal stripes. The n-grams are ordered from bottom up. For any n-gram the distance between the profiles with respect to the given n-gram is mapped to a colour according to a bipolar colour scale. The white colour indicates that the distance is close to zero i.e., the n-gram appears in both documents with a similar frequency. The red scale is used to encode a distance if the frequency of a given n-gram is higher in the base document (document with the profile P 1 ) than in the document with the profile P 2 ; the blue scale is used if the n-gram is less frequent in the base document than in the other document. The lighter a stripe is, the smaller the distance between profiles with respect to the corresponding n-gram.</p><p>One can notice that in the top part of the signature, presenting ngrams of the number higher than L, all stripes have the same darkest blue colour corresponding to the maximum distance; this is because these are the n-grams that do not appear in the base profile (and so the distance is the same for all of them and equal to its maximum value 4). Thus the blue top part of a signature conveys the information about how many n-grams appear in the profile of the second document only. For the same reason the bottom part of a signature, presenting n-grams of the number not higher than L, contains more red stripes than blue ones; that is because all the stripes of the darkest red colour, representing the n-grams that appear in the profile of the base document only, are located in this part of the signature.</p><p>As an example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> (that shows an enlarged part of the signature from <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>, it can be observed that among the first 19 most common 3-grams of Alice's Adventures in the Wonderland by L. Carroll, the n-grams "_SH" and "IT_" (where "_" denotes a sequence of non-letter characters) are more often used in Alice's Adventures in the Wonderland than in Tarzan of the Apes by E. R. Burroughs, while the n-gram "ED_" is used more often in Tarzan of the Apes than in Alice's Adventures in the Wonderland.</p><p>A total dissimilarity between two profiles, according to Equation 2, can be calculated by stepping over all n-grams in the relative signature of these two profiles and summing the corresponding distances.</p><p>A relative signature of a document on the background of itself (or, more generally, a relative signature of two documents with identical profiles) would be completely white (as the distance between profiles with respect to any n-gram would be zero) and would have the same size as the profiles (as there would be no n-gram that appears in only one of the profiles). In such a case, the dissimilarity between the (identical) profiles would be equal to zero. In general, n-gram on demand, can be used for the exploration of the n-grams that are important for a given classification task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Series of relative signatures</head><p>The possibility of determining patterns in the n-gram structures of several documents comes from plotting several relative signatures one next to another. For example, there may be a series of relative signatures of a given document with respect to various authors, or of relative signatures of a given author with respect to various documents. Such a visualization brings forth a potential of detecting interesting patterns, as n-grams that are characteristic for a document, when compared with various classes (authors) or n-grams distinguishing a class (an author) on a background of various documents. It also allows for a visual comparison of multiple entire relative signatures in order to compare the degree of similarity between documents. That means that for any number not higher than L, the n-gram of this number is identical in every signature. The n-grams with numbers higher than L are specific to the second (not-base) document of a signature: these are n-grams that do not appear in the base profile, but appear in the profile of the second document. The relative signature of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland on the background of itself is plotted (as the second signature from the left) for reference.</p><p>Based on a series of signatures one can determine that among the five depicted books, Carroll's Through the Looking Glass has the most similar 3-gram usage statistics to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. It is also evident that some characteristic 3-grams of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland differentiate this book from all others books depicted (a pattern of red or blue stripes across all signatures), while some 3-grams distinguish this book only from a subset of the depicted novels.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RELATIVE N-GRAM SIGNATURES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">System capabilities</head><p>Our Relative N-Gram Signatures application is a visual text analytics system that enables users to draw and analyze relative n-gram signatures.</p><p>The sets of book profiles are prepared off-line. When n-grams are extracted, all letters are converted to uppercase and each sequence of non-letter characters (such as the space, punctuation marks or digits) is replaced by the underscore sign "_". Such treatment of characters-unifying n-grams that differ only in the usage of an uppercase letter as opposed to a lowercase one, or of a punctuation mark as opposed to the space-seems to be best suited for the visualization and the perception of patterns.</p><p>A user selects from a predefined set of documents the base document (that will serve as a background) and the documents to compare with the base document. The parameters of the profiles (the size L of the profiles and the length n of n-grams building each profile) are also defined by users. The selection is based on the predefined set of profiles prepared off-line; the currently available choices are L = 500 or L = 800, and n being of value 3, 4 or 5.</p><p>The set of relative signatures is prepared on-line based on the user's selection. The main view of the application is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>. A series of relative signatures is augmented by a bar graph illustrating the total dissimilarity between each document and the base document (bottom of the signature plot). The bar corresponding to the minimum dissimilarity has a distinguishing colour, which indicates to which class the base document has been assigned to by the CNG classifier.</p><p>A user can zoom into the signatures by double clicking on any signature, and zoom out by Shift double clicking. A button in the user interface allows for fast return to the default zoom level, i.e. to the level in which the entire signatures are visible. On a zoom-in level, two arrows provide the interface for browsing the signatures (moving up and down along the signatures). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref> presents an example of the bottom part of the same set of relative signatures on two different zoom levels.</p><p>The area allocated for signature plots has a fixed height. The stripe width of each n-gram is based on this height and the number of n-grams in the longest signature, with a threshold minimum stripe width allowed. In a case when such an allocation would lead to the height of the longest signature plot exceeding the height of the plot area, the n-grams are sampled for plotting (the sampling is uniform with respect to the n-gram position in a signature, and identical in each signature). The sampling changes depending on the zoom level, i.e., after sufficient zooming each n-gram is plotted in any case.</p><p>When a mouse is held over a particular n-gram, a tooltip with the n-gram string and the distance between two given profiles with respect to this n-gram appears. Moreover, a highlighting horizontal bar is visible when a mouse hovers over an n-gram. This bar helps a user to analyze the given n-gram in all signatures. Naturally, the highlighting bar appears only when one of the first L n-grams is hovered. An example of a tooltip and the highlighting bar is visible in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>.</p><p>Users may explore the context of n-grams in given documents on demand. On a mouse click on an n-gram the information about its context in both documents of the signature (the base document and the other document) is printed below the plot. The context information may be conveyed in a concordance style, that is by a list of examples of usage of the given n-gram with text fragments preceding and following the n-gram in the document (analogical to the "Key Word In Context" representation). Alternatively, the context information may be presented as a list of the most common words that contain the given n-gram, ordered according to their frequency in a document, and augmented by a bar plot illustrating this frequency. This representation provides a way to explore the link between n-grams and words; it allows for determining if there exists a meaningful pattern of words a given n-gram originates from, and what kind of pattern it is. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> presents two possible outputs a user can receive on a click on the n-gram "N_T_" in a relative signature on the background of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by L. Carroll.</p><p>Some modification of the colour scale of the plot is also available for users. The maximum of the colour scale can be either set to the maximum of the distance over the entire signatures (which is the default option) or to the maximum of the distance over the parts of the signatures that are currently visible (after zooming in). Additionally, a user may choose to depict only the n-grams with the maximum distance ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 10</ref> serves as an illustration of this option).</p><p>It is possible to search for n-grams in the visualization. A user specifies a text, which may be of the length n of the currently plotted n-grams, in which case it corresponds to a single n-gram, or may be longer. N-grams are extracted from the text and the user is provided with a list of those among them that appear in the visualized signatures. When the user selects a single n-gram from the list, the signature plots zoom into the area centred on the n-gram position and the corresponding n-gram stripes are highlighted.</p><p>Users may also modify the profile of the base document by removing n-grams that they deem to be not useful or even misleading for their analysis or classification task. This is performed by tagging on the plots the n-grams of the base document that are to be removed, and then re-running the analysis. In such a case a new profile of the base document is created: one that still has the re-   quested length L but that does not contain the tagged n-grams; in other words k tagged n-grams are removed from the base document profile, and k new n-grams, with the frequency ranks L+1, ..., L+k, are added at the end of this profile. The profiles of the other documents are not modified. This process enables users to affect the visualization in a personal way, depending on their particular interests. It also affects the document dissimilarity values, and so may modify the classifier result.</p><p>Finally, the current plot can be downloaded by a user as a file in the SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Implementation</head><p>The Relative N-Gram Signatures system is implemented as a web application.</p><p>The creation of profiles (the extraction of the most frequent n-grams and their normalized frequency values) is performed off-line. It is executed by an open-source Perl n-gram tool Text::Ngrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[23]</ref> by Vlado Kešelj (with an addition of a utf-8 support for non-ascii character n-grams).</p><p>The visualization module runs on the client side (the web browser side). It is developed using JavaScript visualization library d3.js by Bostock <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[10]</ref>. This library facilitates dynamic creation of SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic) elements that are bound with data.</p><p>Some of the user interactions trigger request to the server side. The actions that are performed on the server side are: the creation of relative signatures, the extraction of the context of an n-gram (performed by the regular expression search), the modification of the base document profile based on the user's n-gram removal, the extraction of n-grams to search for from the user provided text, and the creation of a plot file for downloading. These actions-executed by C++ and Perl programs-are called upon via AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) request and PHP.</p><p>The colour scale has been provided by ColorBrewer.org [4].</p></div>

All books are in the public domain and have been downloaded either from the Gutenberg project [1] website or (for most of the polish texts) from the Wolne Lektury project <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref> website. The only cleaning of these texts consisted of removing the parts at the beginning and/or the end of each book that relate to the above named literary projects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Authorship attribution</head><p>The testbed for our system is based on the authorship attribution task. We use for our experiments the same set of books that were used by Kešelj et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref> for the original testing of the CNG classifier. This is a set of 12 English books by nine authors; for six Carroll that is much lighter and shorter than other signatures; this book represents the class to which Alice's Adventures in Wonderland has been (correctly) assigned by the CNG classifier.</p><p>Zooming into the signatures leads to discovering interesting patterns in terms of characteristic n-grams. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref> shows a zoom-in level of the same signatures as the ones presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>.</p><p>By hovering over interesting n-grams and clicking on them for the context information, one is able to gain interesting information. The n-grams #14, #19, #20 and #21 are the n-grams that originate most frequently from the word "alice" (these are n-grams "ICE_", "_ALI", "LICE" and "ALIC", respectively). They are used much more often in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and in Through the Looking Glass (that is a sequel of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland with the same protagonist) than in any other of the analyzed books. Also characteristic for both books by Carroll are the n-grams "AID_", "SAID" and "_SAI" (originating mostly from the word "said"). These n-grams are very common in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland-as indicated by theirs position in the signatures (#13, #15, and #16, respectively)-and are used more often in the two books by Carroll than in the other books, with the maximum distance value for the books by Cleland, Irving, and Shakespeare.</p><p>The n-gram "N_T_" (#48) has its source in the constructions such as "don't", "can't", "won't", etc. It serves as a distinguishing ngram with respect to the books by Burroughs, Cleland, Haggard, Irving, and Shakespeare, but is used with a similar frequency by Bronte, Dickens and Twain (in the analyzed books). The n-gram #88 is "_VER" and is most often a chunk of the word "very"; it is used more commonly by Carroll than it is used in the other of the depicted books.</p><p>The blue stripes on the level of #128 correspond to the n-gram "_HE_". This n-gram comes from the word "he" and is used in the books by Carroll, Haggard and Shakespeare with a similar frequency, less frequently than in the other books.</p><p>It is also evident that all except for a couple of the 130 most frequent 4-grams of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland are used with a similar frequency in Through the Looking Glass. The first 4-gram of the Alice's Adventures in Wonderland profile that do not appear in the profile of its sequel is the n-gram "E_MO" (#134) that originates in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland most frequently from the words "the mock" (corresponding to the Mock Turtle, a character that appears only in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland).</p><p>It is interesting to see how n-grams related both to the writing style of an author ("N_T_", "_VER") and to the content of a book (for example, n-grams originating from the names of the characters in the novels) play their role in the decision of the CNG classifier.</p><p>Obviously, not every case provides such a clear distinction between relative signatures as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>. As an example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref> presents relative signatures of nine books by nine authors on the background of the base document of A Christmas Carol by C. Dickens. The base document is correctly assigned by the classifier to the other book by Dickens. The relative signature of A Tale of Two Cities by Dickens demonstrates the higher similarity of this book to the base document than the similarity of the other books, but the difference between this signature and the relative signature of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is not easily visually perceived.</p><p>One can notice that the visualization of relative n-gram signatures does not only serve the purpose of facilitating discovery of characteristics of a document, but it also provides visual representation of the "reasons" of a classifier decision (a visual answer to the question "Why this book has been assigned to this author?" that is easier to interpret than an answer that consists of a single numeric dissimilarity value).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Mark Twain's novels</head><p>Our other experiment uses a set of novels by Mark Twain. The inspiration for this experiment comes from the research of Keim and Oelke <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22]</ref> on the visual investigation of literary analysis measures. These authors' visualization demonstrates, among others, how much one of the novels of Mark Twain, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, stands out from the other works of the writer with respect to such literary analysis measures like function words frequency, Simpson's index, and Hapax Legomena. We pointed our Relative N-Gram Signatures at the same set 1 of nine novels by Mark Twain to examine the difference between Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and other books by Mark Twain at the level of character n-grams. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 9</ref> presents the relative signatures of nine novels by Mark Twain on the background of the base document that is a concatenation of all of these books, with the parameter n set to 5 and L set to 500. One can observe that the signature of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn with respect to this all-in-one text stands out from the other ones (its profile is most dissimilar).</p><p>In particular, there is a lot of n-grams very common in general in Mark Twain's writing (depicted in the bottom of the signatures)   that are used with quite similar frequency in all of these nine books with the exception of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. By closer examination of the signatures one can determine what these interesting n-grams are, and from which words they originate. These n-grams include, among others, "TION_" (#42) that is used much less often in Adventures of Huckleberry Finn than in all other books and that comes mostly from the words "attention", "question", "nation", "condition", "population", etc. This can possibly be interpreted as the less frequent usage of "formal" vocabulary in the book being a narrative of a 13-year old Huckleberry Finn. Other interesting examples are the n-grams "_WERE" and "WERE_" (#59, #60), that come mostly from the word "were" or the n-grams "_BEEN" and "BEEN_" (#181, #182) that have their source most frequently in the word "been"; these n-grams are used with a similar frequency in all the books with the exception of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn where they appear much less often. That suggests different grammar constructions used in the latter book. Other stylistic choices characteristic for Adventures of Huckleberry Finn seem to be indicated for example by the less frequent appearance in this particular book of the n-gram "D_NOT" (#175), originating in Mark Twain's texts mostly from the phrases "did not", "could not", "would not", or by the more frequent usage of the n-grams "_DOWN" and "DOWN_" (#172, #179) having its source mostly in the word "down", and of the n-gram "DN_T_" (#277), coming from the constructions "didn't", "couldn't", "wouldn't", "hadn't".</p><p>It is also apparent that the book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer shares some of the characteristics of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. For example only in these two books the n-grams "WHICH", "_WHIC", and "HICH_" (#116, #117, #119) that have their source most frequently in the word "which", as well as the n-gram "T_IS_" (#111) that originates usually from the words "it is", "that is" and "what is", and the n-gram "WILL_" (#216) corresponding to the word "will" are used less frequently than in the base document. On the other hand, the n-gram "_IT_S" (#332), originating mostly from the phrase "it's", is more frequent in these two books than in the other Mark Twain's novels.</p><p>While Adventures of Huckleberry Finn have evidently the most distinguishing relative signature, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Prince and the Pauper have many more characteristic ngrams than the other six books, which have rather uniform relative signatures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Authorship attribution for Polish novels</head><p>An important feature of the character n-gram approach to the text analysis is its language independence. Relative N-Gram Signatures can be pointed at documents in any language provided the text is encoded in the utf-8 (Unicode Transformation Format-8) standard. The illustrative example is our analysis of a set of books by Polish authors.  of them-a novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz (correctly assigned to this author by the classifier). It is interesting to investigate the characteristic n-grams in depth and observe how the CNG classifiers captures characteristic words regardless of the many grammatical forms they assume due to the highly inflective nature of Polish. For example, one can discover that the n-gram "ZEKŁ" (#39) is characteristic for these two analyzed novels by Henryk Sienkiewicz. By investigating the words this n-gram is originating from, one discovers many forms of the verb "rzec" (a stylistically marked verb meaning "to say", being characteristic for this writer) such as "rzekł", "rzekła", "rzekłszy" , "rzekłbyś", "rzekłem" that are various grammatical forms corresponding to different grammatical persons, moods or to a participle form of this verb. Similarly, several different inflected grammatical forms of the noun "książę" (meaning "prince") such as "książę", "księcia", "księciu" are the source of the n-gram "_KSI" (#45), characteristic for some of the analyzed books.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Subjective modification of the visualization</head><p>Users may modify the profile of the base document by subjective decision which n-grams not to include in the analysis.</p><p>We analyze an example of a difficult authorship attribution task from the Ad-hoc Authorship Attribution Competition, 2004 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[21]</ref>. Problem G of the contest presents the participants with four testing documents, each to be attributed to one of two authors (Author 01 or Author 02). For each of these authors there are three documents labelled by the author given for the purpose of training the classifier. We point our system at the classification of the testing document sample 02 from this problem, with the CNG parameters n=4 and L=500. The other documents to compare this base document with are the documents obtained by the concatenation of the given training documents by Author 01 and Author 02, respectively.</p><p>The classifier attributes the sample to Author 02, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Figure 11</ref>(a). By zooming in we can clearly see a set of very common n-grams used in the sample, that are used less often in the given works of these authors, and that originate from the word "Tarzan"  (as one can discover by exploring the context of these n-grams in the analyzed documents). One can observe that the word "Tarzan" appears in fact in all three analyzed documents, with different frequencies. By browsing the signatures further, and by exploring the context of characteristic n-grams, one is able to find other n-grams that originate from proper names, namely from the words "Clayton", "D'Arnot", and "Jane". These n-grams are visually discovered because they are used with a higher frequency in the base document. The search capability allows a user to find all 4-grams that originate from these words, and the user can check that each of them except for the 4-gram "NOT_" comes mainly from these proper names (the 4-gram "NOT_" originates primarly from the word "not" and only secondarly from "arnot").</p><p>This may lead the user to the decision of removing the     following 19 n-grams from the profile of the base document: "_TAR", "TARZ", "ARZA", "RZAN", "ZAN_", "_CLA", "CLAY", "LAYT", "AYTO", "YTON", ,"TON_", "_D_A", "D_AR", "_ARN", "ARNO", "RNOT", "_JAN", "JANE", "ANE_", as their presence and the differences in the usage frequencies are judged to be the evidence of persons that the given documents are about, not the evidence of the difference in the style of writing, which is the topic of the analysis. The removal of these n-grams from the profile of the base document means that 19 new n-grams are added to this profile (which can be thought of as, though is not equivalent to, creating a profile of 500 most common n-grams of the base document stripped of these discovered proper names). After re-running the analysis the bottom part of the signatures is cleared of some red stripes (red indicating that the n-grams are used more often in the base document) while the classification result changes: the sample document is now attributed to Author 01 (with a small difference in the dissimilarity value: 587 vs 588), as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Figure 11</ref>(b). This modified result is in fact the correct one: the test document 02 is a sample of Author 01 (the writings of Author 01 and Author 02 being respectively the early (pre-1914) and late (post-1920) writings of Edgar Rice Burrows <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[21]</ref>).</p><p>The method of modifying the profile of the base document based on a particular, task-dependent interest of a user is of a general use for visual analysis of the characteristics of documents (it can serve the purpose of removing from the visualization the elements deemed to be not useful or misleading in order to concentrate one's attention on other characteristics). As a method to modify the result of the classification algorithm it may be limited to such specific (and difficult) cases; more experiments are needed to evaluate that. This process can increase the trust of expert users in the decision of the classifier, because it allows them to eliminate at least some input to the decision from features that are in the users' opinion not relevant to the task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">FUTURE WORK</head><p>There is a number of possible additions to the current framework that can be made. The function of the distance between profiles with respect to a given n-gram that is currently used (Equation 1) is one of many that can be tested in this context (some already proposed in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[18]</ref>). It would be of interest to compare different distance functions (with the selection being available for the system users) with respect to both the correctness of the classifier (for example for the authorship attribution problem) and the effect on the visualization.</p><p>We also plan to investigate ways of improving the capability of analyzing long signatures. In the case of other distance functions it may be possible to add an "overview mode" of a visual relative signature, namely a plot of a signature with only some fixed number of the most distinguishing n-grams (the n-grams with the highest distance) depicted, which would help to analyze longer profiles. For the currently used distance formula this mode does not limit the number of depicted n-grams significantly, as all of the quite numerous n-grams that appear only in one profile bear the same, maximum value of the distance. An alternative view in which n-grams are ordered by their distance value in each signature independently is also worth exploring as a way of comparing long signatures.</p><p>Further research on the ways of selecting the n-grams for profiles is another direction worth exploring. Comparing frequencies of n-grams across documents during the stage of building a profile (by use of some statistics as χ 2 or G 2 ) is one possibility; selection of variable length n-grams is another. Yet another approach worth investigating is to differentiate between n-grams that come from different parts of speech.</p><p>We are planning to experiment with pointing our system at different data sets and classification tasks, such as for example the task and the data related to the classification of web pages according to their genre. Usage of this tool for a problem of clustering text documents is another extension worth pursuing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>We presented Relative N-Gram Signatures, a visual text analytics system based on the Common N-Gram classifier. The system enables users to gain insight into the patterns of characteristic n-grams of given documents (with a relation to a set of documents) as well as to visually analyze the classifier algorithm. It also facilitates influencing the classification process by a user based on the insight gained from the visualization. We have demonstrated how this analysis can be performed by using a set of English literary novels and with the analytical task of analyzing authorship style. The robustness and language independence of the method is demonstrated by using a set of Polish novels in a similar analysis. No specific language knowledge is used. A particular advantage of using character n-grams has been shown to be robustness in the context of a highly inflective language, such as Polish.</p><p>The presented visualization tool is made available through any web browser by using JavaScript library d3.js, and it is very platform independent and relying only on availability of a recent version of a Web browser. The interactive feature of zooming and visualizing n-gram context provides a support for drill-in based analysis of documents.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>that appear in the first (base) profile (ordered as in the first profile) base document: carroll alice's adventures in wonderland n-grams that appear in the first (base) profile (ordered as in the first profile) only in the second profile n-grams that appear (ordered as in the second profile) Figure 1: A relative signature of Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes on the background of the base document of Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, built on the profiles with the parameters L = 500 and n = 3.
