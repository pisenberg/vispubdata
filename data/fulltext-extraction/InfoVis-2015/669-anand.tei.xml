<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Understanding multidimensional data sets is a common challenge in Exploratory Data Analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Many techniques have been proposed for visualizing multidimensional data in 2D. Perhaps the two most common techniques are projective displays, such as scatterplot matrices (SPLOMs), which consist of a set of 2D projections of the data, and small multiple displays (also called collections or trellis displays) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, which show 2D slices of the data created by partitioning on one or more variables.</p><p>Unfortunately, as the number of variables in the data set grows, neither approach scales well since the number of plots that must be displayed increases quickly. This problem can be addressed by showing only the subset of "interesting" variables. However, if the user does not know a priori which variables might be of interest, finding them can be time-consuming since the user must manually iterate through all the variables to find views that help explain their data.</p><p>In the context of projective displays, there has been substantial work in automating this process. John and Paul Tukey suggested cognostics, visualization metrics that permit computers to "judge the relative interest of different displays" <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Perhaps the best known of these are scagnostics, cognostics designed to help find interesting scatter- plots in a SPLOM. However, there has been little corresponding work in the automatic selection of interesting partitioning dimensions for small multiple displays. In this paper, we address this problem.</p><p>To motivate our work, consider the scatterplot in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>(a) which shows the surprisingly complex relationship between acceptance and graduation rates at US universities <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. In <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>(b), a small multiple display partitioned on aggregate ACT scores for admits at each university helps explain this pattern. For universities with low ACT scores (in the range <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, the graduation rate is low regardless of the admission rate. For universities with mid-range ACT scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>, there is no clear correlation. And for universities with very high ACT scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>, there is a nearly linear relationship between the acceptance rate and the graduation rate. Thus, the relationship between acceptance and graduation rates is strongly mediated by admit ACT scores. Our goal is to devise a method that examines the variables in a data set and automatically recommends ones, such as the ACT score in this example, that create effective small multiple displays.</p><p>In this paper, we:</p><p>• describe a set of goodness criteria for evaluating small multiple displays,</p><p>• develop a method for measuring the quality of partitioning variables based on a randomized, non-parametric permutation test which allows us to incorporate a wide range of existing cognostics for single visualizations, while adjusting for their pattern detection sensitivities, and</p><p>• demonstrate that our method selects small multiple displays that meet our goodness criteria. We focus in this paper on small multiples based on scatterplots and use scagnostics as our cognostics, but our method could be applied to other view types by using corresponding cognostics. The next section summarizes related work on small multiples, cognostics, and non-parametric approaches in visualization. Then we describe our criteria and our method for ranking small multiple displays. We then validate our method against our criteria. We conclude with a discussion of challenges and future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PREVIOUS WORK</head><p>Our work draws on previous work in three areas of visualizationsmall multiple displays, cognostics, and the use of non-parametric statistics to improve visual analytics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Small Multiple Displays</head><p>Small multiple displays are tables of similar visualizations, where each cell visualizes a subset of the data. Such displays allow viewers to make visual inferences about the conditional impact of the partitioning variable(s). Use of small multiples dates back to the work of economist W. S. Jevons in the 19th century <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> who used them to transform tables of time series data into rich graphical displays.</p><p>Today, many popular visual analysis tools can generate small multiple displays, such as the Trellis package in S-Plus <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the ggplot2 library for the R language <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, based on Wilkinson's Grammar of Graphics <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, and the Polaris system (now Tableau) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. These systems allow users to rapidly generate small multiple displays to explore their data. Mackinlay's APT system <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and Tableau's Show Me system <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> implement heuristics for automatically laying out effective small multiple displays based on the data types and functional dependencies in a data set. These tools all require users to manually select the partitioning variables.</p><p>Small multiples can also be employed as a visual layout metaphor in user interfaces for exploring the input space of encoding parameters as in Design Galleries <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The alternating use of small multiples together with a large single view has also been used an an interaction device for data exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Cognostics</head><p>Cognostics and scagnostics were first proposed by Tukey and Tukey <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. More computationally efficient scagnostics were proposed by Wilkinson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. Other scagnostics have been developed to capture properties such as cluster separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>, class consistency and separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, or statistically-motivated measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</p><p>Cognostics have also been developed for other plot types. Many authors have suggested quality measures for parallel coordinate plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. Albuquerque et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> offer measures for radial visualizations, pixel-oriented displays, and table lenses. Schneidewind et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> propose Pixnostics, a cognostic based directly on the pixel representation of a visualization. Some measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> focus on the level of abstraction, including aggregation, clustering, and sampling in various chart types. For more information on quality measures for visualization, consult the survey by Bertini et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Some visual analytic systems leverage these measures to recommend visualizations to their users. For example, ScagExplorer <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> applies scagnostics to cluster and filter through large collections of bivariate relationships automatically. EvoGraphDice <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> uses evolutionary algorithms and a scagnostics-based fitness function to select interesting linear and non-linear 2D projections. AutoVis <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> uses scagnostics to provide users with effective summaries of their data, tuned to highlight patterns that professional statisticians would also identify. MacEachren et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> use conditional entropy to identify pairs of variables in a high-dimensional dataset that are likely to display interesting relationships. These variables are displayed in a matrix of view types. Trelliscope <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> uses scagnostics to organize and filter the large number of panels that result from using a trellis display on complex data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Non-parametric statistics in visual analytics</head><p>Graphical inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> asks viewers to judge whether a visualization of the actual dataset is visually distinguishable from random bootstrapped samples. The result is a non-parametric significance test of a visual pattern. Conversely, Menjoge <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> uses bootstrapping to generate a 95% visual confidence interval that can correctly communicate the sampling variability in a visual pattern.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHOD</head><p>Our algorithm takes three inputs from the analyst:</p><p>1. a scatterplot which the analyst wants to partition into a small multiple display, The output is a scoring of the small multiple displays produced by each partitioning variable. To motivate our algorithm, we first describe four intuitive criteria for effective small multiple displays. We then describe an algorithm that incorporates these criteria to automatically score potential partitioning variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Goodness-of-Split Criteria</head><p>We hypothesize that effective small multiple displays conform to the following four criteria:</p><p>• Visually rich: Effective small multiple displays should leverage the capabilities of the human visual system by conveying rich visual patterns. This visual richness is unlikely to be captured by the relatively simple summary statistics used in common analytic methods such as ANOVA.</p><p>• Informative: Small multiple displays should be more informative than the input visualization, allowing the analyst to deepen their understanding of the data. Small multiple displays that randomly partition the input data are not useful since they contain no more information than the original plot.</p><p>• Well-supported: For some data sets, particularly those with outliers or with a small number of data points, strong visual patterns can occur by chance. These spurious patterns are misleading; they appear informative, but are not. Good small multiple displays should convey robust patterns, guiding analysts to reliable results.</p><p>• Parsimonious: A small multiple display with many partitions can be very difficult to read and understand. All things being equal, we should favor fewer partitions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Algorithm</head><p>The key insight of this paper is that these four criteria can be achieved using a simple heuristic: select small multiple displays that have cognostic values that are unlikely to be due to chance. Using a cognostic to evaluate the small multiple displays ensures that we can find visually rich patterns. If the cognostic values are different from that of the input plot, then the small multiple is informative. If those differences are unlikely to be due to chance, then it is well-supported. And if there are redundant partitioning variables, this heuristic will lead to picking the most parsimonious.</p><p>The key challenge in our approach is determining the likelihood of a small multiple display's cognostic value. This is difficult because the underlying distribution of the cognostic score depends on both the cognostic algorithm itself and on the dataset, so we cannot evaluate the likelihood with a closed form formula. Instead, we propose computing this likelihood using a randomized permutation test <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, which is a non-parametric statistical significance test. This procedure builds an . The blue lines are outliers, indicating that they likely did not arise due to chance. Our algorithm will score the small multiple display in (b) highly.</p><p>empirical approximation of the underlying cognostic distribution by repeatedly permuting the partitioning variable randomly and computing cognostic values for these random partitions. To demonstrate how this approach works, consider <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>(a) which shows the relationship between the median value of owneroccupied houses (in thousands of US dollars) and the proportion of such houses built prior to 1940 for census tracts in the area of Boston, Massachusetts <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. We see that as the proportion of older houses increases, the median value decreases. However, the distribution is skewed and an analyst may wonder if partitioning this scatterplot by another variable in the dataset that might reveal more about this relationship. To do so, they run our algorithm using Wilkinson et al.'s Skewed scagnostic which can detect a wide range of skewed patterns in scatterplots.</p><p>For each possible partitioning variable, we need to compute how unlikely it is that the resulting Skewed values are due to chance. For example, consider the "distance to employment center" variable shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>(b). This variable produces a small multiple display with four plots, one for each quartile of the distance from the census tract to the nearest employment center. Visually we can see that the top two plots are quite skewed and this is verifed by the Skewed scagnostic which produces values of 0.864 and 0.856 for the top two plots, but only 0.676 and 0.646 for the bottom two plots. These values are indicated with blue lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2(d)</ref>.</p><p>Next, to evaluate how unlikely it is that these scores arose due to chance, we randomly permute the assignment of data points to partitions, resulting in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>(c). Visually the strong skewness of the top two plots has decreased. This indicates that the true scores are probably not just due to chance. If we randomly permute the data set 1000 times, computing the Skewed values for each permutation, we can construct the histograms shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>(d) which show the likelihood that a particular Skewed score will occur by chance for each component plot of the small multiple.</p><p>By comparing the true Skewed values (blue lines) to the random results (black histograms), we can see that the top two plots are in fact more skewed than nearly all the random permutations. Furthermore, the bottom two plots are less skewed than many random permutations. This provides strong evidence that the visual patterns seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>(b) are not just due to chance, but are rich, informative, and well-supported patterns. In this case, the small multiple display offers a visual explanation of the relationship between employment center locations to the neighborhoods in Boston-areas with older, lowervalued homes are close to employment centers while newer, highervalued homes tend to be further away.</p><p>To compare this partitioning variable to others, we have to summarize this information into a single score. We first need to summarize how unlikely each component plot is. A straightforward nonparametric way to do this would be with order statistics (a count of how many of the random Skewed values were more extreme than the true values). However, in practice we found that often the true value would lay well outside the range of the empirical random distribution. To generate useful likelihood values in these cases would require fitting an analytic distribution to the data. But we also want our approach to work with any cognostic measure, thus we have no a priori information about what analytic distribution we should use. So, instead we use Chebyshev's inequality which can give us a very conservative bound on the likelihood with only weak assumptions about the underlying distribution. This bound is inversely proportional to the standard z-score, so minimizing the likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the absolute z-score:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">|z i | = (X i µ i ) s i</formula><p>where X i is the true cognostic value of the i-th partition and µ i and s i are the mean and standard deviation of the cognostic measures over the repeated random permutations of the i-th partition. Finally, to get a score for the whole small multiple display, we use the maximum absolute z-score across all component plots:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">z = max i |z i |</formula><p>Using the maximum will result in high scores for small multiple displays that have strong, interesting patterns in at least one component plot. This worked well in our experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">VALIDATION</head><p>In this section, we demonstrate by example that our algorithm satisfies our goodness-of-split criteria for effective small multiple displays.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Visually Rich</head><p>Our first criterion is to prefer small multiple displays that have visually salient patterns. Our algorithm achieves this by using the input cognostic to measure the presence and extent of a visual pattern in the component plots of a candidate small multiple display. This approach works for arbitrary cognostic measures on any type of visualization, allowing us to create small multiple displays targeted at the interests of the analyst.</p><p>Consider <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>(a), which shows the relationship between linolenic and linoleic in the olive oils dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which includes eight chemical measurements on different specimens of olive oil produced in various regions in Italy. There are visually striking clumps and striation patterns in the data. An analyst might wonder whether these patterns can be isolated and explained by any of the other variables in the dataset.</p><p>To do so, the analyst can use our approach with Wilkinson et al.'s Striated scagnostic which detects banding of points in a scatterplot. With this cognostic, our approach ranks the Region variable as the best partitioning variable for isolating striated patterns from the six remaining variables in the data set. This is the partitioning shown in the left half of <ref type="figure">Figure 3(b)</ref>, which reveals the clean isolation of the striated pattern for olive oils from the Liguria region and the distinctive measurement structure of linoleic values for the Umbria region.</p><p>As before, the right side of <ref type="figure">Figure 3(b)</ref> shows the true Striated scores for this partitioning in blue and the randomized permutation scores in the black histogram. We can see that our algorithm has identified the striated pattern in Liguria west as being very unlikely to have arisen due to chance, leading to the top ranking for this small multiple display. Note, however, that the striation in Liguria east is not identified as being an outlier. This is because the Striated scagnostic itself fails to catch this case. Thus, the visual richness of the small multiples our approach selects depends on the quality of input cognostic, an issue we revisit in the discussion (Section 5).</p><p>The highest ranked partitioning variable changes with the choice of scagnostic. For the Boston dataset, the example in Section 3 shows the highest ranked variable ("distance to an employment center") on the Skewed scagnostic. Wilkinson et al.'s Outlying scagnostic detects the presence of shapes with a high number of outlier points. We see  <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>: The highest ranked small multiple display of the olive oils data set using the Striated scagnostic. Our algorithm detects that the striation pattern in Liguria west is very unlikely to be due to chance and recommends this small multiple display.</p><p>evidence of this in the highest ranked Outlying small multiple seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref>(a) based on the variable, "% of the population with low status". The Clumpy scagnostic detects shapes with multiple dense regions or clumps of points. The most "clumpy" small multiple display is determined by the boolean variable "close to the Chas river"     <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref>(b) -these component plots do not quite have multiple clumps, but rather, a single clump in the overall shapes. These partitioned views reveal different slices of the original view with visually salient features that align with the scagnostics selected and the analyst's task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Informative</head><p>Our second criterion is that we want small multiple displays that reveal informative structures when compared to the original view. This criterion is incorporated in our algorithm by the comparison between the true cognostic score and that of the randomized permutations. Randomly permuting the partitioning variable results in partitions that are random subsets of the data in the original plot. Visual patterns in these random subsets are likely to be similar to those in the original plot, and thus, not informative. Thus, a high absolute z-score for the true    The highest ranked small multiple display shows partitions that reveal strong opposite trends that were not seen in the original view. (c) The lowest ranked small multiple display that has more partitions with fewer points that look like random subsets of the input plot.</p><p>cognostic value is associated with a small multiple display that shows a pattern different from the original plot. An illustration of this behavior involves the Ourworld dataset of six UN statistics on world countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. We want to determine how to partition the scatterplot showing the relationship between birth rate and death rate seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 5(a)</ref> to isolate the increasing and decreas- ing trends that seem to be overlaid. So we use the Monotonic scagnostic <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> to find informative small multiples. The highest ranked small multiple is partitioned into two GDP categories, "Developed" with 30 points and "Emerging" with 27 points, as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 5</ref>(b). This partitioning reveals that GDP is a confounding covariate. While the main view shows an overall positive trend between the birth and death rates, the small multiple display shows that in developed regions there is only a strong negative relationship as expected for countries in that category. As shown by the histograms on the right, this informative display arises because the patterns in the small multiple display have true Monotonic scores, seen in blue lines, that are substantially outside the black histogram of scores for random subsets of the original plot. Therefore, the monotonic patterns are significantly different from those seen in the original plot. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 5</ref>(c) shows the lowest ranked partitioning variable which categorizes countries by its dominant religion. This variable produces twice as many partitions with less visually salient monotonicity, particularly in those determined by "Protestant" and "Marxist" countries. For those two categories, the blue lines of true Monotonic scores fall within the wide black distributions making the patterns seem more likely due to chance. The other two partitions ("Catholic" and "Islamic" countries) have true Monotonic scores that do not fall far outside the black histogram, making the whole small multiple display not as informative as the top ranked GDP small multiple.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Support</head><p>Our third criterion for good small multiple displays is that they have patterns that are well-supported by the data. This property is incorporated into our approach through the use of the z-score normalization which adjusts for the variability in the simulated null distributions of the randomized cognostic scores. If the data set is small or there are outliers in the data set, this distribution will have high variance, which will downweight the resulting z-scores.</p><p>To examine how our algorithm behaves with different amounts of support, we experiment by varying the size of the input data set. Using the US university data set discussed in the introduction and the Monotonic scagnostic, we compute the z-scores for all 19 partitioning variables in the dataset. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 6</ref> shows these rankings for different data set sizes, generated by randomly subsetting the full data set. As can  be seen, for small data sets, the scores are small and there is no clear ranking. The patterns in these small multiple displays are weaker and we correctly require more data to be confident in their ranking. As the data set grows, we become more confident in the rankings, with "ACT 75th Percentile Scores" and "Carnegie Classification" separating from the other variables. We can see the effect of the smaller number of data points in the component plots of the small multiple display produced by the binned ACT scores in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 7</ref>(a). This shows a 10% random subset (150 points) of the full dataset (1500 points). An analyst should be skeptical about the reliability of any visual pattern in these partitions with small data sizes. The simulated null distributions, seen as the black histograms, have large variance and the true scores, seen as blue overlaid lines, fall within them making it likely these visual patterns look similar to those in random subsets of the input scatterplot. The small multiple on the full dataset, seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 7</ref>(b), reveals a strong monotonic pattern in the partition determined by the 30-36 bin. The analyst should be more confident that this pattern is informative as the true scores, seen as blue lines, fall far outside the black histogram of Monotonic scores from random subsets of the input scatterplot. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Parsimonious</head><p>Our final criterion is parsimony. This criterion is indirectly included in our approach. High-cardinality variables create a large number of partitions, which are likely to have low support as the observations get distributed among more partitions. Thus, we will tend to reject such partitionings if more parsimonious options are available. We illustrate this behavior using an artificially generated dataset so we can hold the visual patterns across partitioning variables equal as far as possible. The input visualization is the bullseye pattern shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 8</ref>(a). This artificial data set includes a partitioning variable that cleanly separates the ring from the core as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 8</ref>(b). It also includes two other partitioning variables that separate the ring and core, but they further split them into two and four random partitions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Figures 8(c) and 8(d)</ref>). The separation between the core and ring are equally visible in all three variants, however the first is the most parsimonious-it shows the ring/core separation in the fewest number of component plots. To discover such partitionings of the visual pattern, we could use Wilkinson et al.'s clumpy scagnostic that has high values for scatterplots with multiple tight clumps of points. Plots of random samples of the bullseye pattern should produce a distribution of clumpy scores that are high, while the plots that split out the core and the ring will have clumpy scores that are much lower.</p><p>In the histograms, we can see that the width of the simulated null distributions increases as the number of partitions increases. Thus, the computed z-score will be highest for the first partitioning variable. The actual z-scores are 19.507, 9.274 and 5.129 for <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figures 8(b)</ref>, 8(c) and 8(d) respectively. Thus, our approach does prefer more parsimonious partitioning variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We have presented a method for selecting good partitioning variables for small multiple displays. An advantage of combining cognostics with non-parametric statistical approaches is that they can easily be extended to solve a variety of visual analytic problems. For example, we have described our algorithm in terms of a permutation test, which ignores sampling error in the data set. This is correct in many common analytic scenarios where the data set contains the entire population. If, however, the user wants to account for possible sampling error when scoring small multiple displays, they could instead use bootstrapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> to build the simulated null distributions. The structure of the approach would be unchanged.</p><p>Another natural extension of our method would be to handle continuous variables. Our method works in a straightforward manner on discrete partitioning variables. For continuous variables, discrete partitions can be created through disjoint binning techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>, or, overlapping bins (shingles) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In either case, our approach can be extended to handle binning by first permuting the continuous variable and then applying the binning algorithm to partition the data. We used the equal count binning algorithm for non-overlapping shingles in the example described in Section 3. Future work could investigate the use of this process to find interesting bins for continuous variables given a particular partitioning variable. The parameters to the binning algorithm could be varied while the partitioning variable was held constant. This would allow us to pick out the setting of bins that maximize the cognostic for that partitioning variable.</p><p>While we frame our algorithm in terms of scoring single variables, it is trivial to combine two discrete variables into a new discrete variable by crossing or nesting the levels of each variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. Doing so would allow our algorithm to consider combinations of variables. Another common use case is creating small multiples by drilling down into aggregated data. A variation of our approach could be used to detect if potentially interesting visual information would be revealed by a change in level of detail. Visualization tools could use this to recommend a drill down or roll up dimension. We could also extend our approach to consider sequences of partitionings. This could be used to develop a decision tree based exploratory data analysis interaction mechanism guided by our algorithm. At each decision level, we could apply our algorithm to select a partitioning variable given a single view of the data at that level. This would produce a small multiple display where each component plot could be further partitioned to reveal interesting structure. Considering the tree structure, each choice of a partitioning variable would be conditional on the other previously used variables, as in model selection methods.</p><p>One weakness with our approach is that we do not correct for possible correlation between the patterns in the input visualization and partitioning variables. As a result, we may redundantly choose a small multiple display that shows a pattern that was already clearly visible in the original plot. While exposing highly correlated variables can be useful, it is likely not what the user wants in an effective small multiple display. Statistical methods for variable selection, such as ridge or lasso regression, can downweight highly correlated variables. Our approach would be improved by incorporating similar behavior.</p><p>Our use of Chebyshev's inequality produces a very conservative bound on the likelihood of a cognostic. Better results might be achieved if more information is available about the underlying distribution of the cognostic. For example, Wilkinson and Wills have suggested that the distributions of their graph-theoretic scagnostics are well-modeled by a beta distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Fitting a beta distribution would capture the skew and truncation visible in some of our empirical cognostic distributions. We also suggest using the maximum absolute z-score across all component plots to score the overall small multiple display. This allows us to pick up single partitions with strong patterns. However, it may discount small multiples with weaker patterns in many or all the component plots. Averaging the z-scores across component plots might help address this, but may miss strong individual plots. Our choice of the maximum has worked well in practice, but more exploration is needed.</p><p>Both cognostics and non-parametric methods are computationally demanding. In our approach we compute the scagnostics for each partition of each variable and then for the randomly permuted partitions for each variable. For a moderate sized dataset with thousands of rows, our R implementation takes about ten seconds on average to evaluate each partitioning variable. More work on computationally efficient cognostics is needed. Also, in our work with Scagnostics, we have found that they sometimes miss very obvious visual patterns. More work is needed to develop cognostics that are robust to properties such as sample size, the amount of noise in the data set, and the location and scale of the axes.</p><p>Small multiple displays are a powerful mechanism to analyze a visual relationship conditioned on other variables. Multidimensional datasets offer a challenge due to the combinatorics in the choice of partitioning variables. In this paper, made a first step in addressing this problem by describing a method for automatically ranking the small multiple displays created by the partitioning variables in a data set. Our use of a randomized permutation test allows our method to detect and discount non-informative or spurious patterns in small multiple displays. We also described a set of goodness criteria for small multiple displays that favors fewer partitions, visually rich patterns that are well-supported by data observations and are different from the patterns seen in the unpartitioned view of the same data.</p><p>The basis of our approach-the combination of cognostics and nonparametric tests-is very general and, as we have outlined, there is much more work to be done exploring this area. We focused on scatterplots, as the primary data view, and scagnostics, as measures of visual patterns, to illustrate our method of evaluating small multiple displays. But, our method can incorporate a wide range of quality measures allowing it to be used on different visualization type and to address different analytic goals. We believe that the development of new cognostics and the application of them to visual analytics using non-parameteric approaches will provide analysts with a new generation of tools that will help them explore their data faster and more accurately.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>a scagnostic that measures the presence or absence of a visual pattern of interest to the analyst, and 3. a list of potential partitioning variables.</figDesc></figure>
