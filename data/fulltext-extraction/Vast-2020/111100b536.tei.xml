				<p>Data (b) Effectiveness Rank By Task (c) Rank-based Smoothing (d) Convolutional Smoothing (e) Frequency Domain Smoothing (f) Subsampling Fig. 1. Example of the (a) EEG Channel 10 (500 samples) dataset with (c-f) 4 classes / 12 techniques of line chart smoothing applied. (b) Our framework provides the capability to rank smoothing methods by their efficacy in visual analytics tasks. To form the rankings, the 12 smoothing examples are calibrated to have similar visual complexity. Then, 8 measures of effectiveness, described in Sect. 4.1, are calculated and ordered from best to worst. The results show that for this example, the GAUSSIAN, TOPOLOGY, and SAVITZKY-GOLAY methods are the 3 best techniques for the Retrieve Value (RV), Determine Range (DR), Characterize Distribution (CD), Cluster Trends (CT), Sort (S), and Cluster Points (CP) tasks. For the Compute Derived Value (CDV) task, CUTOFF, SAVITZKY-GOLAY, and TOPOLOGY perform best, respectively. Finally, for the Find Extrema (FE) and Find Anamolies (FA) tasks, UNIFORM subsampling, DOUGLAS-PEUCKER, and SAVITZKY-GOLAY perform best. Clearly, no single method is best for all visual analytics tasks, but for this particular data, SAVITZKY-GOLAY, being in the top 3 for all tasks, would be a reasoned choice.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>When line chart data are noisy, e.g., see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1(a)</ref>, visualization designers can turn to smoothing to reduce the visual clutter. However, there are many techniques available (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>(c-f)), and while the results they produce may look similar, each preserves different properties of the data. For example, rank-based (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>(c)) and convolutional smoothing methods (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1(d)</ref>) preserve local properties, such as local trends, while frequency-domain smoothing (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>(e)) and subsampling (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>(f)) preserve global properties, such as the most prominent peaks in the data.</p><p>To preserve some properties of the input data, each smoothing technique must also lose information, which can have a negative impact on the utility of the resulting data. To further complicate matters, the importance of the lost information can be influenced by both the data being used and the visual analytics tasks being performed. To date, the visualization community lacks a comprehensive framework for measur-ing the influence of line chart smoothing on a range of visual analytics tasks.</p><p>In this paper, we present an analytical framework for measuring the effectiveness of various smoothing techniques under 8 different low-level visual analytics tasks performed on line charts. We define a taxonomy of 4 classes of line chart smoothing and evaluate a total of 12 commonly available techniques on 80 datasets from 13 categories.</p><p>Through our analysis, we show that there is no single smoothing technique that is ideal for all visual analytics tasks. Furthermore, we show that the efficacy of each technique can vary by the datasets being analyzed. Nevertheless, we identify specific methods that consistently perform well, in particular GAUSSIAN filters and TOPOLOGY-based subsampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. In other cases, some methods are particularly well suited for specific tasks, e.g., low-pass CUTOFF filters and DOUGLAS-PEUCKER subsampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> are well suited for computing a derived value and finding extrema, respectively. Finally, we identify several methods, including the commonly used UNIFORM subsampling, which perform consistently poorly.</p><p>Visualization designers can use this framework and results of this paper to either: (1) select a smoothing technique, which is most effective in general or most effective for the tasks their users perform; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> evaluate their data to select the technique that is specifically most effective; or (3) to understand how much error is introduced as they increase the level of smoothing used in their visualizations. An interactive version of our framework is at &lt;https: //usfdatavisualization.github.io/LineSmoothDemo&gt;.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PRIOR WORK</head><p>We discuss prior work in the context of analytical tasks performed using line charts, decision-making with line charts, and line chart smoothing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Task Efficacy</head><p>Line charts, which are traditionally used to visualize time-series and continuous 1D data <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">55]</ref>, have been studied in the context of a variety of low-level visual analytics tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. A recent multi-chart experimental study found that line charts are significantly more accurate than other charts for the tasks of correlation and, to a lesser extent, finding extrema, characterizing distributions, and filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Even so, line charts are used for a wider variety of visual analytics tasks.</p><p>Comparison Tasks Early work on horizon graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> investigated their effectiveness as compared to line charts in a comparison task <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The work identified space-accuracy trade-off that could be used to optimize perception between the two. Another study compared line charts to horizon graphs and colorfields for similarity assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The study showed that deformations in the data are perceived differently depending on the visualization, and, in particular, line charts are more sensitive to changes in amplitude than position.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Tasks</head><p>Line charts are used in many forms of statistical analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Perception-based experiments that measure user's judgments concluded that line charts have low-to-medium precision on estimating correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. More generally, when considering aggregation tasks, it has been shown that line charts are effective at finding minima and maxima and determining value range while falling short on determining the average, spread, and outliers in the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. More specifically, when calculating averages, colorfields have been shown to outperform line charts <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Trend Assessment Another common task attended to with line charts is trend assessment. It has been shown that line charts are, in general, better at trend assessment than scatterplots and bar charts, particularly for nonlinear trends <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. However, when outliers are introduced into the data, the trends in their estimates begin to diverge from standard regression models <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Furthermore, when data are noisy, trends in the data are easier to identify using scatterplots <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52]</ref>.</p><p>Visual Encoding, Layout, and Interaction The visual encodings, layout, and interaction with line charts can have an impact on their efficacy. For example, color is an important visual encoding. For line charts, it has been shown that color difference varies inversely with thickness <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. In other words, to be effective, a light-colored line must be thicker than dark-colored ones. Concerning layout, the efficacy of line charts is subject to the choice of aspect ratio, which can be automatically optimized for a chart <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref>. Javed et al. evaluated the effectiveness of line charts with small multiples, horizon graphs, stacked graphs, and braided graphs for comparison, slope, and discrimination tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The results showed that techniques with separate charts performed better for data with large visual spans, while shared-space techniques were better for short spans. A more recent study showed that overlaid line charts perform better than small multiples in comparison tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Finally, adding user interaction to line charts can enhance the user experience without a loss to efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Decision-Making</head><p>Line charts have been studied in several decision-making scenarios as well. In time-sensitive application settings, the ability to accurately interpret a line chart "at a glance" is crucial. Recently, Pixel Approximate Entropy (PAE) was used as a metric for the perceptual complexity of line charts, and it was shown that increased chart PAE correlates with reduced judgment accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>Missing Data Another decision-making challenge in visualization is when data are missing; one needs to impute the missing data into the visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. An early study that looked at the problem of missing data in line charts on trend and comparison tasks found that even with missing data, user performance was high <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. One way to address missing data is to use additional visual channels, e.g., color, empty points, or error bars, which have been shown to improve analysis performance and confidence of users on average and trend finding tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p><p>Distortion Another concern for decision-making is distortion in the visualization, such as an inverted axis or a distorted aspect ratio. Such situations can demonstrate a reversal of messaging, which can lead viewers to draw false inferences and judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Another example is when missing data are misleadingly inserted into a visualization, e.g., assigned arbitrary values, user performance can go down significantly <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. To address this weakness, multi-view systems have been proposed to assist in time-series data quality checking <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Line Chart Smoothing</head><p>Smoothing line charts can be considered a form of distortion, as the data are being distorted to improve clarity. There has been prior work looking at smoothing in the signal processing community, e.g., Shao et al. compared 5 smoothing methods for vegetation classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, and image processing community, e.g., Chen and Yeh developed a quantitative evaluation for edge-preservation in image smoothing <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. To our surprise, we were unable to find any prior studies that evaluated the impact of various smoothing techniques to line charts, except for our own small-scale study that introduced a topology-based smoothing method <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Nevertheless, no comprehensive framework and evaluation, such as the one we are introducing in this paper, exists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">TAXONOMY OF LINE CHART SMOOTHING APPROACHES</head><p>We discuss 4 classes of smoothing that can be used on line charts. They can be broadly broken down into methods that consider local neighborhoods of data or global structures when determining the output. A summary of the 12 smoothing techniques analyzed in this paper can be found in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Each technique preserves some particular properties of the input through 1 or more adjustable simplification parameters. The number of available smoothing techniques is large. Therefore, this list is intended to be representative of well-known techniques, not necessarily comprehensive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Local Methods</head><p>Local methods only consider nearby data when calculating their smoothed output. Essentially, for each output data, a local neighborhood of the input data is extracted. Then, the neighborhood is processed by a filter, and the result is used as the output. , sorts the window (3rd row), and selects the median value for output (4th row). (b) The GAUSSIAN filter similarly extracts a local window (2nd row). However, the window has a convolution applied based upon a normal distribution (3rd row), which is used for output (4th row). (c) The low-pass CUTOFF filter converts data into the frequency domain (2nd row), zeros out high-frequency components (3rd row), and converts the smoothed result back into the spatial domain (4th row). (d) The DOUGLAS-PEUCKER method subsamples the input data by iteratively selecting (2nd and 3rd rows) the points with the largest error to insert into the smoothed output (4th row). All techniques are colored by type (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Rank Filters</head><p>Rank filters are nonlinear filters that, for each input point, ranks (i.e., sorts) a neighborhood window surrounding the input point. A single value is selected from the ranked set for output. The MEDIAN filter (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>(c)(left)) selects the median value from the ranked neighborhood.</p><p>The level of smoothing can be increased or decreased by enlarging or shrinking the neighborhood window, respectively. MEDIAN filters are known for being particularly good at removing salt-and-pepper noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, but if, on the other hand, those peaks represent important data, they will be lost with a MEDIAN filter.</p><p>To compute the MEDIAN filter (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2(a)</ref>), for each of n input points, a window of size w is first selected. Next, the window is sorted. Finally, the median value is selected for output. The boundary of the domain requires special consideration. Several options exist for the boundary-we chose to repeat the boundary value infinitely. In a naive implementation of the MEDIAN filter, repeated sorting operations are required, 1 per input/output point, making the overall performance O(n • w log w). The operation can be optimized by using a sliding window to achieve O(n log w) in the general case <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and O(n) in limited cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>Additional examples of rank filters include MIN filter (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>(c)(middle)) and MAX filter (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>(c)(right)), which operate similarly, except that they select the minimum and maximum value from the ranked lists, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Convolutional Filters</head><p>Convolutional filters are a stencil-based method, where for a given input point, a series of weights are applied to a neighborhood surrounding that point. To compute a convolutional filter (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2(b)</ref>), for each of n input points, a window of size w is selected. Next, the elements are multiplied by their corresponding elements from the stencil, summed, and that value is placed in the output. Similar to rank filters, the boundary of the domain requires special consideration. For consistency, we chose to repeat the boundary values infinitely. The resulting computational complexity for general convolutional filters is O(n • w).</p><p>The GAUSSIAN filter (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>(d)(left)) is commonly used in convolutional signal and image processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. It weights the input neighborhood using a normal distribution. The smoothing level is increased or decreased by adjusting the standard deviation, σ , of the distribution. The GAUSSIAN filter can be seen as a form of a low-pass filter, blurring both signal and noise from the data, producing smooth, visually appealing results. The window used for the GAUSSIAN filter is fixed using σ as a guide. In our implementation, a window size of ±4σ ensures that we capture over 99.9% of the distribution.</p><p>Another simple convolutional filter is the MEAN filter (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>(d)(right)), also known as the moving average. In this case, equal weights are applied to all elements in the window, resulting in the average being calculated. Because of the equal weighting, a sliding window can be used to improve performance to O(n) complexity.</p><p>Finally, SAVITZKY-GOLAY <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>(d)(middle)) is a convolutional filter that uses a low-degree polynomial to smooth the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Global Methods</head><p>With global methods, the entire input data is considered in the calculation of the output.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Frequency Domain Filters</head><p>Frequency domain filtering converts the scalar data into a frequency domain representation, via wavelets or Fourier transform. Once in the frequency domain, undesirable frequencies are removed, and the signal is reconstructed. We consider a low-pass CUTOFF filter (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>(e)(left) and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2(c)</ref>), which converts the input into the frequency domain using a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Highfrequency components are then zeroed out to smooth the output above a cutoff frequency. Lowering that cutoff frequency increases the level of smoothing. Finally, the output is computed by converting the frequency domain data back to the spatial domain using an inverse DFT. Much like the GAUSSIAN filter, the CUTOFF filter produces smooth, visually appealing output, in this case, only retaining the specified frequencies. However, the relationship between the frequency and spatial domains is often not intuitive, as multiple frequencies contribute to a single output. The computational complexity of the DFT and the CUTOFF filter is O(n log n).</p><p>Additional frequency domain low-pass filters we consider include the BUTTERWORTH filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>(e)(middle)) and CHEBYSHEV filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>(e)(right)). The CUTOFF filter is an idealized function that cannot be implemented in an electronic circuit, while the BUTTERWORTH and CHEBYSHEV filters can. Practically speaking, these methods differ from the CUTOFF filter in that they provide a gradual ramp-down of the cutoff frequency.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Rank O(n log w) MIN Rank O(n) MAX Rank O(n) GAUSSIAN Convolutional O(n • σ ) MEAN Convolutional O(n) SAVITZKY-GOLAY Convolutional O(n • w) CUTOFF Frequency O(n log n) BUTTERWORTH Frequency O(n log n) CHEBYSHEV Frequency O(n log n) UNIFORM Subsampling O(n + s) DOUGLAS-PEUCKER Subsampling O(s log n)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Subsampling</head><p>Subsampling approaches take the original data and select a subset of the original data points as representatives of the whole data. Simplification is increased by merely selecting fewer points. A common choice, due to its ease of implementation, UNIFORM subsampling (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>(f)(left)) selects points at regular intervals. Between selected points, interpolation is used, with linear interpolation being the most straightforward case. UNIFORM subsampling makes few guarantees about the types of features it preserves unless the input is already oversampled, in which case it retains the original signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Computationally, UNIFORM subsampling is very efficient, only O(n + s), where s is the number of samples taken from the input.</p><p>Nonuniform subsampling, in contrast to UNIFORM subsampling, selects points at irregular intervals by considering/preserving some features of the data. DOUGLAS-PEUCKER <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref> (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>(f)(middle)) is an example that establishes a priority queue of points by optimizing the L ∞ -norm of the residual error (i.e., the difference between the original and smoothed line charts). The algorithm (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2(d)</ref>) starts by selecting the boundary points of the input data (i.e., first and last points) for initialization and connects them via linear interpolation. Points are then iteratively added by selecting the input point with the largest distance from the current output and inserting it into the output. The process continues until a user-specified threshold distance is reached. The simplification is increased or decreased by modifying this threshold. The output captured by DOUGLAS-PEUCKER is reliable and predictable, in that the output will deviate no more than the specified threshold. The worst-case complexity of the algorithm is O(n 2 ), while the average complexity is O(n log n).</p><p>An additional nonuniform subsampling approach, the TOPOLOGY filter (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>(f)(right)), uses techniques from Topological Data Analysis to smooth data in a way that retains significant peaks and minimizes error <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The TOPOLOGY filter works by first identifying critical points, in the form of local minima and local maxima, and forms a hierarchical pairing (1 each, a local minimum and local maximum) between them. Pairs of critical points are then removed from the output if the difference in their value is below a given simplification threshold. Finally, monotonic regression is used to interpolate between the remaining critical points. The overall complexity of the operation is O(n + c log c), where c is the number of local minima and maxima.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FOR SMOOTH-ING EFFICACY IN LINE CHARTS</head><p>In this section, we describe our analytical framework for evaluating line chart smoothing. It consists of 3 parts: a set of effectiveness measures for line chart smoothing (see Sect. 4.1); a description of the relationship between the effectiveness measures and common visual analytics tasks (see Sect. 4.2); and a description of the methodology for comparing different line chart smoothing techniques (see Sect. 4.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Measures of Effectiveness</head><p>To better understand the quality of smoothing results produced by each smoothing technique, we consider a set of measures that compare the input data,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X = {x 0 , x 1 ,..,x i ,.</formula><p>.,x n }, and the smoothed data, Y = {y 0 , y 1 ,..,y i ,..,y n }. There is no single measure to evaluate the effectiveness of smoothing under all visual analytics tasks. Therefore, we use a series of measures, each of which relates how well the smoothing technique preserves a particular quality of the input data. For all measures, a value of 0 indicated no error, while larger positive values indicate increasing errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Total/Maximum Value Variation</head><p>The first measures consider calculating the difference between the input and the smoothed data using vector norms, which measure and sum the difference between the data at each sample location. Considering the illustration in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>(a), we apply 2 variations, the L 1 -norm and the L ∞ -norm. The L 1 -norm, 1 , also known as the least absolute deviations or least absolute errors, measures the sum of the absolute value of the difference between the input and smoothed data. In other words, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3(a)</ref>, it measures the sum of the differences in black. As a measure, it is robust, in that it is resistant to the influence of outliers. The L 1 -norm is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">1 (X,Y ) = n ∑ i=1 |x i − y i |<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The L ∞ -norm, ∞ , measures only the point of the largest difference between input and smoothed data. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3(a)</ref>, this is the point denoted by the arrow. The L ∞ -norm is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">∞ (X,Y ) = max i |x i − y i |<label>(2)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Area Preservation</head><p>In some cases, the individual deviations matter less than the total area captured under the line chart. The change in the area, δ a, is found by taking the difference between the integrals of the input and smoothed data. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3(b)</ref> illustrates the process. The change in area is the difference between the sum of all grey bars and the sum of all pink bars. The change in area is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">δ a(X,Y ) = n ∑ i=1 x i − n ∑ i=1 y i<label>(3)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Total/Maximum Peak Variation</head><p>The next measure identifies and matches the similarity of peaks, i.e., local minima and maxima, between the original and smoothed data. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3(c)</ref> shows examples of such peaks. To measure the similarity, we use techniques from Topological Data Analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. First, the local minima and maxima of the original and smoothed data are calculated and paired in a process described in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The pairs are placed into 2 sets X and Y 1 , and let η be a bijection between the two sets. The Wasserstein distance measures the total difference between all peaks, giving higher weight to those with larger differences. The 1-Wasserstein distance, W 1 , is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">W 1 (X,Y ) = inf η:X→Y ∑ x∈X x − η(x) 1<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The Bottleneck distance only measures the peaks with the maximum difference. The Bottleneck distance is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">W ∞ (X,Y ) = inf η:X→Y sup x∈X x − η(x) ∞<label>(5)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.4">Frequency Preservation</head><p>Generally speaking, a smoothed signal should maintain as much of the frequency spectrum as possible. To measure the preservation of frequencies, F , we convert the original and smoothed data into the frequency domain using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), F X and F Y , respectively. Once the DFTs are calculated, their difference is found using the L 2 -norm between them:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">F (F X , F Y ) = n ∑ k=1 F X,k − F Y,k 2 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where k is a single frequency of interest. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3(d)</ref> illustrates the frequency domain before and after smoothing. The frequency preservation would be the L 2 -norm of the difference between these 2 vectors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.5">Value-Order Preservation</head><p>In some scenarios, knowing that the relative values of data items are maintained is more important than maintaining the correct values. The value-order relationship can be measured using the correlation between the input and smoothed data. To measure the relationship between relative values, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, ρ, can be employed. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>(e)(left) illustrates the value relationship by placing points at (x i , y i ). Intuitively, the ρ measures the proximity of the points to the diagonal in grey. In order to treat ρ consistently with other measures, we modify it, such that 0 is a perfect positive correlation, and 2 is a perfect negative correlation. The modified ρ is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ρ(X,Y ) = 1 − cov(X,Y ) σ X σ Y<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The order relationship between data items can be measured using Spearman Rank Correlation, r s , which is the Pearson Correlation Coefficient of the ranked data, in other words: </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">r s (X,Y ) = ρ(rank(X), rank(Y ))<label>(8)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Low-Level Task Taxonomy for Line Charts</head><p>To determine relevant visual analytics tasks, we adapt the low-level task taxonomy of Amar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> to line charts. For each task, we provide a brief description and an example query. Finally, we relate each of these tasks to 1 or 2 of the metrics from the previous section, which is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. The Retrieve Value task is focused on finding the function value at an exact location in a given dataset/chart. For example, using <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>, "What is the stock price on Mar '15?" (answer: ∼ 4.5). The accuracy of retrieving a value is dependent upon how closely chart values match the data value, which mirrors the total/maximum value variation measures (see Sect. 4.1.1 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3(a)</ref>). Measuring the total difference between the smoothed data and the original data, in other words, the L 1 -norm (Eq. 1), provides an average case performance for the retrieve value task. By measuring the maximum difference between the smoothed and original function, in other words, the L ∞ -norm (Eq. 2), the worst case performance can be calculated. For the Determine Range task, specific criteria, e.g., a range of values, are provided for identifying data points, e.g., the dates/times that are within that range. Using <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>, an example is, "What months saw values between 3 and 4?" (answer: Oct '14, Nov '14, Feb <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">'15,</ref><ref type="bibr">Mar '15)</ref>. Accuracy in performing this task is highly dependent upon the criteria provided. Nevertheless, generally, it is important that the values of the data closely reflect those of the input data, in other words, the total/maximum value variation (see Sect. 4.1.1 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3(a)</ref>). The average case is measured using the L 1 -norm (Eq. 1). The worst case is measured using the L ∞ -norm (Eq. 2).</p><p>The Compute Derived Value task focuses on computing an aggregate, such as the average or total value of a function. For example, using <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>, "What is the average stock price from Oct '14 to Apr '15?" (answer: ∼ 3). The task accuracy is mostly dependent on how well the line chart globally (i.e., the sum of all values) matches the input data. The task essentially requires the user to visually determine an integral of the data, which is equivalent to the area preservation measure (see Sect. 4.1.2 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3(b)</ref>). The area preservation measure, δ a, provides the average case performance by measuring the difference in integrals between the original and smoothed data. <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. Example "stock price" line chart for demonstrating task queries.</p><p>The Find Extrema task is concerned with finding local minima and maxima (i.e., valleys and peaks) in the data. For example, using <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>, "What are the dates/values of all of the peaks in the data?" (answer: Nov '14/4.5, Jan '15/3, Mar '15/5). The accuracy of the task depends upon the peaks and/or valleys remaining present in the output and significant enough to be visible. The total/maximum peak variation (see Sect. 4.1.3 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3(c)</ref>) measures both the existence and significance of peaks in the data. The average case is provided by the 1-Wasserstein distance (Eq. 4), which finds the total variation in peaks between the input and smoothed data. The worst case is found using the Bottleneck distance (Eq. 5), which measures the peak of maximal variation.</p><p>The Find Anomalies task involves looking for values that do not conform to the overall trend in the data. For example, "Between Nov '14 and Feb <ref type="bibr">'15,</ref> what month, if any, does not follow the data trend?" (answer: Dec '14/Jan '15). The task of finding anomalies is similar to finding extrema, in that anomalies are generally peaks in the data, but in this case, they do not follow the trend of the data. Since the task involves identifying peaks, the average case is provided by the 1-Wasserstein distance (Eq. 4), and the worst case is found using the Bottleneck distance (Eq. 5). Interestingly, the removal of anomalies is also one of the reasons smoothing is applied to line charts. Therefore, when performing other tasks, the preservation of anomalies might be considered a negative quality.</p><p>The Characterize Distribution task involves summarizing a trend in the data. For example, using <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>, "What is the trend in the data between Nov '14 and Feb '15?" (answer: downward). Trends in the data are synonymous with the frequency domain of the data. To be effective, the frequency domain of the smoothed data should be as similar as possible to that of the input data. Therefore, the average case accuracy of this task is measurable using the frequency preservation measure (see Sect. 4.1.4 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3(d)</ref>) from Eq. 6.</p><p>The Sort task asks users to, given some criteria, rank or order the data values. An example, using <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>, would be, "What is the order of stock values for the dates Nov '14, Jan '15, and Mar '15, from lowest to highest?" (answer: Jan <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">'15,</ref><ref type="bibr">Nov '14,</ref><ref type="bibr">Mar '15)</ref>. While similar to the retrieving value task, the accuracy of this task relies both upon the relative order of values (not the exact values) of data remaining the same, and further, the difference between those relative values is reasonably discernible. The value-order preservation measures (see Sect. 4.1.5 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>(e)) provide 2 mechanisms to understand the average case performance. First, Spearman Rank Correlation (see Eq. 8) can be used to compare the relative order of all points in the original and smoothed data. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient (see Eq. 7) can be used to determine, on average, how discernible the values in the smoothed data are from one another, as compared to the input.</p><p>The Cluster task asks users to group data with similar values or trends. For example, "Group months with similar trends" (answer: see left). Depending upon the nature of the query (clustering individual points vs. clustering trends), this task depends upon both the judgment of relative values and trends in the data. Therefore, the average case performance is summarized by the frequency preservation measure (see Sect. 4.1.4 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3(d)</ref>) from Eq. 6 for clustering trends, as well as the value-order presentation measures (see Sect. 4.1.5 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3(e)</ref> Tasks Not Considered Amar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> defined additional lowlevel tasks that we found redundant or out-of-scope for this analysis. First was the filter task, which we felt was redundant with tasks such as determine range, characterize distribution, and find anomalies. The second was the correlate task, which we felt would require comparing multiple distributions for their similarity. While this task could potentially be analyzed with our framework, we only consider the effectiveness of tasks on a single line chart.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Evaluation Framework</head><p>Given the metrics and tasks described in the prior subsections, we establish our framework for comparing the efficacy of smoothing techniques. The idea is to rank the effectiveness of all smoothing techniques for given data on a specific visual analytics task.</p><p>This requires 2 things: (1) a common measure of the smoothing level (i.e., a baseline for measurement); and (2) a method for ranking the efficacy of methods, using a specific metric.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Visual Complexity as a Proxy for Smoothing Level</head><p>As noted in our taxonomy of smoothing techniques, each method provides 1 or more input parameters for adjusting the level of smoothing. However, the input parameters for each technique have little to no direct relationship to any other technique. For example, GAUSSIAN smoothing with σ = 5 samples has no analog to UNIFORM subsampling 50% of points, even though they may produce similar results. This makes the analytical comparison of techniques difficult.</p><p>Recently, approximate entropy (ApEx) was shown to be a high quality proxy for the visual complexity of line charts <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Generally speaking, approximate entropy is a measure that quantifies predictability of fluctuations in the data. In our case, we see visual complexity and smoothing level as synonymous-therefore, ApEx is used as a baseline for our analysis. In other words, if the smoothed outputs of 2 different techniques have the same ApEx, we consider their smoothing level identical, e.g., in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, all methods have similar ApEx values. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> for a description of how to compute ApEx.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Ranking the Effectiveness of Smoothing</head><p>To select the most effective technique for a given metric, we want to focus on those that have the smallest value.</p><p>Ranking a Single Smoothing Level When smoothing results have equivalent ApEx, ranking their effectiveness is fairly trivial. For a given metric, the techniques are simply ordered from lowest (best) to highest (worst). For example, in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1(b)</ref>, the L 1 -norm, 1 , in the first column, shows that TOPOLOGY has the lowest error, followed by GAUSSIAN and SAVITZKY-GOLAY. The rankings can be computed for all metrics, and the smoothing techniques evaluated for all tasks. For example, in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1(b)</ref>, SAVITZKY-GOLAY is in the top 3 for all metrics/tasks, making it a reasonable choice to represent the input data.</p><p>Ranking All Smoothing Levels Summarizing the performance of different smoothing techniques across all smoothing levels requires additional analysis. We calculate 100 different smoothing levels, across a range of entropy values. For each metric, we create an entropy plot, which is a scatterplot of the metric value against a range of ApEx values. In <ref type="figure">Fig. 5(a)</ref>, the L 1 -norm is plotted vertically, against the ApEx horizontally for TOPOLOGY, in red, and CHEBYSHEV, in purple. Next, both linear and logarithmic regression are performed using iterative reweighted least-squares (IRLS) 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The model, linear or logarithmic, with the larger R 2 value is selected as a proxy for the efficacy of the technique. For <ref type="figure">Fig. 5(b)</ref>, TOPOLOGY is best modeled logarithmically, and CHEBYSHEV is best modeled linearly.</p><p>Since the goal is again to minimize the error induced in the data, the total area under the regression is computed (i.e., mathematical integration), and the methods are ranked smallest to largest area. In <ref type="figure">Fig. 5(c)</ref>, the total area is ∼ 2500 for TOPOLOGY and ∼ 4350 for CHEBYSHEV, making TOPOLOGY more effective than CHEBYSHEV.</p><p>The resulting ranks are placed into a rank plot, as seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>. In this plot, the L 1 -norm is ranked across multiple datasets. Each dataset receives a column, and the smoothing methods are ranked from best (top) to worst (bottom). The tracks are added to improve readability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ranking Across Multiple Datasets</head><p>To summarize the overall efficacy of techniques across multiple datasets, an average rank is calculated. The average rank simply takes the sum of the rank across all datasets and orders them from best (top) to worst (bottom). In <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>, the average rank is the final column. The average rank of TOPOLOGY is 4+2+2+1+1+1 6 = 1.8, while the GAUSSIAN is 2.0, SAVITZKY-GOLAY is 3.5, etc. <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>. Rank plot of the L 1 -norm for all EEG (500 samples) datasets. Each column ranks the techniques, from best (top) to worst (bottom), on a different dataset, with the average rank in the final column. The result shows that for this data, on average, TOPOLOGY, GAUSSIAN, and SAVITZKY-GOLAY are the most effective techniques, respectively.</p></div>

Still among those datasets, there is a distinction between results depending upon the dataset category. For example, TOPOLOGY excelled at data that are predominated by "spiky" features, e.g., climate prcp and stock volume. On the other hand, GAUSSIAN and SAVITZKY-GOLAY performed better on data with long-term trends, e.g., stock price, and cyclical behaviors, e.g., climate tmax.

Examining the entropy plots (not shown), it can be observed that TOPOLOGY performs similarly well on most of the data sets. Finally, the convolutional methods, GAUSSIAN, MEAN, and SAVITZKY-GOLAY, occasionally performed well. Among the worst performing techniques are all rank-based techniques, frequency domain-based techniques, excluding CUTOFF, and subsampling techniques, excluding TOPOLOGY. <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>.

Since the subsampling techniques, including UNIFORM, use a subset of the original data, it is safe to assume that for some levels of smoothing, peaks will be included in the output. Among the techniques that performed poorly were once again rank-based, frequency domain-based, and convolutional techniques, excluding GAUSSIAN. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.4">Characterize Distribution / Cluster: Trends</head><p>The results for the Characterize Distribution and Cluster: Trends task, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 11</ref>, show that depending upon the datasets, GAUSSIAN, TOPOLOGY, or SAVITZKY-GOLAY produce the best results, with TOPOLOGY working best on "spiky" datasets and convolutional techniques working better on those datasets with long-term trends and cyclical behaviors.

Once again, the TOPOLOGY method appears to work best on "spiky" datasets, while  the convolutional methods worked better on data with long-term trends or cyclical behaviors. The worst performing techniques for these tasks are largely the same as for other tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DISCUSSION: SMOOTHING RECOMMENDATIONS</head><p>Given our evaluation in Sect. 5, we summarize the efficacy of the techniques tested in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. For these grades, we measure the frequency of a method being ranked in the top 3 for a given task across each of the 80 datasets. Grades are assigned using that frequency: A: &gt; 75%; B: 50% − 75%; C: 25% − 50%; D: 5% − 25%. In other words, a method scoring a grade of A ranks 1st, 2nd, or 3rd in at least 75% of datasets.</p><p>General Recommendation If designing a visualization without particular concern for the data or visual analytics task, GAUSSIAN and TOPOLOGY performed well in all categories. The main difference between the 2 is that while GAUSSIAN had more A's, TOPOLOGY has no score lower than B. The heart of which to pick really lies in the type of data being visualized. As we pointed out in our evaluation, TOPOLOGY tended to do better on data with "spiky" features, while GAUSSIAN did better with cyclical behaviors or long-term trends.</p><p>Task Specific Recommendations If the visual analytics tasks are known ahead of time, a more nuanced decision can be made about what method to use. While GAUSSIAN and TOPOLOGY did well on most tasks, CUTOFF and DOUGLAS-PEUCKER performed the best on Compute Derived Value and Find Extrema/Anomalies, respectively. Data Specific Recommendations If the data are available ahead of time, analyzing them with our framework to select the best smoothing method is recommended. In addition to GAUSSIAN and TOPOLOGY, <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Grades for the efficacy of different smoothing methods are calculated by the frequency of being ranked in the top 3 for all 80 datasets. A: &gt; 75%; B: 50% − 75%; C: 25% − 50%; D: 5% − 25% R e tr ie v e V a lu e D e te r m in e R a n g e C o m p u te D e r iv e d V a Methods to Largely Avoid Several methods performed poorly across the board. These include MIN, MAX, BUTTERWORTH, CHEBY-SHEV, and UNIFORM subsampling. These methods rarely performed in the top 3. They should only be used when there is a very specific reason to do so, which should not be a problem as most of these techniques are rarely used anyways. However, this finding is particularly relevant for UNIFORM subsampling, as it is essentially the default methodology used for data reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Conclusions</head><p>In conclusion, we have presented and demonstrated a framework for evaluating line chart smoothing in the context of the visual analytics tasks being performed. There remain several study limitations and future works.</p><p>Perceptual Effects and User-based Validation Our study considers only the effects of data modification in the evaluation of smoothing effectiveness. There may be additional perceptual effects that make the results of some techniques better or worse than others. We considered performing a user study to validate our framework further. However, it became quickly apparent that the scale of such a study would be impractical. As an example, testing 12 smoothing techniques, across 8 tasks, 80 datasets, and 20 different smoothing levels would require in excess of 150k experimental stimuli.</p><p>Feature Types and Representing Lost Information Throughout our analysis, we discussed "spiky", cyclical, and long-term trends in data. These categories are ill-defined, and a broader study of feature types that appear in line charts would be valuable to the community. Furthermore, smoothing removes information from the representation of the line chart, introducing uncertainty. One additional direction of future work would be to use this framework to model and represent the uncertainty while considering the context of the visual analytics task.</p><p>There's No Accounting for Taste Aesthetics play an important role in visualization design. Without a good aesthetic, users are less likely to remember what they see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Although TOPOLOGY and GAUS-SIAN were largely the most effective techniques, their aesthetics are quite different, "spiky" for TOPOLOGY and smooth for GAUSSIAN. Our framework completely ignores aesthetic in its recommendation, in part because aesthetic is both art and science, thus difficult to model mathematically or algorithmically.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>(a) Rank Filter: MEDIAN (b) Convolutional Filter: GAUSSIAN (c) Frequency Domain: CUTOFF filter (d) Subsampling: DOUGLAS-PEUCKER Illustration of (a-b) local and (c-d) global smoothing methods for line charts.
