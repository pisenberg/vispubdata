<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Nowadays there are more and more data streams in our lives: messages are posted on social media; series of news stories are presented on the Internet; events and actions occurring in sports competitions and games are tracked; people record and share their travel diaries; and many others. These data streams usually involve multiple items, e.g.</p><p>• S. <ref type="bibr">Chen</ref>  keywords, types of actions or events, participants of activities, or visited places. In exploring these data, one may be interested not only to see patterns of item involvement (what items, when, and how much) within individual streams but also to compare the patterns between data streams. For example, during a presidential election campaign, people may wish to see the differences between the candidates' agendas and ideas concerning multiple issues and explore how these evolved over time, as reflected in the streams of the candidates' social media messages. Thus, techniques are required for supporting comparison of such multi-item data streams.</p><p>Comparison is a general and important task for many analysis scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Our research goal is to provide a general solution supporting pair-wise comparison of multi-item data streams in terms of the involvement of different items along time. The research challenge is two-fold. First, each data stream by itself is a complex dynamic phenomenon involving diverse items, and it is thus not easy to compare two such streams. Second, it is not obvious how to generate an informative visual summary for the comparison that conveys the similarities and differences of the dynamic patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ite m1</head><p>Ite To address the above challenges, we propose Co-Bridges, a visualisation technique for pair-wise visual connection and comparison of multi-item data streams ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>). We base on a river-and-bridge metaphor in the visualisation design. The river metaphor is quite often adopted for representing data streams <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. We take this popular metaphor but adapt it to the need of supporting stream comparison. In Co-Bridges, each of the two river sides represents one data stream. We choose to show the river flow along the vertical display dimension; hence, the time or sequence is encoded by the vertical axis. The vertical layout allows several river instances to be juxtaposed in a display. The items occurring in the streams under comparison are shown on the bridges connecting corresponding parts of the river sides, i.e., parts of the streams having the same positions along the time or in the sequence. The design is aimed to provide a quick visual summary of the frequently occurring items, their relative frequencies, and the qualitative and quantitative changes over time.</p><p>To further support the exploration process, we provide interactive techniques for attribute-based selection of sub-streams for focused comparisons and enable the exploratory operation "Comparison of Comparisons" by juxtaposing several instances of Co-Bridges connecting and comparing different sub-streams. These techniques allow performing sophisticated analytical workflows.</p><p>Our paper describes the following research contributions:</p><p>• A new visualisation metaphor for pair-wise visual comparison. Co-Bridges supports both qualitative and quantitative comparisons of general multi-item data streams. • Interaction techniques for sub-stream selection and exploratory operation Comparison-of-Comparisons. The user can select sub-streams according to different criteria and compare dynamic similarity-difference patterns between different sub-stream pairs. • Generalizability to different applications. We tested the design in case studies and conducted a formal user study with two applications: social media text streams and events of a football game. Our studies showed that the design of Co-Bridges is general and easy to use for comparison tasks.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the related work. We define the comparison elements, challenges, and strategy overview in Section 3. We present the design of Co-Bridges in Section 4 and the suggested visual comparison workflow in Section 5. We present two data analysis cases in Section 6 and a user study in Section 7. Finally, we discuss the limitations and the generalizability of the proposed approach and conclude in Section 8.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Data Stream Visual Analytics</head><p>Various domains are generating multi-item data streams <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>. Social media visual analytics is one of the spotlight field analyzing data streams <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. Analysis of dynamic text streams may focus on topics and sentiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref> or event evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. Diakopoulos et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> used multiple word clouds along the time to visualize how events were reflected in social media. Textflow visualized evolving topics in social media with a visual metaphor of a river <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Leadline summarized the event definition as "Topic, Time, People, Location" and visualized the events with multiple timeline streams <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Researchers further focused on the dynamic relationship between topics, including topic competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> and topic cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>; the river metaphor was also used in these works. These approaches didn't explicitly focus on stream comparison tasks. OpinionFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> addressed comparison tasks, but the primary focus was on revealing opinion propagation among groups of social media users rather than considering similarities and differences between streams.</p><p>Besides social media, much research has been devoted to analyzing various data streams including event sequences, such as gene sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, web clickstream sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, medical record sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, etc. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and Guo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> focused on generating visual summaries of event sequences. Gotz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> deal with high-dimensional event sequences using aggregation.</p><p>Comparison is a general task being implicitly or explicitly involved in many data stream analyses. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior works address the task of pair-wise visual comparison of data streams. Supporting such comparison can be useful for various applications,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Visual Metaphors in Visual Analytics</head><p>A good visual metaphor can help analysts to explore and interpret information. General design guidelines and tools are described by Borgo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. PeopleGarden uses the metaphors of a flower and a garden to encode people's profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Yi et al. proposed Dust &amp; magnet, using a magnet metaphor to encode attribute and dust encodes the data to visualize the high-dimensional data <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. In Whisper, the sunflower metaphor is used to visualize information spreading among different regions of the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. SentenTree provides a new perspective to understand the relationship among keywords and their context in the sentence and visualize the structure with the tree metaphor <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. In the following, we discuss the metaphors that related the most to our design, including the river and map metaphors.</p><p>Due to the association between the flow of a river and the flow of time, the river metaphor is widely used for different analysis scenarios involving dynamic phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. Tiara visualized the text cloud in multiple layers of a theme river-like visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. RankExplorer developed glyphs indicating the change of ranking in the river metaphor <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Other river-like visualizations can indicate branching patterns of topic evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> or lead-lag patterns of topics <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Some other designs extend the river metaphor. Episogram visualized the social interactions as curved glyphs along the time <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. SocialHelix visualized the divergences and how they evolved among different social groups with a DNA-like design <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Semantic Space Time Cube visualized the spatial-temporal and topic variation with river and card designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>Another representative series of visual metaphors is map-like visual designs. GMap visualizes clusters and graphs in the form of a cartographic map <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Chen et al. proposed a series of map-like visualization, including D-Map <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, E-Map <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and R-Map <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> for exploring contents of social media. The idea of the map-like visualization is using a familiar concept as a metaphor helping users to explore complex data, e.g. texts or other multi-item data.</p><p>Inspired by both river-like metaphors showing dynamic features and map-like metaphors focusing on the spatial arrangement, we design a new visual metaphor for visual comparison called Co-Bridges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Visual Comparison</head><p>One of the important analysis tasks to be supported by visualization is comparison. Gleicher et al. summarized three main approaches to enabling visual comparison: juxtaposition, superposition, and explicit encoding of relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. For example, genomics sequences were visualized side by side using juxtaposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Hexagon maps were superposed as information layers in a common display space <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Mauve used explicit encoding by linking to correlate the conservative parts of the genomics sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. There were many works in visualization on supporting visual comparison of different kinds of information, including tree structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>, spatio-temporal data <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>, sequences and time-series <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>, images <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, models <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>, etc. Von Landesberger summarized the research challenges for visual comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Researchers from the perception and psychology domain also conducted studies of perceptual aspects of visual comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. A tool called Duet was developed to enable data analysis novices easily conduct pair-wise comparisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. By investigating many comparison examples, Gleicher summarized the design considerations for visual comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, which guided us in our work.</p><p>Visual comparison of texts is one of the application scenarios related to our research. Text comparison is mostly supported by means of juxtaposition. It was applied, for example, to the results of word embedding <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and multiple word clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Parallel tag clouds combine the techniques of the word cloud and parallel coordinates to support the comparison of keyword usage in multiple documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Wang et al. proposed several glyph designs supporting the comparison of online reviews for companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Alexander and Gleicher proposed a visual comparison method for topic models <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. They allowed analysts to interactively align details of topic models. OCTVis used explicit linking encoding to compare the ontology of different models <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Different from previous works, we propose a design for visual comparison based on a new metaphor that can be used for comparing multi-item data streams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">OVERVIEW</head><p>We follow the design consideration proposed by Gleicher <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> to frame our research. We discuss the comparison elements, comparison challenges, comparison strategies, and comparison designs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Comparison Elements</head><p>Comparison is an analysis with more than one target <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Our target data type is general data streams containing multiple different items. A data stream is an ordered collection of data records in which each record refers to a time moment or a position (step) in a sequence. In our research, we consider data streams in which data records include or refer to multiple different items (entities of any nature), denoted by their labels. Apart from the temporal or sequential references and labeled items, data in the streams may include other components. We shall refer to them as attributes.</p><p>The goal of analysis in our research is to compare two data streams in terms of the items appearing in the data over time or along the sequence. The comparison concerns the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the item appearance, that is, the item identities and the frequencies of their appearance or degrees of their involvement. As the amounts of information in the full streams may be too large, users should be able to select sub-streams for detailed comparison. A sub-stream is an ordered subset of records from a stream. Sub-streams can be selected based on different attributes available in the stream data.</p><p>We give two examples to illustrate the concepts and show the possible stream comparison tasks. In social media, the comparison target can be text streams, such as a series of tweets, produced by different users. The items in these streams are meaningful keywords used in the texts. One can select different sub-streams of these streams for comparison based on attributes of the data, such as text topic, or location from which the messages were posted, or the time of the day when the texts were produced. For example, one may select tweets discussing the issue "healthcare", see what significant keywords were used in the discussion, and compare the usage of these keywords by different people. Another data example is a sequence of events happening in a ball game conducted by two teams of players. The comparison target is the sequences of the actions and events that happened under the ball possession by the two teams. The items are the players, the actions performed by them, and events like goal or foul.</p><p>The comparison tasks can be summarized as follows:</p><p>• Comparison of data stream dynamics: Compare the temporal or sequential patterns of data streams, focusing on the (T1) numerical trends at (T2) different levels of granularity. • Comparison of items: Provide (T3) qualitative comparison (common or distinct) and (T4) quantitative comparison (relative frequencies, absolute amounts, etc.) of the items in the streams. • Comparison of comparisons: Compare overall similaritydifference patterns and numeric trends of different pairs of substreams (T5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Comparison Challenges</head><p>The streams may be large (include many data records) and complex (include many data items). Currently, there is a lack of an intuitive approach to the comparison of such data and a suitable method of creating a visual summary for general multi-item data streams. The challenges can be summarized as:</p><p>• C1: High cardinality of the item set, such that a comprehensive view of complete streams is hardly possible. • C2: Dynamic character of the data regarding the stream volumes, the presence of different items, and their frequencies or amounts. • C3: Comparison of sub-stream pairs, which requires a compact representation of the similarities and differences and their dynamics in each pair.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Comparison Strategy</head><p>A comparison strategy summarizes how we intend to support users in comparing data streams. For creating an appropriate design, we need to envisage how users would possibly conduct the comparison. We assume that users will apply the following strategies for dealing with the comparison challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>:</p><p>• S1: Scan sequentially and drill down. According to the dynamic and sequential nature of the data streams, users will compare items while scanning the streams sequentially. Users can drill down to a time range of interest for a more detailed comparison. • S2: Iteratively select subsets based on attributes. Users select data subsets for comparison based on various attributes. The data in the subsets are ordered in the same manner as in the whole streams and can thus be seen as sub-streams and visualised in the same way as the original streams. • S3: Gain an overview of comparison. Users obtain an abstracted visual summary of dynamic similarity-difference patterns of a pair of data streams. Summaries for different sub-stream pairs can be compared.</p><p>Our design should enable the foreseen comparison tasks and support the users' strategies in addressing the challenges. We describe our visualisation design in the following section. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> presents the main idea of our design. An implementation of this design for supporting comparison of social media text streams is used for illustration ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3b</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CO-BRIDGES: VISUALISATION DESIGN</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Design Rationale: Why Bridge?</head><p>Combining the river and bridge visual metaphors, Co-Bridges is a design including multiple connecting bridges for visual comparison of two multi-item data streams associated with two sides of a river.</p><p>River metaphor. Our design builds on the Theme River metaphor <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>, which presents a single multi-item stream. This metaphor gained high popularity and is considered successful. However, it has not been designed for explicit pair-wise comparison. We extend this idea to supporting comparison of two streams. We maintain the basic concept and appearance of a river but use the river sides to refer to two streams. The shapes of the river sides encode the evolution of numeric features of the data streams, e.g., stream volumes.</p><p>Bridge metaphor. We need to make connections between corresponding parts of the two streams for presenting their similarities and differences regarding the items involved. For this purpose, we introduce the metaphor of bridges, which fits naturally to the river metaphor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Comparison Design</head><p>The design includes two main components: a river and bridges. Two distinct colors are assigned to indicate the two data streams and their items. The two sides of the river are line charts showing the evolution of a numeric characteristic, such as the volume, of the two data streams. Between the river sides, there are multiple bridges connecting the corresponding parts, according to the time or sequential steps, of the two data streams. The bridge interior is used to visualize items from two data streams aggregated over the respective time or sub-sequence of steps. The bridge interior is divided into blocks representing different items. The size of an item block encodes the frequency of the appearance of this item, the degree of item involvement in each stream, or other numeric information concerning the item. To simplify the description, we shall mainly refer to item frequencies. Each item block has two color regions, encoding the item frequencies in the corresponding stream. The order in which the items are put on a bridge is calculated based on T isa − T isb , where T is is the frequency of the item i in the data stream sa or sb in the selected period. Such ordering puts items that are more prominent in one of the data streams nearer to the corresponding side of the river. For equal values, secondary ordering is based on times of their appearance in the data streams. Thus, to enable assessment of frequency differences (C2), 3 visual variables are used: position (order), color and size.</p><p>The width of a bridge (in the 2D visualization, refers to the vertical length of a bridge) encodes the accumulated frequency of the items. On a bridge, depending on its width, there can be one or multiple lanes of items. Items can be separated into different lanes based on selected attributes, or the lanes can be used for showing more items without occlusions. There is a bar in the corner of each side of the bridge, which can be customized for showing value statistics of some numeric attributes for the period the bridge corresponds to. The time or sequence length is equally distributed among the bridges, but each bridge has a different width proportional to the combined stream volumes. To mark the exact time range, there are two gray curved lines linking the bridge sides to the accurate temporal or sequential positions on the river banks, The appearance of these visual elements fits the bridge metaphor. The two sides of the trapezoid of the bridge imitate the shape of the river banks, thus depicting local trends, increase or decrease. We summarize how our Co-Bridges design supports the comparison tasks.</p><p>• River sides: Visualizing and comparing numeric dynamic features of two streams. The line plots making the river sides represent the evolution of a quantitative aspect of the data streams (T1). Multiple-level zooming along the banks enables comparisons at multiple levels of granularity (T2).</p><p>• Bridges: Visualizing and comparing multi-item features.</p><p>-Qualitative comparison of the presence of items in the two streams is supported by showing the item labels (T3). -Quantitative comparison is supported by employing the sizes and positions of the item blocks, the heights of the curves, and the height of the bars on the bridges (T4).</p><p>• Visual summary: To support the comparison of comparisons, several Co-Bridges are laid out side by side as small multiple displays (T5) ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).</p><p>In the social media example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 3b</ref>), we processed 3,416 tweets from Hillary Clinton (indicated by pink) and Donald Trump (blue) in the 2016 presidential election in the USA. Each bridge corresponds to one week. We have selected the sub-streams containing tweets including the keyword "great". The visualization shows the contextual keywords (items) used in the texts. The line plots (river sides) show the amounts of the tweets mentioning "great". On most bridges, the keyword "great" is laid out at the Trump's side, which indicates that Trump used this word more often than Clinton. The width of the bridge near Jul.24 indicates that more tweets concerning "great" were posted in that week. We set the heights of the black bars on the bridges to show the counts of the followers who liked the tweets in the corresponding periods. We can see that Trump's tweets got more "likes".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Parameter Setting</head><p>In our Co-Bridges design, four main parameters affect the visual appearance and possibilities for comparison.</p><p>Granularity of time. Users can customize the granularity based on the defined tasks (e.g. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 7</ref> -daily). We propose an automatic granularity setting method based on an empirical parameter of how many bridges are shown at the same time. This parameter affects the overall visual appearance and the expressiveness of each bridge. We found 5 − 25 bridges to be a good default setting. In our evaluation study, we tested two examples with the number of bridges 9 and 20, and both worked well. Were there too many bridges, the details on each bridge could not be clearly shown. With too few bridges, too many items would be aggregated. Thus, we choose the granularity of time that gives a moderate number of bridges.</p><p>Number of extracted items. Due to space restriction, it is not possible to show hundreds or thousands of items at the same time. We let Co-Bridges show the items with top frequencies, assuming that such items are more important than others. The frequency threshold needs to be adapted to the specific properties of available data. Thus, in the social media example, we show the top 10% of the items according to their frequencies.</p><p>The number of visible labels. Each item has a descriptive label: keyword, action name, entity name, event category, etc. Showing too many labels will result in visual clutter and occlusions, which will hinder the user's perception. We, therefore, determine the space available for the label in each item block on a bridge and show the label when the space in this block, possibly, combined with unused spaces in the neighbouring blocks, is sufficient. The labels that would overlap with others are hidden. More labels are displayed when a bridge is wider and thus provides more space. In this case, the labels are put in different vertical positions.</p><p>Selection of colors. We select colors with a strong contrast to ensure that data items are visually distinguishable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Design Alternatives</head><p>In the process of designing CO-Bridges, we propose several design alternatives for identify the design trade-offs. One choice is a "side-byside themerivers", which may not optimal for comparing items in two rivers. Thus, we build up the structure of two histogram lines in two sides for comparison. We consider design alternatives in two levels: the overall layout and the item-wise comparison. <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. An alternative for the overall layout. The positions along the X-axis correspond to items, and the Y-axis represents time.</p><p>Overall layout. In our alternative design, the line plots are put on the sides, so that the space in the middle can be utilized for item comparison <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>). The vertical axis represents time, and the items are laid out along the horizontal dimension in the same way as in Co-Bridges, based on the accumulated differences between the item frequencies in the two streams. The items are represented by segmented vertical bars, such that the heights of the segments are proportional to the frequencies of the item appearance in the respective streams.</p><p>There are the following differences of the alternative design from the Co-Bridges: 1) The items are laid out globally while Co-Bridges layout the items locally, i.e., on each bridge independently. 2) In the design alternative, the items can be easier compared among different time periods, but the efficiency of the space usage is low. The visual marks (i.e., the bars) representing the items become too small to discern and to compare the item frequencies in the streams.</p><p>We performed a user evaluation for comparing the effectiveness of this design to that of Co-Bridges. The study is described in Section 7. Our evaluation results indicate that, generally, Co-Bridges is more effective than the alternative for comparison tasks. Item-wise comparison. In an item block, the two color sections corresponding to the two data streams can be put together in different ways. The users are supposed to compare the sizes of these sections. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, there are generally three approaches to supporting comparison: juxtaposition, superposition, and explicit encoding of differences or relationships. In application to the color blocks, these approaches can be described as follows.</p><p>• Juxtaposition puts two color sections side by side, which is the design we choose. The advantage of the juxtaposition is that both the individual frequencies of the item in the two data streams and the total frequency of the item can be clearly seen <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 5a</ref>). • Superposition better shows the difference between the frequencies but lacks the capability to show the overall frequency of an item <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 5b)</ref>. When the smaller section is shown in a semi-transparent mode, the color fusion can lead to visual clutter. • Explicit encoding can facilitate assessing the difference; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 5c</ref>) however, the use of additional marks complicates the appearance. These marks would be hardly discernible in the "small multiples" mode used for the "comparison of comparisons" operation. Therefore, we avoid additional encoding of the differences, which would complicate the design.</p><p>We conclude that the design of Co-Bridges is more suitable for our purposes than the two-level design alternatives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">INTERACTIVE VISUAL COMPARISON</head><p>In this section, we propose a workflow for the interactive visual comparison by means of Co-Bridges ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). To illustrate the supporting functions, we have implemented a visual analytics system <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 3</ref>) customized to Twitter Data. Users' comparison strategy (Section 3.3) is supported through the visual exploration workflow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Comparison Entry: Sub-stream Selection</head><p>At the beginning of a session, Co-Bridges show an overview of all data. The bridges accommodate the items with the highest frequencies in the whole dataset (C1). For a more detailed exploration, users need to select subsets of the data, further referred to as sub-streams (C3). We provide three ways to enable users to select sub-streams for comparison: textual query, item graph node selection, and iterative attribute-based filtering applied to the currently explored (sub)set. These three ways complement each other and provide exploration flexibility for the users.</p><p>The first way is the textual query tool, which provides an input box for users to type in the expected item labels. Suggestions and auto-completion based on processed items will pop up to help users better search for appropriate items. The textual query is a classical way of item selection. The advantage is that the textual query provides a comprehensive entrance that any words in the data can be queried. Another advantage is that such tools are quite familiar to users. The drawback is that users may not know what items to search for.</p><p>The second way is aimed to compensate for the latter drawback of the use of a textual query. We create a graph display of the items and their co-occurrence relationships <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 3a)</ref>. Each node represents an item. The size and/or color of a node can encode item-related information. In particular, the node size can encode the overall frequency, and colored segments can represent the frequencies in the two streams. A link between two nodes indicates the co-occurrence relationship between two items. If two items occur together more often, their positions will be closer in the force-directed layout. The rationale for showing co-occurrences is that they are likely to reflect important relationships among items, which may inform and guide users' selections. To avoid clutter, we apply a collision detection and resolving technique for both labels and nodes. Users can select nodes by clicking or brushing to select the sub-streams containing the corresponding items for comparison. The graph view can be customized for different applications. In the social media example, we construct a graph of keywords appearing in the texts <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 3a)</ref> and, additionally, a graph of hashtags (words starting with #) and a graph of usernames mentioned in the texts (words starting with @). Third, users can employ an attribute-based filter, in which any attributes available in the data can be used. Generally, the design of the attribute-based filtering tool is application-dependent (it depends on the attributes present in the data). However, there is a common operation: selection of items shown on the bridges for iterative comparison (S2). In response, the sub-streams involving the selected items are shown, and the other items related to the selected items can be seen. This feature encourages users to explore relationships between items.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Detail-level Visual Comparison</head><p>At this level, the user performs detailed comparison of two selected sub-streams. Both the visual design and interaction facilities work together to achieve the comparison tasks.</p><p>In Co-Bridges, users can observe the overall temporal pattern by scanning sequentially along the river direction (S1). Peaks and general trends are reflected in the shapes of the river sides, i.e., the line plots. For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3b</ref>), users can compare the trends of the substreams containing the item "great". There are two large peaks on the left (Hillary Clinton), whereas Trump (on the right) consistently posts more tweets containing "great".</p><p>To investigate more details, users can brush a time period along the river side. We provide semantic zooming that exposes more details in a finer granularity of time. In the same example, users brush the time period from Aug.22 to Sep.18. The zoomed Co-Bridges view shows the temporal patterns with the data aggregated by days ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 7)</ref>. More details are revealed: in some days (e.g. Aug. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>, Clinton also mentioned "great" several times.</p><p>To further support interactive qualitative and quantitative comparison, we provide, additionally to the visual encoding, highlighting and selection functions. When a user hovers an item, the same item appearing in other time periods will be highlighted with a red stroke, which helps users see the variation of the item's frequencies and relative positions over different bridges. Quantitative information about the item also pops up. Items shown in Co-Bridges are also selectable. As described previously, selection of an item results in selecting sub-streams of data containing this item. For the selected sub-streams, an additional instance of Co-Bridges is created. Multiple instances of Co-Bridges shown simultaneously serve as visual summaries of pair-wise similarities and differences, supporting the exploratory operation "comparison of comparisons". </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Visual Summary Level: Comparison of Comparison</head><p>When users select different sub-streams for detailed comparison, they can put interesting instances of Co-Bridges into the Comparison of Comparison view <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). This view contains the small multiples of the visual comparison summaries for different pairs of sub-streams (S3). In this way, the users can compare the similarity-difference patterns shown by the visual summaries. A text above each Co-Bridges instance indicates the criterion by which the sub-streams were selected.</p><p>The possible patterns that can be compared include: (1) Dominating items for one side; (2) Items with significant quantitative difference;</p><p>(3) Items co-occurring with distinct contextual items; (4) Items with different temporal patterns of appearance. For example, in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, we can see the following differences: (1) Only Trump mentioned "#AmericaFirst", and he mentioned it as a slogan. (2) Clinton mentioned "families" more often, and Trump liked to say "great". These words are mostly put on one or another side, which highlights the difference.</p><p>(3) Concerning the item "America", both politicians mentioned it quite frequently. Clinton mentioned it slightly more frequently and often in connection to words like "gun", "people", etc, while Trump preferred to use keywords "great" and "MakeAmericaGreatAgain". (4) The temporal pattern of Trump's "#AmericFirst" is different from others, with a gap at Jul.24 and late August.</p><p>The "Comparison of comparisons" view is linked to the detailed comparison view. Users can brush the time in the detailed view, and the small multiples will be updated to show the selected time interval in more detail. When users highlight items in one Co-Bridges instance, the occurrences of the same items in other instances will also be highlighted to help users see similarities and differences in the times, frequencies, and co-occurrences with other items. This helps users connect information pieces from multiple views. Users can interactively add or delete an instance of Co-Bridges. A function of sorting the small <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>. Comparative exploration of the tweets of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the U.S Presidential Election Campaign of 2016. We investigate the virtual battle between them looking at the sub-streams containing the items (a) "Donald" and (b)"Clinton". From the discussion overview of "Donald" , we iteratively explore how Clinton "attacked" Donald on (a1) "tax" and (a2) "Pence" issues as well as Trump's "defence". From the discussion overview of "Clinton", we identified (b1) Trump's "attack" with words like "Crooked" and "CNN" as well as (b2) Clinton's defence. Interesting patterns can thus be derived from Comparison of Comparisons. multiples based on different criteria, e.g. accumulated difference of the items, is provided.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Iterative Exploration</head><p>The combination of the visual displays and interaction facilities enables high flexibility in comparing the data streams. We support multiple ways of selecting sub-streams to be compared. Users can refine the exploration through further selections within already selected sub-streams and/or by focusing on smaller time intervals. In the "Comparison of comparisons" view ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>), visual summaries can be added, deleted, and updated according to the user's current interests. In the iterative process, various insights can be derived by exploring different aspects of the data streams <ref type="figure">(Figure 8</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">GENERALIZATION STUDY</head><p>To test the generality of the Co-Bridges design and approach to comparative exploration, we apply it to two example datasets: texts from social media and events that happened in a football game. We test whether Co-Bridges can enable us to obtain interesting findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Social Media Comparison</head><p>With Co-Bridges, we have found several interesting patterns by comparing the tweets of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in their presidential election campaign of 2016 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 8)</ref>.</p><p>From the overview, we find that "Donald" and "Clinton" were mentioned frequently by Clinton and Trump, respectively. It indicates that they commented and criticized each other. We are curious about what they usually said when they mentioned their opponent's name. Co-Bridges provides two comparative overviews for the items "Donald" <ref type="figure">(Figure 8a</ref>) and "Clinton" <ref type="figure">(Figure 8b</ref>). In the texts related to "Donald", words from the Clinton's texts dominated. The words "Tax", "People", and "Pence" were frequently mentioned. We select "Tax" and find that Clinton continuously criticized Trump's "tax plan", which is good for the wealthy people. Besides, Clinton challenged Trump's tax declaration <ref type="figure">(Figure 8-a1</ref>). By exploring "Pence", we found that Clinton criticized Pence for being anti-women, anti-LGBTQ, anti-immigrant, etc. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 8-a2</ref>). Trump somehow tried to "fight back" by using "TrumpPence16", signifying the close collaboration between Pence and him. By semantically zooming in to the daily level, we find that on Jul.23 Clinton criticized Pence for slashing education funding.</p><p>In the texts related to "Clinton" <ref type="figure">(Figure 8b)</ref>, not only Trump mentioned Clinton many times, but also Clinton herself mentioned this item frequently in the weeks around Jul.24. Different from the "soft" words Clinton used, Trump used the words like "crooked" and "bad" in relation to Clinton and CNN. He even created a hashtag "#Crooked-Hillary" <ref type="figure">(Figure 8b1</ref>). For the Clinton's side, we are curious how she defended herself when mentioning her name. We drill down to the week around Jul.24. We find that Clinton was re-posting the messages praising herself from other social media users or media accounts, e.g. Potus, with most of the words being good <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 8b2)</ref>.</p><p>In this case, we compared the text streams of Clinton and Trump regarding multiple discussing issues and different levels of time gran-ularity. The iterative exploration and "Comparison of comparisons" enabled us to compare multiple aspects of the two data streams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Football Event Sequence Comparison</head><p>In this example, we apply Co-Bridges to compare the sequences of events that happened during a football match under the ball possession by two opponent teams. Our example dataset describes the game of Brazil vs. Belgium in the World Cup 2018. The event records include two kinds of items: action types (shooting, passing, etc.) and the names of players who performed the actions. We select the sub-streams consisting of the recorded shooting events (not necessarily successful) by an attribute-based filter. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>-left illustrates the comparison of the event sequences between the teams. Brazil is encoded in pink and Belgium in blue. The final result of the game was Brazil 1:2 Belgium. Among the scores, there was an own-goal of Brazil. Our session of comparative exploration includes the following activities and respective findings:</p><p>• Neymar was more active in the first quarter and the last quarter of the game. Douglas was especially active and involved in multiple shots during 3:00-3:15. We can also identify time periods with specific features. For example, at 2:05-2:15, there was a high number of distinct Belgian players involved in shots. The possibility of applying the approach to different kinds of data signifies its generality. Moreover, the two applications of Co-Bridges were also tested in the user study, and the results confirmed that users can successfully use our tool and obtain most of the above-mentioned findings (Section 7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">USER EVALUATION</head><p>To evaluate users' understanding and the effectiveness of Co-Bridges, we conducted a controlled study for comparing Co-Bridges against the baseline <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4</ref>) using the Twitter data and the football events data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">User Study Method</head><p>The main independent variable explored in the study is the use of Co-Bridges or the baseline visualization. Given that the Twitter and football datasets have different types of data and different complexity, we analyze and report the result of each dataset separately, and thus, do not include the dataset as an independent variable for analysis.</p><p>Participants: We recruited 36 participants (17 females), including visualization researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, college students who majored in visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, and participants without visualization experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</p><p>Datasets: We chose the Twitter data and the football data described in Section 6. The twitter data has a larger number of items, and they are more diverse (words), while the football data has fewer items and a smaller number of item types (events and players). In the Twitter data, we select all Hillary Clinton's and Donald Trump's Tweet data sub-streams involving "great" <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 3b</ref>). In the football data, we select the sub-streams containing the "shots" events ( <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). To ensure a fair comparison, we controlled the aggregation level, showing the labels at the same aggregation level for Co-Bridges and the baseline visualization.</p><p>Procedure and Tasks: The participants were randomly divided into two equal size groups. All participants were presented a video tutorial explaining the Co-Bridges and the baseline visualization. To mitigate the possible learning effect, group 1 first worked on Co-Bridges design with twitter data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 3b</ref>) and then the baseline visualization with football data (The figure is in the supplementary material). Group 2 <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. User study interface with the drag-and-drop tool for task answering. It is one of the four analysis environments, in which Co-Bridges is used with the football event sequence data.</p><p>first worked on the baseline visualization with Twitter data <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>) and then the Co-Bridges design with football data <ref type="figure">(Figure 9</ref>). For each dataset, we conducted a between-subject study for evaluating the accuracy and completion time of their corresponding tasks.</p><p>We developed an interactive drag-and-drop environment for the user study ( <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). In this environment, each participant gets an image of the visualization to evaluate with only the hovering function and a list of tasks. Each task has a label 1, 2, 3 ...8. To answer the tasks, the participants needed to drag these labels to the corresponding parts of the visualization in the provided image, according to their understanding of the tasks. We evaluate answers by comparing them to the available ground truth, thus assessing users' understanding of the visualization. In a few cases of ambiguity, we verified answers with the participants. We record the accuracy and completion time of this process, which reflect participants' understanding and usage of the visualization. We also provide an example for the participants (e.g. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> -task0). For this study, we presented four settings across two groups of users (two visualizations × two datasets).</p><p>There are eight concrete tasks for each dataset, based on the general tasks T1 -T4 in Section 3.1. An example task list for the football data is in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. The ground-truth answers are correspondingly in Section 6.2. Information with task details can be found in the supplemental materials. After completing the tasks, participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire focusing on their subjective evaluation of the following three criteria: (1) Ease/difficulty in understanding Co-Bridges and the baseline visualization; (2) Ease/difficulty in using the two approaches for comparison; (3) the aesthetic appearance of the two approaches. Besides, we also asked for their general feedback.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">User Study Results</head><p>Each user submitted two screenshots of their task completion. The completion time was recorded. The accuracy was verified based on the ground truth. For the tasks with multiple possible answers, the selection of any of these answers was treated as a correct answer. For both datasets, we performed unpaired t-tests for comparing the significance in the difference of the accuracy and the completion time between the two visualizations. Finally, we performed the paired t-tests for all the participants about their subjective feedback on the aforementioned three criteria. <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref>. Accuracy rate and completion time for the Twitter and football datasets with the Co-Bridges and baseline visualization. Each group has 18 participants, and the time unit is one minute.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.1">Twitter Dataset</head><p>Significant difference was found in the accuracy rate (t (36) = 2.92, p &lt; 0.01, η 2 = 0.95) ( <ref type="figure">Figure 10a</ref>). The analysis result indicated that Co-Bridges (M=0.88, SD = 0.13) enabled significantly higher accuracy than the baseline visualization (M=0.73, SD = 0.18). By examining the detailed task accuracy, we found that the accuracy of tasks 1 -5 with both designs was relatively high (&gt; 80%). Tasks 6, 7, 8 are 94.4%/77.8%, 72.2%/44.4%, and 61.1%/11.1% (Co-Bridges/baseline visualization). It turned out that Co-Bridges is easier to use for local comparisons in particular time ranges. The completion time difference was not statistically significant. The times for Co-Bridges (M=3.73 min, SD = 1.65) and baseline visualization (M =3.72 min, SD=0.91) were quite similar <ref type="figure">(Figure 10c</ref>). The variance of the completion times with the use of Co-Bridges was much larger for this dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.2">Football Dataset</head><p>The complexity of the football data is lower. Both groups achieved relatively high accuracy rates ,and there was no statistically significant difference: Co-Bridges (M=0.88, SD = 0.12) and baseline visualization (M=0.87, SD = 0.15) <ref type="figure">(Figure 10b</ref>). For tasks 1 -6, the accuracy rates for both designs were high. The accuracy rates of Tasks 7 and 8 were 77.8%/66.7% and 50%/66.7% (Co-Bridges/baseline visualization). We found that the accuracy of Task 8 in Co-Bridges was relatively low due to the limitations of Co-Bridges, which will be discussed in the next section. The completion time of the two designs was also not significantly different: Co-Bridges (M=3.63 min, SD=1.89) and baseline visualization (M=3.64 min, SD = 1.19). In short, with this study, it was confirmed that our approach can be applied to different applications, and participants could understand and conduct a comparison with Co-Bridges (average accuracy rate: 86.8%). The questionnaire uses a 5-point Likert scale. We map the five points from best to worst to 1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, and 0. Because both groups of participants used Co-Bridges and the baseline visualization, we conducted paired t-tests for the three quantified subjective feedback <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 11</ref>). For the ease of understanding, there was no significant difference for the participants: Co-Bridges (M=0.61, SD=0.19, between neutral and easy to understand) and baseline visualization (M=60, SD=0.22, between neutral and easy to understand) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 11a</ref>). For the ease of comparison, the opinions from the participants towards the two designs are significantly different (t (36) = 2.17, p &lt; 0.05, η 2 = 0.95) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 11b</ref>). Co-Bridges (M=0.67, SD = 0.21, between neutral and easy to use) were regarded better for the comparison tasks than the baseline visualization (M=0.58, SD=0.22, between neutral and easy to use). For the aesthetic appearance, the users preferred Co-Bridges more. The difference was significant (t (36) = 4.31, p &lt; 0.001, η 2 = 0.95) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 11c</ref>): Co-Bridges (M=0.78, SD = 0.25, between more or less nice to nice) and the baseline visualization (M=0.57, SD = 0.24, between neutral to more or less nice). Some participants mentioned that the baseline visualization wastes more space and the items are smaller. We also interviewed the participants and their feedback is generally positive. For example, one participant mentioned "I like the bridge metaphor, which attracts me exploring the visualization. And it is suitable for the comparison task".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.3">General Subjective Feedback</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">User Study Summary and Discussion</head><p>Our study confirmed that Co-Bridges designs are generally understandable and can be used to conduct comparison tasks. For a simpler dataset (football), Co-Bridges achieved the same high accuracy as the baseline visualization. For a more complex dataset (social media), Co-Bridges had higher accuracy for conducting comparison tasks, while taking a similar completion time as the baseline visualization. Subjective feedback also reflected participants' preference for Co-Bridges.</p><p>The evaluation results are generally positive and provide evidence of the good potential of our approach. We investigate the task for which the accuracy was low in the football application. The task is to identify the time period with the most involvement of players from the Belgium side <ref type="figure">(Figure 9-task8)</ref>, which requires quantitative comparison. The correct answer is 2:10-2:15, with four players involved. We examined the wrong answers and found that many wrong answers referred to 2:40-2:45 with three players. One possible reason for the failure might be that the people might be misled by the dominating visual effect of Belgium in the bridge for the interval 2:40-2:45, even though this bridge is thinner and the players are less than at 2:10-2:15. This indicates that the Co-Bridges design might not be suitable for global comparisons (comparison across multiple time periods) with small differences between time intervals. We acknowledge that might be a disadvantage of CO-Bridges: items with the same frequency proportion in different bridges may be different in width. The interaction functions in the visual analytics system can be helpful to compensate for this weakness. At the same time, Co-Bridges are especially well suited for local comparisons, which can be confirmed by a positive example. The answer to task 8 in the social media dataset <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 3b</ref>) should be the word "MakeAmericaGreatAgain". In Co-Bridges, the word is laid out on the rightmost and stands out. However, in the baseline visualization, it is not easy to spot this answer. This explains why the accuracy rate of task 8 for Co-Bridges was much higher than for the baseline visualization.</p><p>We also interviewed several users, and most of them expressed positive feedback regarding our method. We were especially interested to test the understanding and usage among the audience without visualization background. These participants expressed that the bridge metaphor triggered their curiosity to explore the visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">OVERALL DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</head><p>We have conceived and developed Co-Bridges as a general, widely applicable visual comparison approach. We presented the approach in general, domain-independent terms, and we tested it in two quite different domains. We have several take-away messages for applying Co-Bridges to a new dataset. First, choosing different types of elements for comparison makes the application range even wider. For example, in the Twitter dataset, we can compare data related to different users, different keywords from the texts, different hashtags, different topics extracted by topic modeling, or streams of the same user produced in different time periods, or event streams of different users from different periods (e.g., texts from Obama and Trump produced during their respective election campaigns). It is also the motivation for us to define Co-Bridges as general as possible. Second, the river design is, in principle, applicable for the comparison of dynamic streams with new data appearing over time. Third, Co-Bridges can be applied to outcomes of various data processing and analysis methods, such as entity recognition, topic modeling, event extraction, and others.</p><p>A general limitation of the Co-Bridges is the scalability regarding the number of distinct items. The current solution is to show the most prominent items and to enable flexible selections for seeing more details. In the future, we shall also consider providing further semantic zooming in the horizontal dimension.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>The visual metaphor for comparison.

Douglas Costa and Neymar were among the major players related to shooting (i.e., they shot or assisted) in Brazil.
