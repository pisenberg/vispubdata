<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>With the development of location-acquisition technologies, geographical coordinates of objects and events are easily collected, offering an unprecedented opportunity for geospatial exploration and urban analysis. In general, geographical point datasets are comprised of two components, including geographical coordinates and attribute descriptions. Scatterplots are always employed to present the spatial distribution of geographical points <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, while the attributes of points are encoded with a variety of visual elements, such as sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, colors <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref> and meaningful glyphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>. However, scatterplots often suffer from an overdraw problem. A large amount of visual clutter will be generated in those high-density regions, making it difficult to perceive the latent features of interest from original geographical point datasets, especially with the increase of data sizes.</p><p>A large number of methods have been proposed to alleviate the overdraw problem of scatterplots, which can be classified into two categories, including density estimation and sampling. In the density estimation strategies, continuous density functions are calculated and encoded with colors to simulate point distribution in the scatterplots <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. In the sampling strategies, a subset of points are selected as representatives to reduce the visual clutter of original scatterplots. For example, Bertini and Santucci <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> developed a perception-driven sampling method to preserve the relative density difference between different areas. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed a non-uniform recursive sampling method to present the relative data and class densities. It can be seen that traditional methods focus on point densities, which are highly related to geographical coordinates. However, the attribute information is ignored in the course of sampling, which plays a significant role in geospatial exploration. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure  1</ref>(b), the spatial distribution of points is largely preserved, while the attribute relationships are changed severely <ref type="figure">(Figure 1(a)</ref>), e.g., the spatial autocorrelation of point P is changed from HL (high-valued point surrounded by low-valued points) to HH (high-valued point surrounded by high-valued points), which might bring ambiguity for the analysis and exploration of original geographical point datasets.</p><p>In the field of geospatial statistics, spatial autocorrelation is commonly used to characterize the spatial variation of attributes across geographical areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. For example, positive spatial autocorrelation is a tendency for those sites located nearby sharing similar attribute values. By contrast, negative spatial autocorrelation is a tendency for the locations that are close together to have contrasting attribute values, i.e., if a value is high, the others located nearby tend to be low and vice versa. The presence of spatial autocorrelation implies features of interest behind the observed spatial variation of attributes, such as correlation degree and spatial dependence, which largely impacts the identification of spatial variability, spatial modeling and exploratory spatial data analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Thus, spatial autocorrelation is widely used in a variety of application areas such as analyzing the clusters and dispersion of ecology and disease. For example, users can easily understand whether a disease is isolated, clustered or spreading in the course of dispersion according to the spatial autocorrelation features. Therefore, it is quite important to preserve the attribute relationships such as spatial autocorrelations in the sampled geographical point datasets.</p><p>In this paper, we propose an attribute-based sampling method for visual abstraction of large-scale geographical points, which does not only preserve the point densities but also maintain their spatial autocorrelations. Firstly, we utilize Moran's I <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> to capture the spatial autocorrelations of points and present their attribute relationships with Moran Scatterplots. Then, we propose an attribute-based sampling model to select a subset of representative points, in which point densities are preserved by Z-order sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, while the attribute relationships are retained by selecting those points with consistent spatial autocorrelations. Also, a set of visual cues are designed to highlight those ambiguous points whose spatial autocorrelations are drastically changed, and a series of user-guided replacing interactions are provided enabling users to further optimize the sampled points. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>(b) presents the sampled points of our method. It can be seen that the spatial distributions and autocorrelations of geographical points are better preserved compared with the other method, e.g., the spatial autocorrelation of point P is HL, which is consistent to its original feature. Furthermore, a set of case studies and quantitative comparisons based on the real-world datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the abstraction and exploration of large-scale geographical point datasets. In summary, the main contributions of our work are:</p><p>• An attribute-based sampling model is proposed to reduce the visual clutter of large-scale geographical point data visualization, which largely preserves the spatial autocorrelations of points in addition to their spatial densities.</p><p>• A set of visual cues are designed to highlight those ambiguous points with inconsistent spatial autocorrelations, and a series of user-guided interactions are further provided to optimize the sampled geographical points.</p><p>• Case studies, quantitative comparisons and expert interviews based on the real-world datasets are conducted to compare different sampling strategies and further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the abstraction and exploration of large-scale geographical point datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK 2.1 Geographical point data visualization</head><p>Geographical datasets are always depicted with different visual shapes, such as points, lines and polygons <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>. As a tradi-tional point-based visualization method <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>, scatterplots place dots on the geographical map, enabling users to visually perceive the spatial distribution of geo-tagged datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Slocum et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> provided an overview of geographical point data visualization, in which points are usually represented with different-sized glyphs. Pack et al. developed IncidentCluster Explorer <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> to present the incident frequency and distribution with informative icons on the map. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> encoded the transportation cells with colors, sizes and arrows to convey the traffic speed, flow volume and moving direction. Zeng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> designed a radial glyph to present the interchange patterns between urban metro systems. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> designed an icon-based condition node to set query conditions in the map view for the exploration of spatio-temporal urban datasets. Aman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> proposed a geo-temporal tag visualization method, which utilized specified glyphs to present the temporal information of geographical points.</p><p>To enhance the visual perception of global distribution of scatterplots, Dörk et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> merged points located nearby into clusters and visualized them as circles of different sizes. Jänicke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> proposed a clutter-free visualization by grouping glyphs into circles in a map view. Scheepens et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> designed an aggregated multivariate glyph to present the attributes of high-density points, which performed well for the density estimation of scatterplots. However, point-based geospatial data visualizations often suffer from an overdraw problem, especially with the increase of data sizes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Overdraw reduction for scatterplots</head><p>As a conceptual solution to resolve the overdraw problem of largescale point-based visualization, visual abstraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> transforms data representations by suppressing and removing those unimportant features attributed to natural variations. In visualization community, a couple of visual abstraction strategies are commonly used to reduce the visual clutter of scatterplots, such as density estimation and sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Density estimation methods convert scatterplots into a color-encoding density map or a group of contour lines based on the density distribution of points <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. In this way, high density areas present obvious characteristics while the outliers and sparse areas are difficult to perceive due to their smaller densities.</p><p>Sampling is another kind of strategy to enhance the visual perception of scatterplots <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>. Ellis and Dix <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> applied random sampling to reduce the scale of points. Bertini and Santucci <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> studied the relationship between spatial density and visual clutter, and proposed an automatic sampling method to preserve the relative densities. Bertini et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> proposed a non-uniform sampling method to preserve the relative densities especially for those low density areas. As an alternative to reduce visual clutter, Z-order sampling is suitable for preserving the kernel density estimation of large-scale scatterplots <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>. Park et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> proposed a visualization-aware sampling (VAS) method to generate high-quality scatterplots at arbitrary zooming resolutions with the tuples sampled as few as possible. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> proposed a multi-class blue noise sampling model <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> to retain the relative densities of different classes for the visual abstraction of multi-class scatterplots. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed a non-uniform recursive sampling method to faithfully preserve the relative class densities without local holes generated in the sampled multi-class scatterplots. Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> utilized Z-order curves for the sampling of multi-class scatterplots, in which point selection is jointly optimized for different views or classes. In the field of cartography, visual abstraction is also used to reduce visual clutter, emphasize essential and preserve aesthetic quality of large-scale point-based geographical visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. For example, Peters <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> proposed an octree-based and scale-dependent method to preserve the spatial densities of points. Bereuter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> proposed a set of quadtree-based algorithms to provide multiple point-oriented operations, such as selection, aggregation and displacement. To enhance the visual perception of large geographic points, Keim et al. proposed several methods to present points of different densities at variable scales such as generalized scatterplots <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and density-equalized maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Attribute-based Spatial Analysis</head><p>A lot of visualization methods have been proposed to present the attribute information of geographical datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Beecham et al. conducted a set of line-up tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and concluded that autocorrelation intensities and geographic structures greatly impacted user perception. Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> presented a visual analytics system to investigate the impacts of attribute uncertainty in choropleth visualization and geographic analysis. He et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> combined traditional thematic maps with infographics to enhance the visual representation of geographical datasets. To overcome the mismatch between data values, and spatial unit sizes, Speckmann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> proposed a visualization of necklace map, in which the intervals, orders and positions of symbols were optimized to generate clear and uncluttered presentations. Griffith et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> constructed an eigenfunction-based spatial filter description to visualize and explore the spatial autocorrelation components. Tiede <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> proposed a novel geospatial overlay method for the visualization and analysis of spatial patterns based on a set of object-oriented data modeling concepts.</p><p>Attribute information is always taken for geographical analysis in the field of spatial statistics. Dormann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> provided an overview of six kinds of spatial statistical methods and tested the statistical significance of species distributions with the spatial autocorrelations taken into consideration. Baumont et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> studied intra-urban spatial distributions for the population and employment and found that urban agglomeration was characterized by a monocentric pattern.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS AND SYSTEM OVERVIEW</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Requirement Analysis</head><p>Our research focus is derived from the discussions with two domain experts (E1 and E2). E1 is a professional researcher working in a research institute. She focuses on the research of geospatial analysis for about 20 years. She has a solid understanding of geographical visualization and spatial autocorrelations and often applies relative methods to explore large-scale geographical point datasets in her studies. E2 is a senior data analyst in a big data operation company. He has been engaged in applied research about geospatial analysis for over 6 years. He is familiar with the geographic information system (GIS), and usually uses the sampling techniques when analyzing and visualizing large-scale geospatial point datasets. In the early stages of our collaboration, we held weekly meetings with the two experts to discuss their recent research projects involving geospatial data analysis. We asked for major issues relevant to the spatial autocorrelation, e.g., how spatial autocorrelations affected the analysis of geographical point datasets. Both the experts believed that spatial autocorrelation was a key indicator to attribute features distributed across areas, which played an important role in further geospatial data exploration, spatial modeling and analysis. Unsurprisingly, the experts thought the limited screen space would hinder users perception of spatial patterns when faced with the large-scale geographical point datasets. Meanwhile, the experts specified that it was quite important to retain the consistency of spatial autocorrelations of the sampled geographical points, which would help them to estimate spatial distributions, discover patterns of spatial clustering and identify outliers. In the form of structured interviews, a list of requirements are distilled and driven by the discussions with experts.</p><p>T1. Attribute-based modeling of geographical point data. For the visual abstraction of scatterplots, data densities are focused in traditional sampling methods, while their attribute relationships are always ignored, which easily makes the sampled points present inconsistent attribute features. The experts claimed that the ambiguous points with inconsistent attribute features would bring much uncertainty for geographical analysis. To enhance the validity of sampled points, it is a primary task to design an attribute-based model to represent the attribute relationships of geographical points, which are expected to be preserved in the sampled geographical points.</p><p>T2. Attribute-based sampling of geographical point data. Attribute relationships of points in local areas can be captured with the attribute-based modeling of geographical points. They are significant features for geographical analysis, which are not considered in the traditional density-based sampling strategies. Therefore, it is a crucial task to propose an attribute-based sampling model through which both the attribute relationships and spatial densities of original geographical points can be better preserved in the sampled results.</p><p>T3. Visual evaluation of sampled geographical point data. In the specific scenarios of geographical analysis, the experts need to be aware of the validity of sampled points in real time. Spatial densities and attribute relationships are expected to be largely preserved in the sampled results. Therefore, targeted metrics and visual cues are required to quantify and visualize the retention of these features, enabling users to evaluate the sampled geographical points from different perspectives.</p><p>T4. Interactive optimization of sampled geographical point data. Through the evaluation of sampled geographical points, users are able to find those local areas presenting ambiguous attribute features. The experts claimed that the attribute relationships of sampled points should be consistent to that of original points for further geographical analysis. Therefore, it is a necessary task to provide users with an interactive optimization scheme to replace those sampled geographical points with inconsistent attribute features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">System Overview</head><p>Motivated by the identified requirements, a novel attribute-based sampling method is proposed to simplify the visualization of largescale geographical points. The pipeline of our visual abstraction system is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. Firstly, Moran Scatterplots are constructed to represent the spatial autocorrelations of geographical points. According to the categories of spatial autocorrelations, geographical points are shaded in different colors enabling users to capture the spatial variation of attributes. Then, we propose an attribute-based sampling model, in which a Z-order curve is utilized to organize original geographical points. Local and neighboring features are identified based on the spatial autocorrelations, and further taken into consideration for the selection and optimization of the sampled points. Thus, the visual clutter of original geographical point data visualization is largely reduced, while both the spatial densities and autocorrelations are preserved with the sampled geographical points. Furthermore, a set of visual cues are designed for visual evaluation of sampled geographical points and interactive optimization of those ambiguous points highlighted with colorful flags. Finally, the sampled geographical points are obtained with little ambiguity in the representation of spatial autocorrelations, which largely facilitate further geospatial analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">ATTRIBUTE-BASED SAMPLING</head><p>In this section, we first utilize a spatial autocorrelation model to capture and visualize the attribute relationships of geographical points (T1). Then, we design an attribute-based sampling model to alleviate the overdraw of large-scale geographical point visualization while preserving both the spatial distributions and autocorrelations of the sampled points (T2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Attribute Modeling</head><p>Moran Scatterplots are able to represent local patterns of attribute association. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>(e) presents the illustration of Moran Scatterplots, the space of which is constructed with a horizontal axis (showing the attribute values of points) and a vertical axis (showing the weighted attribute values of neighboring points), and each data item corresponds to a point in the geographical map. The values distributed on the vertical axis are spatially lagged transformations, which are calculated by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">sp i = ∑ j∈1,2...N w i j z j (1)</formula><p>where w i j is obtained through a row-standardized spatial weight matrix, in which weights are determined based on the assumption that the influence is inversely proportional to the distance</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(1/d i j )</formula><p>. N is the number of neighbors for each point, which is specified as 8 in this work. Of course, it can be specified by users according to their requirements. z j represents the standardized attribute value for point j , which is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">z j = x j − E(x) Var(x) (1 ≤ j ≤ n)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where x j is the attribute value of point j. n is the data size. E(x) and Var(x) are the mean and variance values. In this way, geographical points can be distributed into the space of Moran Scatterplots according to their attributes and spatially lagged transformations. As shown in the Moran Scatterplots <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>  . According to the quantitative representation of spatial autocorrelations, users can easily find those features of interest located behind the spatial variation of attributes.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>(a) and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>(a), the geographical points are shaded in different colors according to their quadrants in the Moran Scatterplots. It can be found that local areas always share common spatial autocorrelation features, which vary drastically with the geometric distance. We also find that geographical point visualization suffers from an overdraw problem, making it difficult to perceive the latent features of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Sampling Model</head><p>Based on the quantitative representation of spatial autocorrelations, we design an attribute-based sampling model to reduce the visual clutter of geographical point visualization while enhancing the visual perception of the spatial autocorrelation features.</p><p>(1) Spatial density preservation For the visual reduction of geographical point visualization, we utilize a Z-order sampling scheme to preserve the spatial densities of geographical points. The major steps are listed as follows:</p><p>Step.1 Division. A quadtree is utilized to recursively subdivide a global geographical space into subregions, until only one point is included in a separate region.</p><p>Step.2 Sorting. A Z-order curve is employed to order the regions from the upper left to lower right. In this way, points located in different regions are loaded into an ordered array.</p><p>Step.3 Sampling. The ordered array is divided into k subsets at equal intervals, and one point is randomly sampled from a subset.</p><p>Thus, the sampling course is guided by a space-filling curve, and k points are sampled that are able to preserve the spatial densities of original geographical points.</p><p>(</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Spatial autocorrelation preservation</head><p>To preserve the spatial autocorrelations of original geographical points, we design a target-driven selection method to replace the random selection in traditional Z-order sampling. First, we define a couple of features to describe spatial autocorrelations of points, such as local feature and neighboring feature as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  3</ref>. If the standardized attribute value of a point is larger than 0, the attribute value of the point will be larger than the overall average. So that, we consider it as a high-valued point and its local feature is defined as H. Otherwise, its local feature is defined as L. If the weighted attribute value of its neighboring points is larger than 0, most of the attribute values of its neighboring points will be larger than the overall average. So that the neighboring feature of this point is defined as H. Otherwise, its neighboring feature is defined as L. It can be seen that the spatial autocorrelation of each point is determined by its local feature and neighboring feature. Thus, we design two schemes to select representative points to preserve their local and neighboring features in different subsets.</p><p>Scheme I. It is noticeable that maintaining the mean of attribute values will largely preserve the local features of the sampled points. If the original proportions of points with local feature H and L are retained well, the mean value of the sampled points will change little. Thus, we introduce a fill-rate based sampling mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> to ensure that points with different local features are sampled according to their original proportion. Fill rate f r(i) is defined as the number of sampled points with local feature i over the target number of points. N i is the target number of the sampled points with local feature i, which is computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">N i = N i * r (3)</formula><p>where N i is the count of the original points with local feature i, and r is the sampling ratio. To maintain an equal fill rate across local features H and L, we select a new point with the local feature that is currently most under-filled. For example, if f r(H) &lt; f r(L), the points with local feature H have priority to be sampled. Otherwise, the points with local feature L have priority to be sampled. Then, we utilize a scheme of roulette-wheel selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> to select a subset possessing the required local features. For a subset M, its local feature is determined by the dominated points with the same local features. For example, P H (M) (the proportion of H points in M) and P L (M) (the proportion of L points in M) are computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P H (M) = ∑ i∈M δ (x i − µ) |M| ,<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">P L (M) = ∑ i∈M δ (µ − x i ) |M| (5)</formula><p>where x i is the attribute value of point i, and µ is the original mean value. If x &gt; 0, δ (x) = 1. Otherwise, δ (x) = 0. If P H (M) &gt; P L (M), the local feature of M is considered as H. Otherwise, it is considered as L. Thus, for all un-sampled subsets, the higher proportion of points with a targeted local feature is, the greater probability a representative point will be sampled in this subset. Scheme II. The neighboring feature of each point is determined based on the local features of its neighbors. Thus, we determine the neighboring features of the sampled points according to the local features of those points in their neighboring subsets. For a subset M and its neighboring subsets S M , P H (M) of H points in M and P L (M) of L points in M are computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P H (M) = ∑ s∈S M γ(local(s) = H) |S M | ,<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">P L (M) = ∑ s∈S M γ(local(s) = L) |S M |<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where local(s) represents the local feature of the subset defined in the Scheme I. γ is an indicator function which returns 1 if the condition is true. Otherwise, the indicator function returns 0. A representative point will be selected from M with the neighboring feature corresponding to the maximum of P H (M) and P L (M). Thus, if local features of most neighboring subsets are H, points with the spatial autocorrelations such as HH or LH will be selected from M. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> illustrates the course of attribute-based sampling based on the above two schemes. According to Scheme I, the local features of sampled points in all subsets are determined as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure  4</ref>(a), and the local feature of the sampled point in M tends to be H as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_8">(d), since P H (M) &gt; P L (M).</formula><p>Then, a representative point is sampled from M with its neighboring feature determined by Scheme II. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>(e) illustrates Scheme II by means of which the neighboring feature of the sampled point tends to be H, since P H (M) &gt; P L (M). Thus, a representative point with HH is sampled from M, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4(b)</ref>. Finally, we select representative points from un-sampled subsets according to Scheme II until all the subsets are sampled <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4(c)</ref>).</p></div>

With a traditional non-uniform distribution, points overlap with each other, making it difficult to perceive their spatial autocorrelation features ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure  5(a)</ref>). Therefore, we provide an optional layout of the Moran Scatterplots, in which a piecewise linear function is constructed to refine the scales of axes according to their densities:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">f i (x) = ω(d i ) * x − S i,min S i,max − S i,min , x ∈ [S i,min , S i,max ] i ∈ [1, T ] (8)</formula><p>where T is the number of segments specified by users.

Thus, the intervals for those segments with lower densities are shortened. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Visual Evaluation of the Sampled Points</head><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of our sampling method, a set of visual designs are provided to visually present the spatial densities and spatial autocorrelations. For the evaluation of the spatial densities of geographical points, a heatmap is provided to present the spatial distribution of sampled geographical points. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1(a)</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>(b), heatmaps are located in the bottom right corners, enabling users to visually perceive the changes of spatial densities. Of course, there are still some sampled points deviating from their original spatial autocorrelation features, which bring much ambiguity for geospatial analysis. To identify the ambiguous points, we carry out two schemes: (1) We label those ambiguous points with specific flags, the colors of which present the spatial autocorrelations they are supposed to be. <ref type="figure">Figure 1(a)</ref> presents the labeled geographical map in which we can easily identify those ambiguous points with colorful flags. (2) We also design a stacked bar chart to present the preservation of spatial autocorrelations, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1(c)</ref>. According to the categories of spatial autocorrelations, four stacked bars are displayed horizontally, and the colors correspond to their spatial autocorrelations. In each stacked bar, the width indicates the count of points and segmental colors indicate those with retained and ambiguous spatial autocorrelations.</p><p>That is, segments with the same color as the left rectangle represent the number of points retaining spatial autocorrelations, and the other segments shaded in different colors are those ambiguous points sharing spatial autocorrelation features corresponding to their colors. The percentages of points retaining spatial autocorrelations are presented on the right of the bar chart. When the user clicks a segment of interest, the amount is immediately presented and the corresponding points are highlighted in the geographical map. The number of ambiguous points is displayed at the upper right corner, enabling users to easily evaluate the effectiveness of different sampling schemes in preserving spatial autocorrelations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Interactive Optimization of the Sampled Points</head><p>It is a difficult task for all the sampled points to keep their original spatial autocorrelations. There are still a small part of ambiguous points generated with our sampling method. We further propose an interactive optimization strategy enabling users to replace the ambiguous points. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 6</ref>, P is an ambiguous point, with an optional point P'. Two criteria are included: (1) If P is replaced with P', the spatial autocorrelation feature of P' must be consistent.</p><p>(2) If P' affects the neighboring features of its surrounding points and the local features of all the sampled points, we will calculate a contribution metric w, which is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">w = N ∑ i=1 (ϕ(φ (LF i , LF i ), ϕ(φ (NF i , NF i )) − ϕ(φ (LF i , LF i ), φ (NF i , NF i ))<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where N is the count of sampled points. Otherwise, ϕ = 0. It can be seen that w represents the decreasing number of ambiguous points after replacement. If w is larger than 0, P' will be a suitable sample. Otherwise, the replacement will not be recommended. Of course, the larger w is, the better the optional point is. An interactive optimization of an ambiguous point is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 6</ref>. When a user specifies an ambiguous sampling point with a labeled flag, a set of optional points in the same subset are distributed on an outer ring. The colors of optional points are determined with criterion (1). Those points shaded in purple mean that their spatial autocorrelations will be retained in the sampled results. In addition, the fluctuation frequency of the optional points is determined with criterion (2). Those points with larger fluctuation frequency mean that they will lead to more ambiguous samples. Therefore, those points with little fluctuation frequency drawn as standard circles are recommended as the samples. The optimization of the sampled points is time-consuming, so that we take it for the replacement of a small part of ambiguous points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">EVALUATION</head><p>We implemented a web-based visualization framework to support the visual abstraction of large-scale geographical point datasets. To accelerate the computing efficiency, a kd-tree structure is applied to access the large-scale geographic point datasets. A set of time-consuming operations such as the construction of Moran Scatterplots and calculation of KDE are conducted in an off-line preprocessing phase. During the online course of abstraction, points are sampled in real-time to preserve both the spatial densities and autocorrelations. Of course, the replacement of ambiguous points takes a little time due to its process of global traversal, which is suitable for a small number of ambiguous points. In this section, three real-world geographical point datasets are applied to conduct case studies for demonstrating the effectiveness of our work. In addition, a set of quantitative comparisons demonstrate the advantages of our attribute-based sampling method in the preservation of spatial densities, abstraction quality and autocorrelations. We further discuss several issues not well resolved in our method and give some reasonable improvements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Case Study</head><p>Three real-world datasets (D1, D2 and D3) are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of our sampling method in the visual abstraction and exploration of large-scale geographical point datasets. They are all extracted from a UK census dataset which is available on the Data Explorer of National Statistics 1 . D1 depicts the proportion of people whose working hours were larger than 48 in a week for 25025 Output Areas of London in 2011. D2 depicts the health proportion statistics for 27363 Output Areas of Southeast England in 2011, and D3 depicts the proportion of deprived households for 18935 Output Areas of Eastern England in 2011.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Case 1. Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis</head><p>We invited the first expert (E1) to explore D1 through our system. Firstly, she loaded D1 into the system and observed the distribution of original geographical points as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 7(a)</ref>. According to the color mapping based on the attribute values, E1 got a rough idea of the spatial distribution with respects to working hours, e.g., people living in the central area worked longer than those living in other areas. However, she commented that this distribution presented few spatial features, making it difficult to further identify geospatial patterns, such as spatial aggregations and outliers. Then, she selected the scheme of color mapping provided by our system, and the geographical points were shaded in different colors according to their spatial autocorrelations in Moran Scatterplots <ref type="figure">(Figure 1(e)</ref>). Observing the distribution of the colored points as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure  7</ref>(b), E1 found that the autocorrelations presented obvious spatial patterns, such as three local areas highlighted with different spatial autocorrelation features. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 7</ref>(e) presented an obvious HH feature in region C, while <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 7(d)</ref> presented an obvious LL feature in region B. By contrast, a number of yellow and orange points (corresponding to HL and LH) were presented in region A ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure  7(c)</ref>), indicating that there were obvious spatial variability features in this local area. In this way, E1 was able to identify outliers, i.e., those points diverging from their neighboring trends.</p><p>Much visual clutter was generated as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 7</ref>(a) and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 7</ref>(b), which largely disturbed data mining and exploration. Then, E1 specified Z-order sampling (ZS) to reduce the data size at a sampling rate 10%. <ref type="figure">Figure 1(a)</ref> presented the sampled geographical view, in which a large number of points were filtered out and the rest points still maintain the spatial densities of the original dataset according to the heatmap. Furthermore, she focused on a point P, and found that its spatial autocorrelation was changed from HL to HH. By examining the original dataset, she found that P was originally surrounded by a large number of low-valued points, the neighborhood trends of which were not preserved, leading it to an ambiguous point. E1 claimed that it was not tolerated because such ambiguous points would bring uncertainty for the geospatial analysis. By contrast, she specified our attribute-based sampling method to reduce the data size at the same sampling rate. <ref type="figure">Figure 1(b)</ref> presented the sampled geographical view, in which the spatial densities could also be preserved according to the heatmap. She found that the spatial autocorrelation of P remained HL that was consistent with its original autocorrelation. Thus, E1 concluded that our method performed better for the retention of spatial autocorrelations.</p><p>To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, E1 conducted a set of sampling operations with different strategies at a lower sampling rate 5%. The corresponding results were presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 8</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 8(c)</ref>, the spatial distribution is visually uniform, which differs largely from that of original geographical points. Furthermore, E1 clicked the button Ambiguity. Compared with our method <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">(Figure 8(h)</ref>), the other sampling methods <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">(Figure 8</ref>(e), <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 8</ref>(f), <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 8</ref>(g)) generate more ambiguous points especially in region A. She claimed that the ambiguous points would have significant impacts on users perception of actual spatial patterns, bringing much uncertainty for correlation analysis. For example, the original autocorrelation of point Q was HH as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 8(h)</ref>, which means that the working hours of Q and its neighboring areas were high enough.</p><p>Observing the details of the original dataset, E1 found that a large number of medical institutions such as Mount Vernon Hospital were located there. E1 thought that most populations in this area were engaged in health care industries and often worked overtime. However, the autocorrelation of Q was changed to HL by Z-order sampling <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">(Figure 8(f)</ref>), which would lead users to a wrong conclusion and fail to identify the correlation between working hours and local enterprise distribution. Finally, E1 approved the performance of our method in generating better sampling results in terms of both spatial densities and spatial autocorrelations. She emphasized that it was of great significance to preserve the spatial autocorrelations of the sampled geographical points for geospatial analysis.</p><p>Case 2. Ambiguity Identification The second expert (E2) was invited to explore D2 (the health proportion statistics of UK census dataset). Similar conclusions were drawn that our method could preserve both the spatial densities  and autocorrelations. He found that there were still a number of points which cannot preserve their spatial autocorrelations. E2 compared the sampled results of ZS and OUR. When he clicked "Ambiguity" button, the ambiguous points were highlighted with flags. It was observed that OUR <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">(Figure 9</ref>(b)) performed better than ZS <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">(Figure 9(a)</ref>), because fewer flags were highlighted. He further focused on the bar charts and found that LL features were retained well and LH features were a little ambiguous with OUR ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure  9</ref>(e)), while there were more ambiguous points generated with ZS <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">(Figure 9(c)</ref>). E2 commented that the ambiguous points were still not a few and wanted to get deeper insights into the causes. Then, E2 paid attention to a region B in our sampled result <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">(Figure 9(b)</ref>) and zoomed in to highlight the details, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 9</ref>(g). The ambiguous points were largely located in a border area between LL and HH. He continued to examine another region A as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 9</ref>(h) and found that the ambiguous points were also located in a border area between LL and HH. Thus, E2 speculated that the neighboring features of these ambiguous points were difficult to preserve, because they were easily changed due to counteractions of attribute values in those areas. To further verify the hypothesis, he focused on Moran scatterplots to check the distribution of the ambiguous points. It can be found that the highlighted ambiguous points obtained with our method lay close to the X-axis as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 9</ref>(f), while the ambiguous points obtained with ZS were distributed all over the coordinate system <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">(Figure 9(d)</ref>). Then, E2 shifted his attention to a local area with HH on the south coast of England, which was easily observed by our method ( <ref type="figure">Figure  10(b)</ref>). However, it was difficult to perceive in the visualization of original dataset <ref type="figure">(Figure 10(a)</ref>) due to massive occlusions of points. Furthermore, E2 found this area belonged to a famous coastal city Brighton, and people lived here due to its good living environment. Meanwhile, the adequate tourist income presented a high-level healthcare and health proportion. With the other sampling methods, E2 found that the spatial patterns of interest were easily missed due to a great deal of ambiguous points. Based on the comparisons, E2 concluded that our method made a great improvement on the preservation of spatial autocorrelations compared with traditional sampling methods. But, it was still difficult to maintain the spatial autocorrelations of all points, especially for those located around the borders between different spatial autocorrelation aggregations.</p><p>Case 3. Interactive Replacement E2 found the causes of ambiguous points and tried to replace them with suitable points. Thus, he studied the online interactive replacement provided by our system and further explored the dataset D3. Firstly, E2 conducted a sampling operation on D3 by means of our method, and highlighted the ambiguous points with flags. Then, he focused on a local region of interest corresponding to the urban area of Ipswich, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>(a), and paid attention to an ambiguous point P. When it was clicked, all the candidates in the same subset were immediately distributed around P with meaningful glyphs as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 11(b)</ref>.</p><p>E2 noticed that the candidates were shaded in different colors and drawn with various outlines, which were determined according to whether their spatial autocorrelations could be preserved and how much they affected the spatial autocorrelations of other sampled points. When E2 clicked a candidate P1 (shaded in cyan and with a large fluctuation frequency), the spatial autocorrelation of P1 was still inconsistent and two new ambiguous points (highlighted as red) were generated as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 11(d)</ref>. When E2 clicked a candidate P2 (shaded in purple and with a large fluctuation frequency), the <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>: Original geographical points (a) and sampled points with our method (b) for the dataset D2. Region A highlighted in (b) presents an obvious spatial clustering of HH, which is difficult to find in the original dataset due to massive occlusions in (a). spatial autocorrelation of P2 was retained (indicated by the presence of green point) but there was still a new ambiguous point generated as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>(e). He continued to explore another candidate P3 shaded in purple and with a low fluctuation frequency. The spatial autocorrelation of the subset was well retained since there was no red point at this time. It was noticeable that two ambiguous points (highlighted as green) in neighboring areas were recovered and retained their original spatial autocorrelations as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>(f). Thus, P3 was the best candidate to replace P, because it maintains the local and global spatial autocorrelations of the sampled points. After a series of replacement operations, there was no ambiguity in the urban area of Ipswich as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>(c). He found that these regions nearby the central and coastal areas were obviously characterized with LL. On the contrary, the eastern region presented a spatial clustering characteristic of HH, which indicated that the living conditions such as education, employment and healthcare in this region were lower than that of central regions. E2 also commented that it was time-consuming to interactively optimize the sampled points. However, it made those sampled points preserve their spatial autocorrelations, which largely improved sampling quality and facilitated geospatial analysis. The visual designs such as color mapping and shape encoding largely assisted him to determine which candidate was suitable for replacement. It was of great help for the exploration of spatial autocorrelation across local areas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Quantitative Comparison</head><p>To further evaluate the effectiveness of our sampling method, three quantitative comparisons are conducted from the perspectives of spatial density <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, abstraction quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and spatial autocorrelation. Sampling strategies are all performed 30 times and the weighted results are recorded in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Spatial Density. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is a commonlyused metric to evaluate spatial distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. The statistics of KDE errors with different sampling strategies at specified sampling rates are presented in the left part of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. For D2 and D3, BNS performs better than the other sampling strategies, especially at lower sampling rates. The spatial densities of the sampled results obtained by our method are also well preserved especially for D1, probably due to its obvious spatial patterns. Our method performs similarly to ZS, because points are sampled in the same subsets. Both ZS and OUR perform better than RS at all sampling rates and a little better than BNS at higher sampling rates.</p><p>Abstraction Quality. Histogram difference measure (HDM) is a useful metric to evaluate the quality of data abstraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. As shown in the middle part of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, our method outperforms the other sampling strategies for D1 and the abstraction qualities are almost the highest at all the sampling rates. For D2, OUR, ZS and RS achieve similar results and perform better than BNS. For D3, ZS performs a little better than our method. In conclusion, BNS performs the worst and RS has a fluctuating performance. Our method and ZS present advantages in terms of abstraction quality.</p><p>Spatial Autocorrelation. We define a metric of accuracy rate to <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>: Illustration of the course of interactive replacement for ambiguous points.

Larger accuracy rate means more points preserve their spatial autocorrelations in the sampled results. As shown in the right part of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, our method performs better than the other sampling methods and the spatial autocorrelations are well preserved for all datasets. It is curious that RS is superior to traditional density-based sampling methods such as BNS and ZS, which indicates that spatial autocorrelations differ from spatial distributions. Thus, it might be difficult to maintain attribute association relationships by retaining spatial distribution, which further demonstrates the significance of our method in the maintaining of spatial autocorrelations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Expert Interview</head><p>We conducted in-depth interviews with two domain experts to evaluate the effectiveness of our system. We first introduced the usages of our system and invited them to conduct geospatial analysis. Then, we collected their feedbacks to analyze real-world datasets. System usability and improvement. Both two experts appreciated our system in preserving spatial autocorrelations, which was of great significance for geospatial analysis and statistical analysis. E1 claimed that "The increasing data sizes bring much difficulty for data processing and exploration. This system provides an efficient tool for the reduction of large-scale geographical point datasets. Meanwhile, the spatial density and autocorrelation are well preserved which are quite important for geospatial analysis." E1 also suggested that "Multiple attributes can be further integrated into the sampling model, and more features of interest would be retained in the sampled datasets." E2 emphasized that "This system calculates the spatial autocorrelations of geographical points, and reduces the visual clutter with an attribute-based sampling model. Both the spatial densities and autocorrelations are well preserved in the sampled geographical points. It is innovative, and the sampled results largely facilitate geospatial analysis and feature calculation." E2 also put forward some suggestions for the improvement of our system. "The system outperforms traditional sampling methods, and it will play a great role in the field of statistical analysis if the attribute-based sampling model is integrated into the geospatial analysis software."</p><p>Visual design and interaction. Both two experts carefully studied and used the visual designs and interactions of our system, and found that they were not only intuitive but also easy to operate. E1 commented that "The visual designs of Moran scatterplots are intuitive, through which the users can easily identify the spatial autocorrelations of geographical points." E1 also suggested "It would be helpful to allow geoscientists to interactively conduct sampling operations on those local regions of interest at alterable sampling rates according to their requirements." E2 thought that "The design of bar charts is very intuitive, which cannot only reflect the number of the sampled points, but also present the proportion of the ambiguous points at a glance. They are also associated with the geographical map for intuitive spatial presentation." In addition, E2 also appreciated the interactive optimization and mentioned that "If there are many ambiguous points in a certain area, users often want to analyze the causes. When an ambiguous point highlighted with a flag is specified, the changes of spatial autocorrelations are presented allowing users to easily determine which candidate is a suitable sample for replacement. It has much application value."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Discussion</head><p>The cluttered visualization of large geographical point datasets is effectively simplified by means of our sampling-based abstraction method. Spatial densities and autocorrelation characteristics are both well preserved with the sampled geographical points. But, there are still some issues not well resolved in this paper. (1) Spatial autocorrelation is able to characterize the spatial dependence of attribute values of geographical points. It is one aspect of spatial relationships of geospatial points, while some detailed characteristics such as spatial variability and heterogeneity of geographical points are not characterized, which also play important roles for the geospatial modeling and spatial analysis. In future work, we will further examine the spatial variogram and analysis model to depict the spatial relationships of geographical points and try to retain them in the course of sampling. (2) The attributes of geographical points usually vary with time. In this work, we focus on the analysis of static attributes, while the temporal variation of attributes is not considered. Thus, the sampled geographical points will not present time-varying features and contribute little to the analysis of spatiotemporal events. In future work, we will integrate time attributes into our sampling model to preserve the spatio-temporal features.</p><p>(3) In this work, we provide an interactive operation for users to replace those ambiguous points. However, the replacement-based optimization depends on a set of global traversal operations, which is a time-consuming task and just suitable for the replacement of a small number of points. In the future work, we will take more spatial features and attribute relationships into consideration, and try to increase the efficiency of replacement operations by means of a local optimization mechanism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we propose an attribute-based sampling method for visual abstraction of large-scale geographical point visualization.</p><p>To represent attribute relationships of geographical points, Moran scatterplots are applied and the spatial autocorrelations are classified into four categories like HH, HL, LH and LL.

A rich set of visual cues are designed enabling users to visually evaluate and interactively optimize the sampled geographical points. The effectiveness of our sampling method in abstraction and exploration of large geographical point datasets is further demonstrated with case studies and quantitative comparisons based on the real-world datasets.
