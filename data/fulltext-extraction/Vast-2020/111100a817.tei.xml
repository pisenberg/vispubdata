				<p>Bus routes are typically updated every 3-5 years to meet constantly changing travel demands. However, identifying deficient bus routes and finding their optimal replacements remain challenging due to the difficulties in analyzing a complex bus network and the large solution space comprising alternative routes. Most of the automated approaches cannot produce satisfactory results in real-world settings without laborious inspection and evaluation of the candidates. The limitations observed in these approaches motivate us to collaborate with domain experts and propose a visual analytics solution for the performance analysis and incremental planning of bus routes based on an existing bus network. Developing such a solution involves three major challenges, namely, a) the in-depth analysis of complex bus route networks, b) the interactive generation of improved route candidates, and c) the effective evaluation of alternative bus routes. For challenge a, we employ an overview-to-detail approach by dividing the analysis of a complex bus network into three levels to facilitate the efficient identification of deficient routes. For challenge b, we improve a route generation model and interpret the performance of the generation with tailored visualizations. For challenge c, we incorporate a conflict resolution strategy in the progressive decision-making process to assist users in evaluating the alternative routes and finding the most optimal one. The proposed system is evaluated with two usage scenarios based on real-world data and received positive feedback from the experts.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the last few centuries, the public transit bus service has become one of the most widely deployed public transportation backbones worldwide because of its flexibility and affordability. Bus routes are typically updated every 3-5 years because the travel demand of bus riders is constantly changing <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. However, revising bus routes remains difficult because a) it is hard to analyze the performance of a huge and complex bus network to determine which routes are problematic, and b) a large solution space constituted by many factors involved in the planning process <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> needs to be extensively evaluated.</p><p>Most bus networks are planned and updated manually or by analyzing small datasets based on planners' knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. Such methods can be laborious and time-consuming. To identify feasible bus routes, data-driven planning methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>, including the mathematical and heuristic ones, have been proposed to extract the routes based on predefined criteria. However, most of these methods act as a black box, generating an optimized result based on the given input data and parameters without explanations. Therefore, verifying the quality of the generated routes or adjusting the parameters to find an improved solution is difficult for domain experts. The interpretability of route generation has been further studied by Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and Weng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Rather than producing a potentially unsatisfactory route, they propose to generate a set of Pareto-optimal transit routes, where none of the routes is better than any other route for all given criteria. However, experts are still required to manually compare among hundreds of routes and determine the most optimal one.</p><p>In this study, we collaborated with the experts from the transportation and urban computing domains to develop a solution that facilitates efficient analysis and incremental planning of bus routes. Inspired by the urban data analytics studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>, we employ a visual analytics approach to integrate domain knowledge with the computational power of the Pareto-optimal route extraction method <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, thereby enabling the experts to interactively interpret the performance of complex bus networks and evaluate the alternative routes generated in real-time. Developing such a solution poses the following three challenges:</p><p>In-depth analysis of complex bus route networks. The performance of bus route networks must be extensively evaluated first to detect the ineffective parts that need to be replanned. However, bus route networks that operate in a large city may comprise a hierarchy of thousands of bus routes and stations, producing millions of trip records per month. Analyzing such a complex dataset for deficient routes poses challenges in the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed solution.</p><p>Interactive generation of improved route candidates. The Paretooptimal route search model <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> can be used to generate potential route alternatives to the detected deficient routes. However, the constraints provided by the model are insufficient for many practical scenarios, for example, planning the routes via a few key stops. Moreover, since the model is progressive and time-consuming, the experts need to know when the results are sufficiently good to stop the search. Effective evaluation of alternative bus routes. A large number of route alternatives will be generated with the model. These alternatives can be diverse and complicated. The experts request that they should be kept in the loop to make informed and transparent decisions. However, the volume, diversity, and complexity of the generated candidates prohibit the experts from effectively evaluating these candidates based on topologies or performance criteria to identify the most optimal one.</p><p>To address these challenges, we propose BNVA (Bus Network Visual Analytics system), a novel visual analytics system that helps bus route planners analyze and improve the performance of bus route networks. For the first challenge, we adopt a hierarchical exploration approach comprising network, route, and stop levels and propose a novel matrix view to facilitate the analysis of passenger flows and transfers; for the second challenge, we extend the model to support various constraints and integrate tailored visualizations to depict the performance of the generated routes in real-time; for the third challenge, we develop a progressive decision-making strategy based on route aggregation to help users evaluate the topologies and criteria of alternative routes. The contributions of this study are as follows:</p><p>• We characterize the user requirements in analyzing and improving the performance of bus route networks; • We extend the Pareto-optimal route generation model to support additional constraints from practical scenarios; • We develop a novel visual analytics system for bus route planning, featuring a route matrix view for passenger flow analysis and a conflict resolution strategy for progressive route decision-making; • We evaluate our approach with two usage scenarios based on a real-world dataset and received positive feedback from experts.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Transit Network Design</head><p>Transit network design is a huge and complex research topic in transportation research. Guihaire et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> divided the process of transit network design and scheduling into three parts: transit network design problem (TNDP), transit network frequencies setting problem, and transit network timetabling problem. This section mainly focuses on the related studies on the TNDP. Many data-driven methods have been developed to generate transit networks automatically based on public travel demand, which can be determined from the survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70]</ref>, transportation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and telecommunication <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> data. These methods can be categorized into mathematical and heuristic methods. Mathematical methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref> generate the transit line configuration with numeric optimization approaches, including mixed-integer linear programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Heuristic methods tackle the problem based on certain heuristics with the greedy approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, heuristic search, and genetic algorithms (GAs), such as tabu search <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>, GA variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>, simulated annealing <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and ant colony algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. However, most of these methods only generate an optimized transit line configuration balancing multiple performance criteria with the given parameters. To expand the decision-making scope with alternative solutions, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> applied a random search approach in finding a set of transit routes that do not dominate each other in terms of two criteria, namely, route time and passenger flow, with the given origin and destination stops. Weng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> elaborated on the definition of Pareto-optimal transit routes and proposed an efficient route extraction method based on the Monte-Carlo tree search.</p><p>Nevertheless, the aforementioned automated methods may generate unsatisfactory results and typically require users to laboriously analyze the results and adjust the input parameters accordingly. Several preliminary efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref> in providing interactive solutions for the design procedure have been observed in the wild, but these solutions do not involve model-assisted visual planning of transit routes. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first step toward the in-depth visual analytics of interactive bus route analysis and adjustment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Visual Analytics of Urban Data</head><p>Large-scale urban data, such as human mobility, social network, geographical, and environmental data, have been collected across cities in recent years with the advancement in data sensing and management technologies. These urban data have made efficient data-driven solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> possible for various urban problems, such as bike lane planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, ambulance location selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, and travel time estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. However, most of these methods cannot automatically produce satisfactory results <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> without domain experts in the loop because of the complicated nature of urban problems.</p><p>To facilitate the analysis of urban data, many studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref> have employed visual analytics that enables users to interactively obtain patterns and insights from complex datasets, typically with the aid of efficient computational models. These studies mainly involve the visualization of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and location properties. Time properties can be depicted with axis-based design <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>, relative time encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, and dynamic visual representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The visualization of location properties can be categorized into the point-, region-, and line-based techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>. Point-based techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref> represent the locations with the points in their spatial contexts. Region-based techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72]</ref> render the aggregated location data based on certain spatial divisions. Line-based techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73]</ref> encode the locations based on road or traffic networks with line-based representations. Besides, other properties involved in the urban visual analytics studies, such as numbers and texts, can be presented with their corresponding visualization techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>. Furthermore, various techniques, including spatiotemporal <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref> and multivariate <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> visualizations, have been developed for the visualization of multiple properties combined.</p><p>With the aforementioned visualization techniques, urban visual analytics studies have explored various data sources, such as human mobil-ity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref>, social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>, environmental <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74]</ref>, and transportation data <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref>. Andrienko et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> comprehensively summarized the prior studies on transportation data and categorized these studies into three directions, namely, transportation infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>, transportation user behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, and transportation modeling and planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>. Transportation data can be also used in studying place connectedness combined with novel visual analytics techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. However, whether visual analytics can facilitate the efficient planning of bus transit routes remains to be elucidated. In this study, we tackle this problem by combining the visualization techniques for the time and line-based location properties to provide an overview of bus network performance and enable users to interactively evaluate alternative bus routes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">BACKGROUND</head><p>In this section, we show the formulation of the bus route planning problem and summarize the identified domain requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Problem Formulation</head><p>In the past year, we collaborated with four domain experts (EA-ED) working on a bus network improvement project for a large city with over 7 million residents. EA and EB are urban computing experts who have been studying sophisticated data-driven solutions for urban problems in the last few decades. EC is a data scientist in charge of developing a route optimization model for the bus network improvement project, and ED is the project manager of this project. The goal is to find an improved bus route network that meets the travel demand of citizens.</p><p>An extensive literature review <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> reveals that most data-driven methods focus on creating a new optimized route network from scratch. However, such methods are impractical in our scenario because replanning the entire network will significantly disrupt commuters' daily routines. By working with the domain experts, we constructed a threestage iterative workflow for analyzing and improving bus networks: Stage Exploration: At this stage, the experts aim to explore the performance of the bus network and determine ineffective routes. The ineffective routes may exhibit several characteristics, such as low passenger flows (few passengers will take these routes, leading to the waste of public transportation resources), high service cost (these routes are costly to maintain mainly due to long service time and frequent scheduling), and poor route directness (the transit distances on the buses are considerably longer than the road distances). The analysis of the existing bus network is based on the historical bus trip records. Stage Manipulation: After an ineffective route is determined, the experts would like to obtain its replacement routes. The Pareto-optimal route search method <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> is selected because of its capabilities in generating alternative routes on the approximated Pareto front based on multiple performance criteria. However, the original method is progressive without indicating the quality of the current results in real-time. Therefore, this stage aims to allow users to intuitively specify route generation constraints and determine when the generated routes are sufficiently good to terminate the search process. Stage Evaluation: Given a set of Pareto-optimal route alternatives, the experts aim to determine the improvement of the generated routes, make trade-offs between the performance criteria, and determine which alternative route is the most optimal. Considering that each alternative route is a graph that shares some nodes with other routes, analyzing the similarities and differences between these routes with hundreds of the routes generated becomes increasingly challenging. Hence, this stage aims to facilitate intuitive multi-criteria comparison and decisionmaking of alternative routes with tailored visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Data Description</head><p>The proposed system is based on three types of data, namely, bus stop, route, and trip data, collected from bus networks.</p><p>• Bus stop data comprise the bus stops in a city. Each stop is defined by its ID, name, and coordinates. • Bus route data comprise the bus routes, where each of them is identified by its ID and a stop sequence.</p><p>• Bus trip data contain a series of bus fare card records, where each of them comprises a card ID, a tap-on timestamp, and the route and stops where the fare card was tapped on and off. However, the tap-off timestamps are not present in the dataset because of sensor errors. This timestamp was inferred either by using the tap-on timestamps at the destination stops if such transfer records exist, or based on driving time along the bus route at 20 km/h plus 2 min spent at every stop, as suggested by our domain experts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Requirement Analysis</head><p>To develop a feasible and practical approach for analyzing and improving bus networks with visual analytics, we followed the nested model for visualization design and validation <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> to characterize the domain problem and identify the low-level analytical requirements. Based on the three-stage workflow, we conducted literature reviews on the related studies, informal interviews with the experts, and brainstorming sessions with other visualization researchers to iteratively refine the workflow and compile the following analytical requirements.</p><p>Stage Exploration (P). P1: Obtain the spatial overview of the bus network and its performance. The experts requested to see a map-based overview of the bus network similar to other GIS software <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. Such an overview should help users to rapidly orient themselves in the spatial context and grasp the spatial distribution of routes. The overview should also include the visualization of the network performance to guide users in performing a drill-down analysis on the potentially ineffective routes. P2: Analyze the passenger flows of bus routes to find weaknesses.</p><p>The movement of passengers through the bus network provides key insights for the experts to evaluate the performance of the routes. For example, some parts of a route might be non-functional if few passengers were getting on or off in these parts. Therefore, intuitive visualization of passenger flows is highly demanded to facilitate the identification of deficient routes. Moreover, such a visualization should also enable the experts to analyze the transfers among multiple bus routes, which may reveal patterns to improve route design.</p><p>Stage Manipulation (M). M1: Generate a set of alternative routes based on the constraints.</p><p>The experts prefer to interact with the model and generate the Paretooptimal routes as the potential replacements of the selected ineffective route. To minimize the disruption caused by route changes, the experts may preserve several primary stops from the original route. Moreover, certain constraints, such as the construction cost and maximum route length, may be imposed on route generation. An easy-to-use interface is required for translating these constraints into the complex parameters required by the model. M2: Inspect the quality of the generated routes in real time. Considering that the model is progressive and does not stop automatically, the experts need to know when the results are sufficiently good to stop the route generation process. Hence, tailored visualizations are required to depict the current status of the generation process in real-time and provide the early quality preview of the alternative routes as the process continues. Moreover, such visualizations should allow some undesired routes to be removed from the search space to interactively guide and accelerate the search process.</p><p>Stage Evaluation (L). L1: Compare the generated routes based on topologies. To help the experts identify the most promising ones from the generated routes, the proposed system must reveal the topological similarities and differences among these routes. The experts may want to know: What stops do these two routes share? Which pair of consecutive stops is the most frequently selected? How much does a route deviate from another one by taking a detour? Integrating topological information can help experts estimate the performance of these routes and eliminate the undesired ones that share similar characteristics. L2: Compare the generated routes based on multiple criteria. The most promising alternative route should also be determined in terms of the performance criteria. However, experts may treat each criterion differently under different circumstances. For example, the distances between the stops in a suburban bus route will be considerably longer than those between the stops in a city bus route. To facilitate a judicious decision-making process, the system should enable the experts to inspect the criteria of the generated routes and identify the most optimal one efficiently with tailored ranking models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">MODEL</head><p>In this section, we introduce the route generation method that supports the visual analytics of bus route planning and propose the modification and improvements to tailor this method for the interactive analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Pareto-Optimal Route Search</head><p>This subsection summarizes the core idea of Weng et al.'s method <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> that searches Pareto-optimal transit routes based on the Monte-Carlo search tree. The Monte-Carlo search tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> is studied to search the best next move in a game. Starting from a given game state, the search repeats four stages, namely, selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation. First, the most promising state is selected. Then, a new state is created based on the estimated best next move of the selected state. Next, the game result is obtained via simulation. Finally, the estimated value of the states in the tree is updated accordingly.</p><p>Given an origin and a destination station s o and s d in a set of stations S = {s 1 , s 2 , ...}, a feasible transit route between the origin and destination stations is denoted as R = {r 1 , r 2 , ..., r n } ∈ P od , where r 1 = o, r n = d, s r i ∈ S, and P od comprises all routes between s o and s d . A set of criteria C = {c 1 , c 2 , ...} can be defined to measure the performance of a route R. We say R i dominates R j if a) R i is better than or equal to R j with respect to every criterion c ∈ C and b) R i is strictly better than R j with respect to at least one criterion. The goal is to find an optimal Pareto-set of feasible transit routes</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P = {R 1 , R 2 , ...} ⊆ P od , where R i is not dominated by R j for any R i , R j ∈ P.</formula><p>Initially, a directed acyclic station graph G od = (S, E od ) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2A</ref>) is constructed between the origin and destination stations s o and s d with the approach proposed by Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, where the edges E od among the station nodes S are given based on heuristic criteria. A search strategy is then proposed based on the following five stages.</p><p>Initialization. A state tree is initialized with a root node representing the origin station. A set of discovered Pareto-optimal transit routes P s is maintained throughout the search process. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2B</ref> shows an example state tree. The numbers in the nodes indicate the numbers of the discovered Pareto-optimal transit routes involving the nodes.</p><p>Selection. This stage aims to find the most promising node m p . Starting from the root node, the search process recursively descends in the state tree by selecting a child node with the maximum upper confidence bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, balancing between the exploration of the lessvisited and high-valued nodes. The selection stops if any neighboring station of the current node has not been added to the state tree. The selected node m p is marked in blue in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2C</ref>.</p><p>Expansion. This stage seeks to identify the most promising neighboring station of m p that is not in the state tree. All routes belonging to a node in the state tree begin with a route prefix R k = {r 1 , ..., r k } and constitute a route subspace P od (R k ). The search process estimates the gain ∆c i with respect to every criterion c i ∈ C in choosing a neighboring station s e i and its associated route subspace P od (R k ∪ {e i }) based on heuristic approaches. The details of these approaches can be found in the original paper. Thereafter, the gains are normalized and averaged for each neighboring station, and a neighboring station is randomly chosen based on the distribution of the gains. This station, marked in purple in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2D</ref>, is inserted into the state tree as a child node of m p .</p><p>Simulation. Starting from the newly inserted node, the search process recursively performs a similar selection strategy to that in the expansion stage until the destination station is reached (the simulation nodes are marked in orange in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2E</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Efficient Computation of Route Directness</head><p>Route directness <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, which measures how much the transit network distance between each pair of stations differs from the corresponding shortest road network distance, is a crucial factor to consider in the bus route planning process. High route directness typically indicates that buses take minimal detours, and passengers will spend minimal time in traveling on this route. In the expansion stage, Weng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> proposed an averaging heuristic that estimates the route directness I R of a route subspace P od (R k ) constituted by all routes starting with prefix R k = {r 0 , r 1 , ..., r k }. However, computing such a heuristic can be time-consuming because the time complexities are estimated to be O(|S| 2 ) for the expansion stage and O(|S| 3 ) for the simulation stage. To accelerate the computation, we compute I R with the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I R (P od (R k )) = 1 N r k d (( ∑ u∈R k A(u, r k )) + B(r k )),</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">A(p, q) = ∑ η(s d ) v=η(s q ) δ pv D pv , and B(q) = ∑ η(s d ) v=η(s q ) ∑ v−1 u=η(s q )+1</formula><p>δ uv D uv . η(s i ) denotes the topologically sorted index of station s i in the station graph, N uv is the number of possible paths between stations s u and s v , and δ uv and D uv are the transit network and shortest road distances, respectively, between stations s u and s v . A(p, q) and B(q) can be efficiently precomputed for every s p , s q ∈ S because they are unrelated to route prefix R k , resulting in low time complexities O(|S|) and O(|S| 2 ) at the expansion and simulation stages, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Translation of Generation Constraints</head><p>To effectively integrate the route generation model with the proposed system, the experts requested us to implement practical route constraints, including multi-stop anchoring, construction cost, and service cost, in addition to route service time, demand satisfaction, and route directness defined in the original model.</p><p>Multi-stop anchoring. The model only allows users to define the origin and destination stops. However, experts prefer to anchor several primary stops of the original route to minimize the impact on route network structure and riders' daily routines caused by route changes. Moreover, such functionality is particularly useful when only a part of a route needs to be adjusted. To achieve multi-stop anchoring, we reformulate the input of the model as a set of stop sets S = {S 1 = {s 11 , s 12 , ...}, S 2 , ...} and construct a station graph by combining the subgraphs generated in the following procedure. For each stop set  <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. The system architecture of BNVA. BNVA comprises three parts, including data storage, backend, and frontend. Data storage preprocesses the data and indexes the data with a spatial database. Backend builds station graphs and answers route generation requests. Frontend combines the exploration, manipulation, and evaluation interfaces to establish an iterative workflow for analyzing and improving the performance of bus networks.</p><p>S i ∈ S, the stops in this set will be sequentially connected as a station subgraph; and for each pair of consecutive stop sets S i , S i+1 ∈ S, a station subgraph will be generated between the last stop in S i and the first stop in S i+1 . After the full station graph is built, we test each node in this graph against the criteria proposed by Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and remove the nodes that neither belong to any stop set in S nor satisfy the criteria. Therefore, the Pareto-optimal routes generated on this graph contain all the stops in their order given in S.</p><p>Construction cost. Integrating the construction cost enables experts to specify the cost of establishing a bus route as the estimated cost per stop C s times the number of stops in this route. We propose to add a new construction cost criterion C R that measures the average construction cost of a route subspace P od (R k ) with route prefix R k = {r 1 , ..., r k }. The number of possible routes from a stop s i to destination stop s d , denoted by n i can be computed by traversing in the station graph from s i to s d . Iterating from s d back to s r k , we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">c i = 1 n i ∑ j∈E i n j (c j +C s )</formula><p>, where E i comprises the indices of the neighboring stops of s i . Hence, we have C R (P od (R k )) = c r k . The computation of this formula is efficient because the time complexity is estimated to be O(|S|).</p><p>Service cost. Service cost indicates the cost of scheduling and operating a bus route. The estimation of service cost is based on several factors including headway H (the time interval between two consecutive buses), service span T s (the period when the route is operating), one-way route service time T R , crew wage per hour C w , fuel cost per kilometer C f , and maintenance cost per kilometer C b . We choose v = 20km/h to be the average speed of buses, as recommended by the experts. Service cost C v can be derived and estimated from the route service time criterion T R :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">C v = T s H (2T R C w + 2T R v(C b +C f )).</formula></div>

Multiple simulation stages, which still use the original random strategy, are spawned in parallel for these stations. The generated candidate routes are then collected and tested against the Pareto-optimal transit route set in batch at the backpropagation stage.</p></div>

Based on the current route generation result, the users may find some stations unnecessarily included in the routes and prefer to manipulate the search space by removing such stations from the station graph. Moreover, the model should support adding stations that are not included in the station graph. The model processes such requests by first regenerating the station graph incrementally and then altering the state tree and the route set to reflect the changes.</p><p>Route pruning. The route generation model may produce a sheer volume of Pareto-optimal routes because of the increasing number of performance criteria. However, many routes can be unsatisfactory because they may perform well in some criteria but extremely poor in other ones. To eliminate these routes, we allow users to specify the desired value range for each criterion. As the search process computes the estimation heuristics (e.g., route directness I R (P od (R k ))), we use a similar heuristic strategy to estimate the minimum and maximum criterion values for each neighboring station. A station will not be chosen if its estimated value range does not overlap with the specified one. Such a pruning strategy not only integrates criterion filters into the model but also improves the efficiency of route generation.</p></div>

The frontend comprises three visual interfaces, namely, the exploration, manipulation, and evaluation interfaces. The exploration interface facilitates the performance analysis of the existing bus network, the manipulation interface enables users to interact with the progressive model, and the evaluation interface assists users in comparing among the candidate routes based on topologies and performance criteria.</p></div>

The visual information-seeking mantra <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> motivates us to develop an exploration interface that empowers the users to discover deficient routes in the network from the overview with a map (P1) to the details with novel flow matrices depicting passenger flows and transfers (P2). The alternative routes can be obtained via the manipulation interface (M1), which provides tailored visualizations of route performance to informed the users of the generation progress and the quality of route replacements in real-time (M2). The evaluation interface adopts a conflict resolution strategy that iteratively extracts the topological differences and route clusters from the generated routes to facilitate the progressive and reliable decision-making process in finding optimal routes based on topologies (L1) and performance criteria (L2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Exploration Interface</head><p>A large-scale bus network typically comprises a complex hierarchy constituted by massive routes, stops, and trips. To facilitate the identification of deficient routes, we organize the interface by the network-, route-, and stop-level analyses. For the network-level analysis, a spatial aggregation view is designed to provide a spatial overview of the entire network and help the users filter routes with spatial constraints (P1, P2). For the route-level analysis, a route ranking view is implemented to depict the performance of the routes (P1), allowing the users to find inefficient routes based on performance criteria. For the stop-level analysis, a route matrix view is proposed to visualize the passenger flows and transfers among the stops in a selected route with matrices, establishing fine-grained inspection of route performance (P2).</p></div>

The route layer draws all routes on the map in blue with opacity. However, the route layer cannot depict the network topology because of the overlapping routes. Therefore, we designed the aggregation layer to visualize the topology with an aggregation graph. Each node in the aggregation graph corresponds to a group of bus stops aggregated spatially with hierarchical clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> by balancing the number of stops in each group. These groups divide the city into transportation zones. The boundaries of these zones are computed with a Voronoi diagram <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> by unifying the polygons that enclose the bus stops inside the zones. In addition, the numbers of the routes between the zones are encoded with the link widths.</p><p>A zone glyph <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1D)</ref> is placed at the centroid of each transportation zone to summarize the key statistics of this zone. The radar chart at the glyph center encodes six averaged criteria, namely, route length (RL), number of stops (NS), passenger volume (PV), average load (AL), route directness (DR), and service cost (SC). Users can configure the visibility and order of the dimensions flexibly in the context menu. Two diverging circular distributions around the glyph visualize the amount of passenger flows by the geographical directions in which the passengers in this zone leave (green) or enter (orange). Double clicks magnify the glyphs, allowing users to obtain a clearer view of the radar charts inside. The design of this glyph is kept simple yet informative, such that the users can naturally obtain and compare the performance of different zones with a number of glyphs.</p></div>

The columns and rows of the matrix correspond to the bus stops, and the color intensity of each cell in the matrix encodes the number of passengers traveling between the stops. The color intensity is computed by normalizing the number of passengers into [0, 1] against a global passenger flow threshold, which can be changed by users. The horizon charts <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4B</ref>) visualize the number of passengers, aggregated by time, checking in or out at the corresponding stops. The visibility of the horizon charts can be toggled in the context menu to simplify the view. Three-band horizon charts are chosen over bar charts because the estimation accuracy of horizon charts is better than that of bar charts when chart height is limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In addition, the bars <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4C</ref>) encoding the number of passengers per stop are positioned to the bottom and right of the matrix. In case of long bus routes, users can right click on the matrix to select stops they wish to keep in the view. Massive transfers may indicate that the routes are not well planned and discourage the use of bus transportation <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. To visualize transfer information, we encode the number of passengers transferred to or from other routes with the opacity of the circles <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4D</ref>) next to the station names. The numbers on the circles indicate how many routes passengers have transferred to or from. The minimum opacity of the circles has been tuned to maintain the visibility of the numbers inside them. Clicking on a circle expands a list of the associated routes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4E)</ref>, each preceded by a small pie chart indicating the percentage of passenger flows transferred to or from the route. Selecting a route in the list reveals another flow matrix visualizing this route, which is aligned and linked to the original matrix <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4F)</ref>. Inspired by MatrixWave <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>, we rotate the matrices by 45°clockwise to accommodate them linearly for enhanced scalability.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Evaluation Interface</head><p>To help the users evaluate hundreds of alternative routes and identify the most optimal one, we propose an interactive conflict resolution strategy to facilitate efficient and reliable progressive decision-making among these routes. The strategy is twofold. First, the topological similarities and differences among the routes are determined with a route clustering method, and the differences between the routes when they go through different streets are grouped into conflicts. After the conflicts have been extracted, the users can interactively resolve these conflicts by iteratively choosing a cluster of routes that share a similar topology and eventually arrive at the most optimal route. To aid the users in such progressive decision-making processes, the routes and their topologies are depicted with conflict markers on the map (L1), and the criteria of the available choices are visualized in the ranking view to facilitate the analysis of route performance (L2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.1">Detecting Conflicts</head><p>The concept of conflicts assists the users in resolving the topological differences between the routes by comparing and selecting the candidate routes they prefer. However, excessive routes may lead to choice overloading <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> in such a complex decision-making scenario, prohibiting the users from identifying optimal routes. Therefore, we propose to group the routes into several clusters first and then detect the conflicts among the route clusters, such that the choices to resolve each conflict will be no more than these clusters. For example, three four-stop routes, 1-3-4-5, 1-3-6-5, and 1-2-7-5, can be grouped into two clusters matching the route patterns 1-3-*-5 and 1-2-7-5, respectively, when the number of choices is limited to two. Hence, a conflict occurs at the second and third stops as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6</ref>. If the users choose to resolve this conflict with 3-*, another conflict will be detected on the third stop; otherwise, the optimal route 1-2-7-5 is decided.</p><p>The route clustering algorithm is detailed in Alg. 1. Initially, we consider each route as a route cluster comprising only one route. First, we find the pairs of route clusters that share the most stops (cf. line 4). Then, for each pair of clusters, we compute the standard deviation of weighted criterion sums for the routes in a new cluster obtained by merging clusters whose topologies are similar to the common part of these two clusters (cf. line 7). Subsequently, the pair with the minimum standard deviation will be merged (cf. line 8) if the merge does not reduce the number of choices to one (cf. line 5). The algorithm repeats this procedure until such a merge is impossible (cf. line 6) or the number of clusters is under the given threshold β (cf. line 3). After the routes have been clustered, the conflicts can be detected by aligning all clusters in G by stop and determining the consecutive stops that are not shared among the clusters.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">EVALUATION</head><p>In this section, we present two usage scenarios and an expert interview to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Usage Scenarios</head><p>The following two usage scenarios were conducted to analyze and improve the performance of the Beijing bus network in 2013. The dataset we used comprises 11,414 stops, 653 routes, and 668,346 sampled trip records spanning across two months. We follow Jim, a transportation system analyst, to see how our system can be used in identifying deficient routes and improving these routes interactively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.1">Deficient Route Identification</head><p>After Jim loaded the dataset into the system, he saw the map was divided into several transportation zones, whose performance was summarized with the zone glyphs. The radar charts in the glyphs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1B</ref>) revealed that bus routes in the northern part of the city carried more passengers than those in the southern part (higher average load and passenger volume). He immediately noticed that one glyph <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 8A</ref>) was particularly different from others due to its imbalanced passenger flows biased heavily towards the east (outside) of the city. Hence, he selected this glyph to further analyze all routes that passed this zone. By judging from the distribution of the routes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 8B)</ref>, Jim found that the imbalanced passenger flows were because a) many rural buses were originated from this zone and headed to the east, and b) this zone mainly served as a business district, and many of its employees commuted daily between this zone and the eastern residential districts. To find potentially deficient routes, Jim applied several filters in the ranking view, including passenger flows ≥ 10,000 (eliminating the routes with poor data quality), route length ≤ 35 kilometers (eliminating long-distance rural routes), and service cost ≥ 2,000 (seeking the routes with high service costs). Nine routes that matched the criteria remained in the ranking view <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1F)</ref>. Jim inspected them individually and found the following four interesting patterns:</p><p>Route #209. The ranking view revealed that this route had the lowest average load. The matrix view <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 8C)</ref> further confirmed that the second half of this route was almost empty and non-functional due to low passenger flows. Hence, shortening such a route or removing a few intermediate stops might improve the performance of the bus network.</p><p>Route #675, #701, #715. The matrix view of these routes showed an interleaved pattern ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8D)</ref>: the stops adjacent to those with passenger flows had few passenger flows. Jim determined that this was probably because the stops were placed too close to each other, and potential passengers were absorbed by the nearest stops. Based on this pattern, these routes could be further optimized by removing a few stops to reduce the service cost and passenger waiting time.</p><p>Route #677. From the matrix view ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8E)</ref>, Jim determined that this route might be split into two because passenger flows in the first and second halves of the routes were independent. Such a pattern could also guide the scheduling of buses on this route to meet the demand in the rush hours, such as dispatching more buses to run the first half.</p><p>Route #683. In the matrix view, the hourly temporal distribution of check-out records <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1C)</ref> clearly distinguished the stops located in the business (passengers checking out around 9 a.m.) or residential (passengers checking out in the evening) areas, which indicated that this route mainly served as a commuting route. This pattern was also confirmed by the records aggregated based on weekdays. Furthermore, Jim found this route was particularly different from other ones because of the high transfer volume at the origin stop <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1G)</ref>. By expanding the transfer route list and examining the pie charts before the routes, Jim found that most passengers transferred to Route #696. He then continued to obtain the matrix of Route #696 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1H)</ref>, where he found that many passengers boarding this route at the transfer stop were heading towards the city west (from the green stop to the orange stop in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1A</ref>). They chose to transfer to Route #696 because Route #683 did not extend into the far west region of the city, where the new residential areas were located. To improve the passengers' experience, Jim suggested that more stops in the west can be added to Route #683, such that the passengers would not have to make any transfers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.2">Interactive Route Replacement</head><p>In the ranking view <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1F)</ref>, Jim ranked the routes with the passenger volume and service cost criteria combined and discovered that Route #715 performed worst due to its low passenger volumes. By checking the matrix view <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Fig. 9A)</ref>, Jim found that the second half of this route was not functional because this part of the route largely overlapped with a metro line. Hence, after observing the map, Jim decided to optimize this route by rerouting it towards the south, such that the route would pass through a tourist attraction (Temple of Heaven) and two hospitals. Jim selected the part of the route to be optimized and anchored two stops on the map <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Fig. 9J)</ref>, one at the north gate of the Temple and another one near the hospitals. He then started the model and observed the route generation progress in the ranking view. The generation was terminated as the distributions of criteria stabilized, leaving 132 alternative routes in the ranking view. We show how Jim decided the most optimal route progressively with the following four steps.</p><p>Step 1. Jim obtained two conflicts and four route clusters from the ranking view <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Fig. 9E)</ref>. He observed from the boxplots that the third cluster had the largest passenger flows. This cluster mainly followed the original route and satisfied the stop anchoring constraint by taking two detours <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Fig. 9F)</ref>, resulting in particularly low route directness. Therefore, Jim inspected the first two clusters, which had the second-largest passenger flows, and found these clusters shared similar characteristics in terms of performance criteria. He then examined these two clusters on the map and identified that the routes in the first cluster would stop at the east gate of the Temple and a nearby metro station <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Fig. 9B)</ref>, gaining potential passenger flows. Hence, the first cluster was selected.</p><p>Step 2. After the selection, the ranking view <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Fig. 9G</ref>) presented another two conflicts with three clusters, one of which comprised only a route. The third cluster had the most passenger flows and provided more diverse choices compared with the first and second because the routes in this cluster were connected with the metro line 14 via the stop illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 9I</ref>. Therefore, Jim proceeded with this cluster.</p><p>Step 3. As the decision-making process continued, one conflict with two clusters was depicted in the ranking view. The difference between these two clusters shown on the map <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Fig. 9C</ref>) with the conflict markers was that the routes in the first cluster stopped near a bridge and those in the second stopped at dense residential areas. Therefore, the second cluster was chosen due to its potential in attracting more passengers.</p><p>Step 4. Thereafter, Jim was presented with another three conflicts with three clusters, the first and second of which comprised only a route. For the third cluster which had the most passenger flows, the first and second conflicts indicated that the flows were obtained by taking multiple detours <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Fig. 9D)</ref>, which greatly impacted the bus riders' experience. For the second route, Jim noticed that, in the third conflict, two stops in this route were too close to each other <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Fig. 9H)</ref>, which might lead to the interleaved flow pattern. Hence, Jim concluded that the first route (the blue route in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 9J</ref>) could be the most optimal one, given its balanced topology and performance criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Expert Interview</head><p>To collect feedback from experts, we conducted structured interviews individually with four domain experts. First, we introduced the basic functionalities of the system. Then, we demonstrated the usage scenarios to show how the system can be used in detecting and improving deficient routes. Thereafter, we asked the experts to follow the think-aloud protocol and try to explore the bus network and improve a few routes with the system. Their comments during the process were recorded and analyzed. Finally, we requested them to give additional feedback on the usability and effectiveness of the system. EA spoke highly of the transportation zones and zone glyphs. "An overview of the bus network is clearly given," commented EA. EB shared similar opinions with EA, saying that transportation zones showed a clear structure of the bus network and also facilitated better route filtering. Moreover, EB and EC were both impressed by the matrix view. EB commented that "A lot of insights can be obtained from such a view." Furthermore, EA, EB, and ED praised the conflictresolving strategy in route decision-making, commenting that such a strategy was "intuitive", "easy to use", and "engaging".</p><p>While the experts confirmed the design of our system had met with their analytical requirements, they also gave feedback on how to improve the usability of the system. EA requested that the system shall allow the filters in the ranking view to be reset. EC suggested that an animated line chart showing the number of the generated routes could further help the users control the model. ED recommended adding support for additional geometry file types to enhance the compatibility with other software. The system had been improved accordingly.</p><p>To further verify the effectiveness of the proposed system, we have planned to continuously collaborate with the experts after the expert interview to deploy the system for production use and test it in realworld scenarios, which will allow us to fully evaluate the effectiveness of the system with practical use cases in the field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">DISCUSSION</head><p>In this section, we discuss the implications, lessons learned, limitations, and future work of the proposed system.</p><p>Implications. This study is the first step towards the model-assisted visual exploration and planning of bus routes. In terms of techniques, BNVA comprises novel visualizations and decision-making strategies to facilitate the improvement of bus routes. In terms of evaluation, the usage scenarios indicated several abnormal route patterns that may provide insights for the bus network planners and guide the design of effective bus routes in the future. In terms of applicability, the progressive decision-making strategy proposed in this study can be applied to many urban planning scenarios, where the overwhelming number of choices will be reduced to help users make decisions judiciously.</p><p>Lessons learned. We present two design lessons we have learned while developing BNVA. First, hierarchical exploration is mandatory for complex data like bus networks. The complexity of bus networks not only lies in the horizontal (network size) and vertical (zones, routes, and stations) scales of the networks but also emerges from the association between the networks and other data sources, such as passenger flows. In this study, we employed a hierarchical exploration approach to dissect a network with multiple coordinated views from the overview to the details and provide visual hints for the users to drill down in the dataset and find interesting patterns. Second, progressive decisionmaking techniques can be useful in reducing the difficulties in making complex decisions. Excessive choices may overwhelm the cognitive capability of users. In the evaluation interface, we propose a progressive decision-making strategy that assists the users in comparing and evaluating the generated routes through choice aggregation. Users can eliminate a large number of choices efficiently because the choices that share similar characteristics are aggregated. We observed that the experts rapidly adapted to such a strategy and gave positive feedback.</p><p>Limitations and future work. Two limitations are observed in this study. First, the route generation model does not consider route shape requirements. Although circular routes can be planned by adding multiple anchored stops, direct support of specifying route shapes will facilitate design flexibility. This functionality can be achieved by integrating route shape optimization, which we will leave as a part of the future work. The second limitation involves the scope of our study. Planning an optimal and practical bus route not only requires optimized spatial structure but also a well-designed timetable and crew assignment. However, this study primarily focuses on the spatial optimization of the existing routes. In the future, we plan to implement other planning stages to establish a complete pipeline of bus network design.</p><p>There are some other potential future directions. BNVA is highly extensible in supporting customized quantifiable criteria. Additional data sources, such as traffic data and other transportation networks, can be incorporated to improve the performance of alternative route extraction and evaluation. Some machine learning approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> may improve the performance of route generation. Furthermore, integrating choice recommendations in selecting the optimal routes will considerably improve the efficiency of decision-making. Such integration will be studied in the future to facilitate spatial decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">CONCLUSION</head><p>This study presents BNVA, a novel visual analytics system that helps experts visually explore bus networks, identify deficient routes, obtain candidate routes, and determine the best alternative. The exploration, manipulation, and evaluation interfaces are designed to tackle three identified challenges, namely, the in-depth analysis of complex bus route networks, the interactive generation of improved route candidates, and the effective evaluation of alternative bus routes. The proposed system has been evaluated with usage scenarios and expert interviews based on real-world data. In the future, we will implement additional route generation criteria and expand the capability of BNVA by integrating scheduling and resource management functionalities.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The interface of BNVA.
