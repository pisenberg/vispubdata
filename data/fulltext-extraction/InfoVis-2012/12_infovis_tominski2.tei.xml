<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Visual comparison tasks take a central role in visual data exploration and analysis. By comparing and relating different parts of the data in detail, users may formulate, confirm, fine-tune, or reject initial hypotheses, and thus can gain a better understanding of the data.</p><p>Gleicher et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> argue that appropriate support is needed to facilitate visual comparison in information visualization. Existing solutions support comparison tasks mainly by visual means, including special visual encodings (e.g., visualization of differences) and special visual layouts (e.g., side-by-side views). Because visual exploration is a dynamic process where users repeatedly identify parts of the data to be compared, it is also necessary to provide dedicated interaction support. With this work, we contribute a novel interaction concept and supplementary visual cues and add-ons to support visual comparison. Our concept has been designed so as to facilitate three phases common to most comparison tasks: (1) selection of pieces of information to be compared, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> arrangement of the pieces to suit the comparison, and (3) carrying out the actual comparison.</p><p>The approach we present here is inspired by real world interaction as people may perform it when comparing information printed on paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. In an initial step, people usually pick from a pool of papers a few sheets to be studied in detail. Common ways of comparing the selected sheets are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>. One approach is to lay out the sheets side by side and look at them alternately. Additionally, when comparing graphical depictions such as line drawings or simple charts, people may stack a few sheets of paper and hold them against the light to let the information hidden on the back sheets shine through and merge with the information on the front page. Alternatively, when comparing such overlapping, but in other respects well-arranged prints, people often fold pages back and forth in quick succession without otherwise disturbing the arrangement to reveal and relate the information shown on the different sheets. These behaviors can be observed in a multitude of scenarios, for example when friends compare photographs, when decision makers contrast figures and tables in reports, or when artists draw the frames of cartoon animations.</p><p>Our goal was to design interaction techniques for visual comparison that resemble these natural behaviors as closely as possible.</p><p>The proposed solution enables users to dynamically specify pieces of graphical representations as the visual objects to be compared. We call these visual objects views. Depending on the data and the task, users can arrange views freely on the screen, for example to put them side by side or to let one view lie on top of another, if this better suits the comparison. To support users in comparing overlapping views we provide the shine-through and the folding interaction techniques. Supplementary tools help users manage the views and indicate computed differences to assist in the data analysis where possible. Our approach is generally applicable and can be combined with existing visualization solutions. Design requirements and goals, and the corresponding solutions integrated in our approach will be described in detail in Section 3.</p><p>We expected that our novel interaction techniques are intuitive thanks to their real-world origin. The anticipated benefit for the users is that comparison tasks feel natural and hence are easy to accomplish. In Section 4, we present the results of a user study indicating that the developed solution meets our expectations. In the first part of the study, the participants were able to quickly learn how to use the new interaction techniques. In the second part, we studied the developed techniques for selected visualization scenarios and found that they indeed facilitate the addressed tasks.</p><p>In the next section, we will first introduce the general background of our work and briefly review related approaches from the literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PROBLEM DESCRIPTION AND RELATED WORK</head><p>Let us begin with a motivating example that dates back to a collaboration with scientists from the bio-informatics department. The scientists visualized clustered multivariate data in a table lens, which enabled them to spot local trends and patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. For comparing the local phenomena, the scientists extensively used manual scrolling and had to rely on their short-term memory. First they scrolled to a pattern and memorized it and then they navigated to another pattern and compared that to the stored mental image of the first one. The scientists experienced this procedure as inefficient because it requires to scroll over and over again, and as error-prone because the actual comparison is carried out based on a mental image.</p><p>So, our goal was to come up with a concept that would allow the scientists to conduct the comparison more efficiently. This specific goal of supporting the comparison of local phenomena in a table lens can be translated into the more general goal of providing interaction support for visual comparison for a wider range of visualization techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Problem Description</head><p>What precisely do we mean when speaking of visual comparison? Andrienko and Andrienko <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> provide formal definitions of several variants of this visualization task. In a most general interpretation, comparison can be understood as the task of formulating a relationship that holds for particular subsets of the data. On the other hand, relation seeking is the task of searching for subsets in the data that match with a predefined relationship. According to this thinking, the only difference between comparison and relation seeking lies in what is given and what is sought (relationship or data subsets). Hence, many practical solutions do not make this distinction between comparison and relation seeking, but subsume both tasks under the common term visual comparison. So do we in this work.</p><p>For exploratory data analysis, the distinction between comparison and relation seeking is further blurred, because there are usually no apriory assumptions neither about the data subsets to be compared nor about the specific relations to be tested. In such a setting, users may at all times identify interesting data subsets to be studied in detail (e.g., individual data values or clusters of values) or potential relations to be tested (e.g., comparison of outliers, comparison of the slopes of trends, or comparison of the shapes of clusters). The actual comparison can mean that users formulate a relation based on the data (e.g., a set of values exceed a threshold) or that they confirm or reject a supposed relation (e.g., the cluster shapes are indeed identical).</p><p>This multitude of aspects makes developing general support for visual comparison a challenging endeavor. Therefore, we simplify the problem by abstracting from the specific details of the data to be compared, be it tuples in a table, nodes in a graph, sequences of genomes, or whatsoever. Our assumption is that suitable visualization techniques are available to generate appropriate visual representations of the data. Under this assumption we can resort to pieces of graphical information as the visual objects to be compared. Delegating the task of dealing with the specific semantics of the data to the visualization allows us to focus on the design of the interaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Related Work</head><p>As previously described, we aim to develop interaction techniques that support users in visually comparing pieces of graphical information. Work that is related to this goal will be briefly surveyed next.</p><p>Interaction in Visualization Spence <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> describes visualization as a tool to support people in forming mental models of otherwise difficult-to-grasp complex data. The fact that people form mental models implies that interacting with the visual output and with the data is a vital aspect. The importance of interaction has been advocated by several researchers, including Thomas and Cook <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, Pike et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, and Fekete <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. We understand our work as a contribution to the interaction side of visualization.</p><p>There are a variety of reasons why users want to and need to interact. Yi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> categorize seven key user intents for interaction. These intents are supported by a large number of available interaction techniques, where direct manipulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> appears to be the preferred underlying design. Among the available techniques are classic brushing and linking to mark interesting parts in the data (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>), navigation techniques to assist users in exploring larger information spaces (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>), techniques to manipulate the layout and adapt the encoding of visual representations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>), or interactive lenses to provide locally adapted information where it is needed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>). <ref type="table">Tasks Due to its central role, visual</ref> comparison is addressed by a number of approaches. Here we can list only a few examples. Munzner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> focus on guaranteed visibility to support the comparison of hierarchically organized data. Holten &amp; van Wijk <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> use bundled edges to explicitly link similar regions in the data. Tominski et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> support the comparison of multivariate data in general by specifically designed color-scales. Jiang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> support comparison across application boundaries by integrating multiple views in a single shared display.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Support for Comparison</head><p>Far more examples are given by Gleicher et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, who list over 110 references in a survey on visual comparison for information visualization. To establish a meta view of this immense solution space, Gleicher et al. propose a general taxonomy of visual designs for comparison (which also abstracts from the concrete data being compared). The three fundamental categories in this taxonomy are juxtaposition, superposition, and explicit encoding, which can further be combined to form hybrid approaches.</p><p>Although Gleicher et al. focus on visual techniques, they also mention interaction as invaluable tool to assist in the comparison. Two general examples of commonly provided functionality are given: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> techniques to make connections between related objects (e.g., interactive highlighting) and (2) techniques to reorder and rearrange objects. These two examples correspond to the connect and the reconfigure categories of Yi et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> taxonomy of interaction intents.</p><p>Interestingly, Yi et al.'s work does not contain a separate category for interaction techniques for visual comparison. The authors argue that to compare something can mean so many different things, making it difficult to uniquely distinguish comparison tasks from other interaction intents. We could not single out interaction techniques that are explicitly designed to support visual comparison either. Often the interaction techniques are tightly integrated as part of the visualization. Our approach is different in that we aim to abstract from the particular type of a visualization and focus on a general interaction concept, thus filling a gap in the literature.</p><p>Yi et al.'s argumentation is also an indicator that a single technique alone will not suffice to support visual comparison. Instead, multiple interaction techniques need to work in concert to support all the aspects of visual comparison. Our solution accounts for this requirement by combining interaction techniques inspired by natural behavior and supplementary visual cues and add-ons.</p><p>Naturally inspired interaction One can find different themes in the literature that address naturalness as a key to efficient interaction between the human and the computer. A classic and still relevant theme is direct manipulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, that is, the direct interaction with the graphical representation on the screen. Tanglible interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> is based on more natural interaction with tangible objects in the real world. Instrumental interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> conceptualizes the idea of naturally using interaction instruments to manipulate domain objects.</p><p>Reality-based interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and natural interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> are the next steps in a line of recent developments that include aspects of greater awareness of the user and the environment in which the interaction takes place. Typically such interactions are applied in scenarios with large or multiple displays, where awareness is achieved through detection and tracking approaches (e.g., detection of hand gestures <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> or tracking of position and viewing direction of the user <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>).</p><p>Also notable is the recent progress in utilizing interactive surfaces to facilitate visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The advantage of multi-touch surfaces is that the interaction is intuitive because it is much like working with objects on a table. One particularly related instance is Isenberg and Carpendale's <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> work on collaborative comparison of trees.</p><p>Although the inspiration for our solution comes from natural behavior, we should clearly distinguish our work from other areas that strive for naturalness in interaction. The bulk of visualization applications still resides in the realm of desktop computers, where expensive tracking systems and multi-touch devices are not yet commonplace.</p><p>Therefore, we aim to develop a general interaction concept. We think that being independent of the underlying technology is beneficial, as it allows for later implementation of the concept in different contexts using the technology that is most suitable, be it natural interaction, multi-touch interaction, or classic mouse and keyboard interaction.</p><p>Nonetheless, we hope that the novel approach presented next contributes to more naturalness of interaction in visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">INTERACTION SUPPORT FOR VISUAL COMPARISON</head><p>In the following, we elaborate on our concept of interaction support for visual comparison tasks. Starting with a set of design goals, we develop the basic environment into which to embed our new techniques. Then each individual technique will be explained in more detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Design Goals</head><p>As mentioned before, visual comparison tasks are usually carried out in three phases: (1) selection of pieces of information, (2) arrangement of the pieces, and (3) actual comparison. Theses phases are to be supported by interaction techniques that borrow ideas from natural comparison of information printed on paper. According to this thinking, our approach has to fulfill three specific requirements R1-R3:</p><p>R1 Interactive specification of comparison objects: During exploratory analysis of unknown data there are usually no a priori restrictions on what may constitute interesting candidates for the comparison. Therefore, users must be enabled to flexibly specify what they want to compare. While we can assume that a good visualization already helps the user in spotting interesting candidates for the comparison, it makes sense to provide additional support to aid in the search (e.g., by showing aggregated differences).</p><p>R2 Interactive relocation to suit comparison: It may very well be that the candidates selected for comparison are located in different parts of the display or are even not visible at the same time (e.g., when comparing the first and the last rows of a scrollable table visualization). This can severely impede the comparison because the eyes have to travel larger distances and because the user has to temporally memorize parts of a possibly complex visual representation (see Lind et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and Alvarez &amp; Cavanagh <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). Therefore, the selected parts of the visualization must be relocatable dynamically to make the comparison easy to carry out.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R3 Interactive resolving of occlusion to facilitate comparison:</head><p>Even with a side-by-side layout the comparison might be demanding because the eyes still have to move from one part to the other part. To minimize the eye movement, the objects being compared ideally would have to be superimposed one on the other. But in this case, the occlusion of possibly relevant graphical information can be disadvantageous. Therefore, appropriate interaction techniques are needed to dynamically unhide occluded parts. Fulfilling this requirement will enable the user to balance the comparison process in between the extremes: much eye movement vs. no eye movement and no occlusion vs. full occlusion.</p><p>While the requirements R1-R3 are specific to our work, there are also some general interaction goals G1-G4 we should strive to achieve: G1 Mimic natural behavior: Our major goal is to mimic real world behavior observed when people compare information printed on paper. We expect that building upon a natural origin is beneficial for interaction support for visual comparison tasks. Achieving this goal requires developing a realistic look &amp; feel. The major challenge will be to design the approach so that it bridges the gap between the natural interaction and the interaction modalities available on computer machinery.</p><p>G2 Foster fluid interaction: A second goal is to design the approach so that it is easy and enjoyable to use, where "easy" and "enjoyable" can be associated with usability and user experience, respectively. A related aspect is what Elmqvist et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> recently coined "fluid interaction for information visualization", which comprises aspects of promoting flow, direct manipulation, and smooth interaction-feedback cycles.</p><p>G3 Provide computed assistance: Third, we strive to go beyond what is possible in the real world and provide "computed" assistance. Our solution is to be complemented with appropriate tools that help users in accomplishing comparison tasks. However, the augmentation should be balanced and must not interfere with the aims for naturalness and fluidity, which forbids integrating computationally complex calculations.</p><p>G4 Promote generality: Finally, we aim to develop an approach that is general in terms of applicability. We do not seek a solution for a particular visualization technique, but one that can be combined with many of the exiting visualization methods. Generality should also be achieved with regard to the technical realization.</p><p>That is, our approach should be implementable for different interaction modalities such as mouse and keyboard interaction or multi-touch interaction.</p><p>With the specific requirements R1-R3 and the general goals G1-G4 in mind we designed the basic setup for our solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Basic Setup</head><p>As our inspiration originates from natural work with sheets of paper, we need a corresponding virtual paper representative on the computer. For the sake of simplicity we define such representatives as 2D views that show a graphical representation of data, where we do not impose any particular restrictions on the type of graphical representation.</p><p>Much like in the real world, we need a work space in which views can be compared or analyzed for relations. In accordance with our design goals, we decided to build upon the notion of zoomable user interfaces (ZUIs). In addition to being engaging, visually rich, and simple, ZUIs facilitate overview and detail exploration of the information displayed in the views (see Bederson <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>). In this work, we define the visualization space as a virtual zoomable 2D space. This space can hold an arbitrary number of views. In a sense, we combine the advantages of ZUIs and multiple views (see Wang Baldonado et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>) in a way similar to what was suggested by Plumlee and Ware <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref> shows an example of the visualization space with five views. For the purpose of illustration, the figure shows different and not necessarily related visual representations.</p><p>The classic way of navigating in such a visualization space is to apply zoom and pan operations. However, when multiple views are scattered across the space at different locations and zoom levels, manual navigation can be time consuming and cumbersome <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Therefore, we integrate automatic navigation methods that enable the user to quickly travel between views without having to approach them manually. Our solution uses the smooth and efficient zoom and pan animation by van Wijk &amp; Nuij <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> and the infinite grid by Tominski et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> to help maintain user orientation when larger distances need to be covered.</p><p>This setup of views residing in a zoomable and animated visualization space is the basis upon which we develop the interaction techniques to facilitate visual comparison.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Flexible Specification</head><p>According to requirement R1, users must be enabled to specify which pieces of information they want to compare in detail. In the real world, people simply pick sheets of papers, notes, or photos depending on the task at hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. In a regular visualization, the user has to identify and shape regions of interest mentally and keep the extracted information in mind throughout the course of the comparison, which can be quite difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Our solution relieves the user from keeping too many things in mind: At any time during the exploration of the data, if the user spots something interesting it can be marked and the system creates a new view (a sub-view so to say) corresponding to the selection. Once created, a view is detached from its base view and shown as a full-fledged view in the visualization space. All views are collected in a view hierarchy, which stores the parent-child relationships of the views. This hierarchy enables us to keep track of created views, to maintain data integrity when views are removed, and to keep views visible on top of their parents.</p><p>The actual specification of a new view is based on drawing a selection shape (e.g., an elastic selection rectangle for our case of rectangular views) on top of an existing view. The selection shape is used to determine what to display in the new view. The selection can take effect in image space or in data space. For image-based view creation, the new view simply shows a copy of the graphical content within the selection shape. For data-based view creation, the selection shape is projected into the data space, where it is used to filter out all data that do not correspond to the selection. Only the selected data are then set as the input to be visualized in the new view. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> on the first page shows rectangular views extracted from a node-link diagram. Because the selection was made in image space, we still can see edges that connect to nodes outside of the view. If we had used a data-based selection instead, the induced subgraph corresponding to the selection would not contain these edges.</p><p>Our flexible specification mechanisms contribute to fulfill requirement R1. They have a clear advantage over natural paper comparison, where extracting and duplicating information is usually more complicated (e.g., create a hard copy and cut out pieces of interest). Next we provide the details on three interaction techniques that address the requirements R2 and R3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Interactive Arrangement</head><p>Traditionally, visual comparison is supported by showing the information to be compared in a fixed layout (i.e., juxtaposition or superposition in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>). Our solution is different in that we allow users to flexibly create layouts that best suit the comparison at hand. By simple drag and drop interaction users can arrange views in the visualization space as if they were shifting paper on a table.</p><p>In addition to translation, which is mandatory for side-by-side comparison, rotation and scaling can be useful, depending on the application scenario. For example, collaborative comparison on interactive surfaces requires rotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. If comparison on different scales of the data is semantically meaningful, it can be useful to scale views independent of the already available zooming of the visualization space.</p><p>While fully flexible arrangement can be advantageous, it can also be tedious to control. In the real world, people use edges of papers or patterns on the table surface to guide the arrangement. In the virtual world, so-called snapping assists in the alignment of views to be compared. Depending on the data and the applied visualization technique, a number of alignments make sense, including grid-based, axis-based, object-based, and image-based alignment.</p><p>Grid-based alignment constrains the horizontal and vertical translation to multiples of a grid width and a grid height. This is useful for visualizations that construct regular arrangements of the data. Examples are matrix representations of graph data or table-based representations of multivariate data, where the matrix or table cells define the grid.</p><p>Axis-based alignment is useful for the many visualization techniques that display data along axes, where fixed (e.g., Kiviat graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>) or flexible layouts (e.g., FLINA <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>) are possible.</p><p>Object alignment is useful when comparing visual representations that contain visually distinguishable objects, such as glyphs, or clusters of nodes in a node-link diagram. If sufficient information (e.g., coordinates, object geometry, or bounding shapes) is available, one can employ the techniques by Bier <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> to compute a variety of guides to drive the snapping.</p><p>Where this is not the case, and in all other situations where plain image data is the only source for the snapping, image-based methods can be applied. Line detection, feature point detection, or difference images are simple examples. More complex mechanisms such as the gradient-based snapping by Gleicher <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> can provide better alignment assistance.</p><p>By providing the mechanisms for interactive arrangement we fulfill requirement R2. Users can place views side-by-side if it suits the data and tasks at hand. As with natural comparison of paper, it is also possible to let views overlap partially or to position views exactly on top of each other. However, the resulting occlusion renders any comparison impossible. Therefore, requirements R3 demands that users are provided with tools to look "through" or "behind" views.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Shine-Through Interaction</head><p>In the real world, it is quite common to purposely stack papers on top of each other and to resolve the occlusion by holding the papers against the light. The degree to which information shines through is controlled by altering the viewing direction with respect to the light source or by controlling the luminance of the light.</p><p>A common approach to momentarily reveal otherwise occluded information on a computer display is to apply see-through techniques (see Bier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>). We allow the user to temporally fade out views by alpha-blending with a variable level of transparency.</p><p>There are two ways to steer this process: the user can control the transparency manually or the fading animates automatically between fully visible and invisible. The former solution offers more control, but is more expensive in terms of interaction costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> as it requires entering a concrete alpha value. The animation is less expensive as it only requires triggering the animation (e.g., press button to fade out and release button to fade back in), but this also means less control. The time costs involved when rendering the animation can be restricted by choosing different animation speeds.</p><p>Designed in this way, the shine-through interaction fulfills requirement R3 and it corresponds to natural comparison behavior G1. In line with our experience from the real world, we found the shine-through quite useful, especially when comparing visualizations that employ the visual variables size, length, position, and orientation to encode data.</p><p>But there are also some issues related to alpha-blending. The first thing that comes to mind is the unfavorable blending of colors when comparing color-coded visual representations. An alternative solution would be to use weaving as suggested by Hagh-Shenas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> or Luboschik et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. However, with both blending and weaving another problem persists: it is difficult for the user to figure out which of the views being compared contributes to a particular feature in the blended or weaved image. This is only natural, because blending and weaving favor a merged view on the data at the cost of loosing separability of individual data items. The folding interaction described next addresses this aspect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Folding Interaction</head><p>Folding back and forth to reveal information shown on different pages is a natural behavior when comparing overlapping pieces of information. This inspired us to develop an alternative interaction technique for comparing subjects that are superimposed one on the other. To uncover occluded information we allow the user to temporarily fold away or peel off views as if they were virtual paper.</p><p>Folding has been applied successfully for other purposes related to coping with occlusion (requirement R3). Beaudouin-Lafon <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> suggests using folding to assist in window management. Dragicevic <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and Chapuis &amp; Roussel <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> extend the basic folding to support drag and drop as well as copy and paste operations between overlapping windows. Furthermore, many online brochures allow users to flip pages, mainly for the purpose of being an engaging and fun-to-use website, which is related to our goal G2.</p><p>According to our research, the application of folding to support visual comparison in the realm of visualization is novel. Therefore, we describe it in a bit more detail in the next paragraphs.</p><p>The advantage of using folding for comparison is that the occluding view can be folded away temporarily, while otherwise keeping the views in place to preserve the arrangement initially created for the comparison. We designed the folding so that it occurs where the focus of the user is, usually determined by a primary pointer (e.g., mouse cursor or touch by index finger). To resolve the occlusion at that location (i.e., the folding point P), the user simply presses a trigger to initiate the folding interaction. This is in contrast to common folding implementations, where the user has to move the pointer to grab an edge or corner in order to fold. We consider this harmful because such a movement disrupts the user's focus. Moreover, it could very well be, that the edges or corners of a view residing in our zoomable visualization space are not visible at all, making a corner-grab-based folding infeasible.</p><p>Computing the folding geometry As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>, our solution folds directly at the folding point P, taking into account a folding origin O and a folding anchor A. In the real world, the folding origin O corresponds to the spot where we grab a page for folding it. The anchor A is the virtual counterpart of the fixture around which the paper is folded (e.g., a staple or the binding).</p><p>Because we do not want to force the user to move the pointer to either of the borders of the view to initiate the folding, we developed a simple heuristic to define O and A based on P as follows. First, we define a set of candidate points on the border of the folded view, where each such candidate has a corresponding point on the opposite side of the view (e.g., the corners and the centers of the edges). The second step is to compute the distance of P to each of the candidate points. We choose the closest candidate point as the folding origin O and the point that is opposite to it as the folding anchor A. Finally, the folding axis is constructed as a line originating at P and being perpendicular to the line PA.</p><p>If a secondary pointer is available (e.g., in multi-touch scenarios), there is no need to apply the heuristic. Instead, the primary and secondary pointers can be used to define the line PA directly, and with it the folding axis.</p><p>Using the folding axis, we can compute polygonal shapes v f old and v f ix that correspond to the folded part of the view and to the part that remains fix. Further, v f old is reflected in the folding axis to create the shape v f old representing the folded backside of the view. These shapes are needed to render the folding effect.</p><p>Rendering the folding effect The goal of the folding is to unhide the information that would otherwise lie underneath v f old . To this end, when rendering a folded view, the visualization is cropped at the edges of v f ix , effectively leaving v f old blank. To generate appropriate visual feedback for the folding interaction, it is necessary to display the folded backside v f old instead. The visual effect of folded virtual paper can be achieved by rendering a white backside and attaching a shading gradient to the folding axis, which gives the fold a more realistic appearance.</p><p>However, this basic approach, although being quite natural (goal G1), is not very efficient, because it leads to self-occlusion (and possibly to occlusion beyond the folded view) without utilizing the screen space occupied for the backside for any additional gains. Therefore, we designed alternative rendering styles that aim to either use space more efficiently or reduce the occupied space.</p><p>The first alternative style enhances the visualization by utilizing v f old to display additional information (e.g., a reflected copy of the front side, an alternative visual encoding of the data, or an explicit representation of differences). The second style, shows v f old as semitransparent shape to mitigate occlusion, while still indicating the folding. The third style shows only the shading gradient mentioned before and thus requires minimal screen space. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref> illustrates the different rendering styles for the folding effect. We can see that the styles vary in their naturalness, informationrichness, and in the degree to which they account for occlusion concerns. By offering the different styles, we allow users choosing the one that best suits their preferences and balances the advantages and difficulties of the folding (e.g., some users might favor naturalness over information-richness, others might prefer sacrificing naturalness in favor of a minimalistic style).</p><p>Animating the folding interaction Using the computed folding geometry and the chosen style, we display the folding effect. But applying the folding in an instant once the user triggers the interaction would be unnatural. Depending on the size of v f old , the folding could affect a rather large part of the display, which is contrary to smoothness of interaction and might confuse the user.</p><p>Using a force-based animation will give the folding a realistic appearance and make the interaction easy to grasp and fluid to apply (goals G1 and G2). We model a simple spring-mass system, based on a point S, which describes the point where the spring is fixed, and a second point M, which defines a displaced mass that is attached to the spring. For each frame of the animation, we evaluate the forces affecting M and derive its new position, which we use in turn to construct the folding axis.</p><p>When the user triggers the folding, we set S = P and M = O which results in a smooth folding from the folding origin O to the folding point P. To smoothly unfold the view when the folding operation has ended, we do the inverse and set S = O and M = P. During the folding, when the user moves the folding point, S is simply updated to S = P to account for the movement.</p><p>The user can choose from three predefined animation speeds, which have been obtained by varying the spring constant, the damping factor, and the mass of M used for the spring-mass system. Note that the duration of the animation cannot be set directly, because the time required to reach equilibrium depends among other factors on the displacement. Therefore, bigger foldings take longer, but the animation is fluid and smooth at all times as demanded by goal G2.</p><p>The folding as described before is a helpful alternative to resolve occlusion (requirement R3) in situations where the shine-through interaction leads to unintended blending of information. In contrast to the shine-through, which affects a view globally, the folding interaction is focused and of localized nature. As our concept aims to be generally applicable (goal G4), both shine-through and folding will have their merits depending on the concrete application scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">Visual Cues and Add-Ons</head><p>With the tools introduced so far, we provide the essential interaction techniques required to support comparison tasks in information visualization. To increase the utility of our approach, we integrate supplementary visual cues and add-ons. The enhancements help users maintain overview and context, reduce interaction costs, and visualize computed differences.</p><p>View hierarchy overview To relieve users of keeping track of the created views and the information displayed in them, it makes sense to show an overview of the view hierarchy in a separate window (e.g., as a regular tree view as depicted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>). This display serves as an overview in which views can be annotated with captions to characterize them. According to Plumlee &amp; Ware <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> (p. 183), making annotations is related to offloading cognitive costs from the visual memory to the verbal memory.</p><p>The overview is also the place where the user can pick a view and trigger interaction shortcuts for otherwise costly interaction tasks. We provide two useful shortcuts. The go-to shortcut applies the smooth and efficient zoom and pan animation to center the visualization space's camera on the picked view. The bring-in shortcut does the inverse: it smoothly moves the picked view towards the center of the display. By using the shortcuts users can avoid repeated zoom and pan and drag and drop operations when exploring larger datasets.</p></div>

Additional tools provide further support to maintain overview and context, to simplify costly interactions, and to display computed differences.</p><p>Ghost of origin Defining and arranging views freely (requirements R1 and R2) implicate that data are separated from their immediate context. In the real world, this is related to removing the documents to be compared from their trays. Unless documents and trays are appropriately labeled, it can be difficult to maintain their connection.</p><p>To better preserve the data context in our visualization space, we support interactive highlighting of the location where a view has originally been detached from its parent. To this end, we embed ghost borders into the display to mark a view's origin in a dimmed fashion (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>). To avoid excessive overplotting, we show only the ghost borders for the currently focused view. This visual cue helps users reestablish the connection between the data shown in the focused view and the data's original context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Difference LEDs</head><p>To assist users in spotting interesting candidates for detailed comparison, additional support is desirable (requirement R1). Where feasible we provide such support by visualizing computed differences on demand.</p><p>Computing differences between views is possible, for instance, for visualizations that show data in regular cell arrangements (e.g., tabular visualization of multivariate data or matrix visualization of graph data). Where two such visualizations overlap, each cell in one view has a corresponding cell in the other view. For each such pair of overlapping cells, we compute the individual difference of their data values. These individual differences are then averaged along columns and rows to obtain a single aggregated difference value per column and row.</p><p>To visualize the column-wise and row-wise differences in an unobtrusive fashion, we embed so-called difference LEDs into the borders of views. As illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>, the differences are color-coded using a suitable color scheme. Gray color indicates that no differences were computed due to the particular overlap configuration.</p><p>When users move a view, the differences are dynamically updated depending on the current overlap situation. During data exploration, the difference LEDs provide aggregated information about the similarity of the overlapping views. Based on this information, users can decide if it makes sense to compare the underlying data in more detail using the shine-through or folding interaction; otherwise they can continue the exploration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.8">Approach Summary</head><p>In this section, we developed an ensemble of interaction techniques and supplementary tools to support visual comparison. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> provides an overview of the interaction tasks that we address and the corresponding concepts and methods integrated in our approach. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 7</ref> provides a summarizing overview of the key interactions side-by-side arrangement, shine-through, and folding.</p><p>To test our solution, we implemented an interactive prototype for visual comparison on regular desktop computers using mouse and keyboard interaction. It integrates all solutions listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. Our prototype directly supports table and matrix visualizations (e.g., bar chart table or scatter plot matrix) with different visual encodings, including • Balanced set of folding styles • Force-based folding animation color, two-tone color, size, and length. By supporting the comparison of images, we indirectly allow any kind of visualization to be integrated and tested with our concept. We used our software to compare screen captures of node-link diagrams, parallel coordinates, stacked bar graphs, as well as photos and spot-the-difference images. The interested reader can try out the developed techniques with a tabular visualization of a small dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Note that the support for snapping is currently limited to the grid-based approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">USER STUDY</head><p>For the evaluation of our techniques, the aim was to gather as much information and feedback as possible regarding the potential usefulness of the interaction techniques and on the fulfillment of the requirements and goals described in Section 3.1.</p><p>We opted for a qualitative study based on the "think aloud" method in combination with observation and a flexible interview format. Our study pursued two objectives. The first objective was to assess whether the techniques mimicked natural behaviors and if they could be applied easily. The second aimed at assessing the usefulness when using different visualization techniques.</p><p>Participants 18 persons participated in the study. They were all employees or students at a university. Among them were 6 participants (all male, ages 24-39) who judged themselves as experienced (if not experts) in visualization and 12 participants (four female, ages 19-35, eight male, ages <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> with no or little experience in this field. All participants were familiar with (if not experts) in using interactive software, but none had used our interaction techniques prior to the study. Except for refreshments, the participants received no compensation for taking part. Stimuli, tasks, and devices For the first part of the study, we embedded photographs and the pages of a research article into the zoomable visualization space. The task for the participants was to familiarize with the interface and its navigation methods, and to apply the developed interaction techniques to compare the photographs and browse the article much like in the real world.</p><p>In the second part, two common and one advanced visualization techniques were used: a table visualization, a matrix visualization, and the NodeTrix technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>The table visualization displayed bars whose lengths were proportional to the underlying data values. Each table column was shown in a saturated color that was different from the color in adjacent columns. We used random data with 12 columns and 200 rows into which we embedded 6 artificial patterns: two ideal linear trends, two noisy trends, and two correlation patterns. The single column trends spanned between 10 and 15 rows and the correlation patterns covered 4 columns and 10 rows. The participants were pointed to these patterns and the task was to compare the lengths and the slopes of the trends, and the strengths of the correlation.</p><p>For the matrix visualization, we constructed two random 100×100 matrices. We further used three random 15×15 pattern matrices, each of which contained either a square (7×7), a plus (8×8), or a slash (10×10) as artificial pattern. The three pattern matrices were embedded into each of the random matrices at varying positions to generate two test matrices. The participants were presented with the test matrices, where one matrix used a color-coding and the other a different size+color encoding. The task was to pick a pair of patterns (e.g., the plus in both matrices) and to compare the vicinity of the patterns.</p><p>For the third test, we used a more complex NodeTrix representation of a co-author network. A NodeTrix is a hybrid design that shows communities in the network as matrices and embeds them into a nodelink diagram to preserve the overall network structure. In the study, the participants were presented with <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 7</ref> from the original Node-Trix article <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and were asked to freely compare anything they find interesting in the visualized co-authors network.</p><p>While the introductory part and the NodeTrix part were more of exploratory nature, the parts with the table visualization and the matrix visualization were designed to assess our techniques' usefulness when comparing length-coded and color-coded visual representations.</p><p>The study was performed using a regular desktop computer with a 24 inch monitor and mouse+keyboard interaction. A large reference sheet with the interaction techniques was pinned to the wall so that the participants could refer to them when they needed to recall a particular mouse or key mapping.</p><p>Procedure Each individual session started with obtaining background information, including age, visualization expertise, and interaction experience (classic mouse and keyboard and modern multitouch). Then an introduction and a demonstration was given, providing an overview of the program and a step-by-step walkthrough.</p><p>Thereafter the actual study began. First, the participants were asked to explore the program freely trying out the interaction techniques working on the photographs and the pages of the research article described earlier. Second, they were asked to carry out comparison tasks using the table, matrix, and NodeTrix visualizations. Before each task, the participants were given oral instructions about the particular visualization. In order to stimulate as much feedback as possible, the participants were encouraged to use all interaction techniques. The next visualization was presented when the participants had agreed of being finished with the current task. The order of presentation of the three visualizations was not assumed to be a factor that could have any negative impact on the outcome of this evaluation.</p><p>While the participants were carrying out the tasks, the experimenter instructed them to "think aloud" meaning that they should describe what they were doing, why they were doing it, and also what they would like to do. Notes were taken to document each participant's session. During the study, a prepared interview guide was used which included a set of predefined questions that covered various aspects of the design goals and requirements from Section 3.1. The experimenter engaged in the conversation and made sure that all questions were covered. Most questions were discussed while the participants were working with the program, although some were reviewed afterwards. At all times, the participants could ask questions and ask for assistance. Total participation time lasted approximately 60 minutes, about 15 minutes each for the introductory part and the three visualizations.</p><p>Results The feedback from the participants was mostly positive. There were also useful comments on the negative side, which have already helped us to improve our solution. The evaluation of our approach according to the goals G1-G4 led to the following results.</p><p>Goal G1 All 18 participants said that the provided interaction techniques resemble natural comparison well. 6 participants commented that the interaction is "better than natural comparison", because the techniques provide more degrees of freedom and because things are easier than in the real world (e.g., cutting out and duplicating pieces of information). 12 participants commented that the folding is too flexible. They wished for constrained folding along the horizontal or vertical axes of a view. On the other hand, they recognized that constraining the folding should be optional depending on the un-derlying visual representation. One participant realized only then that he could create an exactly diagonal fold to compare the symmetric matrices in the NodeTrix much easier.</p><p>Goal G2 All participants experienced the interaction techniques to be fluid and smooth, and enjoyed using them. Several participants expressed their excitement in comments like "Oh, this looks great.", "The folding feels realistic because it follows the pointer smoothly." or "The software is nicely implemented, everything is very harmonic.". The participants' feedback also confirms that using a zoomable interface as the basis for engaging and simple interaction was an appropriate decision.</p><p>Goal G3 Although the complementary visual cues and add-ons were not in the focus of the user study, most participants considered them useful. In particular, the highlighting of a view's origin and the shortcuts were appreciated. The similarity LEDs were only rarely applied due to the nature of the tasks: The clearly described patterns to be compared made a search for comparison candidates unnecessary. 4 participants commented that an integrated overview would ease activating the short cuts.</p><p>Goal G4</p><p>We also asked the participants if they could imagine applying the interaction techniques with different interaction modalities. From the 18 participants of the study, 6 considered themselves as intermediates or experts in multi-touch interaction. All 6 of them said that the interaction would work on a touch device as well; 3 thought that it would work even better on such devices due to the natural paperon-table metaphor. One of the participants was experienced in alternative interaction modalities. She commented that applying the techniques using Wii-controllers or depth cameras in front of a large highresolution display could work as well, but the utility of the techniques might depend on the distance of the user to the display.</p><p>Given the feedback from the users, we can conclude that our approach fulfills all four goals G1-G4. The user study also yielded insight with regard to the requirements R1-R3.</p><p>Requirements R1-R3 When the participants carried out the comparison tasks for the three different visualization techniques, we observed that the assumed general procedure of (1) selecting, (2) arranging, and (3) comparing pieces of information was indeed followed by the participants. Depending on the task, all participants created juxtapositions or superpositions of the views and compared them afterwards. For superposition, the participants applied the shine-through and folding interactions to fine-tune the arrangement. When being asked if anything was essentially missing the participants answered in the negative. All participants answered that the interaction tools and visual cues supported them in accomplishing the comparison tasks easily, quickly, and with confidence (although there was no ground truth to be found). Hence, we can infer that the requirements R1-R3 are valid for interaction support for visual comparison and that our approach fulfills them.</p><p>Observations The way how participants applied the techniques suggests that side-by-side arrangement are useful when comparing smaller views (e.g., the linear trend patterns) and that superposition is beneficial for larger views (e.g., the pattern matrices). We can further infer that using shine-through is good for getting an overview of the compared views, while the folding facilitates making direct comparison of more focused regions (e.g., individual rows) in the display.</p><p>When working with the different visualization techniques, some participants noticed that the color blending of the shine-through can be a disadvantage. They compensated this by using the folding interaction. With regard to the occlusion caused by the folding, we could argue that it is not a severe problem, because we can assume that the user's attention rests where the folding uncovers hidden information and not where information is possibly about to be occluded. Yet, this argument needs to be proven experimentally.</p><p>Until then it is good to have the different styles (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref>). We asked the participants which style they found useful: the informationrich backside, the transparent backside, and the minimal backside received 15, 13, and 14 votes respectively. The blank backside received only 3 votes, although one participants explicitly acknowledged this style's naturalness.</p><p>Additional improvements The participants made a number of suggestions for additional improvements. 3 participants commented that the mouse wheel zooming works opposite to what they expected. Detailed inquiry confirmed that these participants had experience with other zoomable tools to which they were adapted. As described by Grew <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, there are competing models behind the wheel interaction, so it makes sense to allow users to choose the wheel zoom direction.</p><p>The grid-based snapping of our table visualization was critiqued as well. 9 participants said that they could not compensate for a certain offset in the value ranges when comparing the slope of trends in detail. Therefore, the suggestion was to make the snapping an optional feature, active only when a particular key is held down. Interestingly, when comparing the NodeTrix, for which we do not provide snapping, some participants commented that snapping would be needed, whereas others said that the shine-through and manual arrangement work so well that snapping is not a must.</p><p>One participant suggested that it should be possible to fix a view in place so that it can not be moved unintentionally, another recommended that dragging a view beyond the window borders should automatically activate scrolling. We consider these suggestions to be mostly details of the implementation, which can be easily fixed.</p><p>Summary Overall, we can conclude that most participants are generally satisfied with the interaction techniques and acknowledged their usefulness in comparing visual representations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>Inspired by real world behavior, we developed a general interaction concept and an implementation thereof to support comparison tasks in visualization. Our approach covers all categories of Gleicher et al.'s taxonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>: the interaction techniques facilitate juxtaposition and superposition, while explicit encoding is realized by visual cues. In this sense we can argue that our solution is a first step to complete the interaction support for visual comparison.</p><p>A qualitative study with 18 participants confirmed that the provided interaction techniques resemble natural behavior and that they are easy to apply and understand. The study indicates that the interaction works well for different visualization techniques.</p><p>Yet, we think that users should be better supported (beyond visual indication) in finding interesting candidates for detailed comparison. One idea for future work is to design viscosity-based interaction so that moving a view across other views is dependent on the similarity of the overlapping data. A view can be moved fluidly where the data are dissimilar anyway, but the movement is more viscose where it would be worth taking a detailed look due to the stronger similarity of the underlying data.</p><p>We also plan to implement our concept on a multi-touch surface and for interaction in front of a large display wall. The new implementations should consider the specifics of these environments as well as the suggestions of the participants of our user study.</p><p>A limitation of our work is that it is not entirely clear which interaction to apply under which circumstances. In the real world, shinethrough and folding are usually applied with line graphics or simple shapes (e.g., the flipping technique used by artists when creating animated comics), but not with dense graphical contents such as photos. We may conjecture that applying shine-through and folding for visual comparison in information visualization is more suitable for abstract graphical depictions than for very dense displays. However, this has to be confirmed by additional experimental studies. Therefore, we encourage controlled studies to investigate the usefulness of the interaction techniques for different classes of visualization techniques and visualization tasks beyond comparison. To this end, we will make our software available to other researchers and interested users.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Natural behaviors observed when people compare information printed on paper: side-by-side arrangement, shine-through, and folding.</figDesc></figure>
