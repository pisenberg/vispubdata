<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Computer simulations fill the gap between theory and experimentation, allowing scientists to model and study extremely complex physical phenomena in regimes where experiments are too expensive, too dangerous, or impossible to perform. In particular, scientists are interested in analyzing biological, climate, and high energy physical phenomena, which require the immense computational power that only a supercomputer provides. Such a system may consist of tens or hundreds of thousands of compute nodes, each node typically made up of several processor cores. These nodes communicate using a high speed interconnection network. To perform massively parallel simulations, nodes typically interleave local computations with communication between other nodes in the system. By working together, the nodes can perform calculations that would require millennia to perform on modern personal computers.</p><p>The most common approach to implement parallel simulations is to decompose the simulated domain, e.g., a combustion chamber, into a collection of patches which are then distributed across processes. Each process is responsible for performing the computation necessary for its local data patch and intermittently exchanges data with other processes to coordinate the global computation. In this work we primarily focus on communication using the Message Passing Interface (MPI), the most dominant model for high-performance computing communication. However, our techniques also apply to other programming models such as Charm++ <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In an MPI program, communication between processes is expressed through routines that send data between pairs or sets of processes. Given this frame of reference it is natural to analyze the message behavior as a graph of communication where nodes are processes and edges represent data exchanges. There exist a number of corresponding tools which visualize MPI communication behavior in this fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</p><p>However, this type of analysis disregards the routing of messages on the physical network hardware. Different MPI implementations, application domain decompositions, or system configurations may realize communication primitives such as global reductions or all-to-all messaging differently. Furthermore, the mapping of individual processes to cores strongly influences the network traffic because the length of message paths may vary, and the paths may interleave or interfere in complex ways. Moreover, systems like the IBM Blue Gene/P may dynamically alter the paths taken by messages. Different physical routes may even be used for different parts of a message. To fully understand these effects on the network traffic and diagnose performance bottlenecks one must instead analyze the physical packets sent on the network. Packets are units of network traffic used for routing within the hardware interconnect. Here we propose a visualization framework to illustrate and analyze the network traffic of packets on some of the largest simulations performed on modern supercomputers. In particular, we show how different process-to-core assignments affect the network traffic, and, by using carefully designed visualizations, we gain insights for optimizing the performance.</p><p>Our contributions in this work focus around the design and application of a visualization tool that explores the behavior of the network traffic. We make use of a context that is both familiar to application developers and representative of the underlying hardware interconnect. Few tools exist that directly visualize performance data using a similar context <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>, and none of these provide the flexibility or insight of our system. In particular, our approach in visualizing network traffic is to use projections of the network topology. These projections are two-dimensional and retain the intrinsic characteristics of the hardware network while illuminating communication patterns without visual clutter. We consider three-dimensional torus networks, common to many HPC systems such as the IBM Blue Gene series. Consequently, we augment this 2D view with an interactive, linked 3D view that provides a familiar context to application developers on these platforms.</p><p>Together, these linked views assist application developers in two ways. First, they allow developers to understand trends in application communication from two illustrative viewpoints. Second, application developers are able to understand the connection between the mapping of MPI processes onto nodes and the resulting network traffic in runs on massive supercomputers. We conduct case studies using our approach to evaluate the performance of pF3D, a multi-physics code used to simulate laser-plasma interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. These studies highlight the strengths of the visualization and the insights it provides to the performance experts on our team.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Visualizing interconnect traffic for performance analysis requires a combination of concepts from both the visualization and high performance computing (HPC) communities. This section first discusses the state of the art in performance analysis using network traffic data. Next, we provide an overview of visualization efforts focused on similar data modalities and techniques as well as general design principles relevant to our approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Communication Analysis to Improve Performance</head><p>With the growing popularity and complexity of parallel programming models, visualizations of communication behavior has been included into several performance tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. One of the most frequently used visualizations is that of traces of MPI messages sent. This is used in tools such as ParaGraph <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, JumpShot <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and Vampir <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Conceptually, these views are similar to Gantt charts, and consequently rarely scale well, so Muelder et al. use visualizations of MPI function call durations to improve the visualizations of MPI traces <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. These tools are interesting in part for the techniques they use, but also because of the growing availability of performance data. In many cases however, the ability to achieve performance improvements is sharply limited by the specific data that can be collected.</p><p>Prior performance tools have attempted to correlate application performance with the network traffic behavior. For example, the Tuning and Analysis Utilities (TAU) software suite <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and other tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> allow the visualization of message call timings, cumulative instruction counter values, and other per-core measurements in the context of a communication trace. TAU, Scalasca <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and Triva <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> offer embedded views of function call timings and hardware performance data directly on a 3D torus network topology, providing some notion of both communication patterns as well as descriptions of hardware resource utilization. While these tools show per-core data in the shape of the hardware network, they do not show the actual traffic that travels over the network. Thus, the user must estimate quantities such as network bandwidth based on timings; they are not shown directly.</p><p>With the advent of high-diameter Cartesian networks in HPC, understanding communication patterns has grown in importance. On such networks, the mapping of the simulated domain to network nodes can severely affect performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Bhatia et al. show how visualizing the virtual topology of an application (as opposed to the physical topology of the network) can give insights <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Raponi et al. have characterized specific patterns than occur on the Blue Gene/P series of supercomputers <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. These patterns are useful but they do not tie network behavior to its context within the simulated application domain.</p><p>As our ability to collect performance data grows, so do the opportunities for insightful visualization approaches. Modern machines such as IBM's Blue Gene series have performance counters that allow the measurement of raw traffic on links within the hardware network in addition to the traditional per-core and per-node counters. Schulz et al. propose to use hardware and network views in a holistic approach aimed to show performance data across multiple domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, and we build on this approach by tying raw network traffic to application communication structure where possible. Our linked views present performance data in contexts that afford better opportunities for insight to application developers and performance experts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Visualizations of Network Traffic</head><p>On an abstract level, network traffic in a supercomputer can be thought of as a graph of communicating processor cores as nodes connected by edges representing load on particular links of the hardware interconnect. General graph visualization has been a long standing research problem and we refer the reader to Herman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> for an excellent survey. However, most of these techniques, including hierarchical clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, projections into lower dimensional spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, topologically-driven layouts <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, or edge bundling <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, are primarily concerned with the creating graph layouts to highlight the topology of a graph. In our case, the topology of the graph-a 3D torus-is well known and creating an unstructured layout may obscure this fact. We are interested in visualizing and analyzing data on the edges of the graph while maintaining as much of the known context as possible.</p><p>In this respect our application is more akin to techniques such as past visualizations of AT&amp;T's long distance phone network <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> or the PortVis tool to display TCP traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In these cases the graph topology is known and thus a single, domain-driven layout is employed. For example, given that AT&amp;T's network consists of switches and lines in well known geographic locations, creating a corresponding, geographic graph layout is a natural solution. However, such layouts are highly application dependent. Additional work has been done in attempts to understand flow across a network by comparing graph-based flow visualization with TreeMaps for local network monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Here too, both the problem space and necessary analysis techniques are highly application dependent. Summers et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> applied existing visualization techniques to a network model of ASCI Q (a retired su-percomputer at Los Alamos National Laboratory). This work focused on visualizing fat tree networks with the goal of improving modeling techniques for future architectures rather than providing new performance analysis results. To our knowledge the work presented here is the first to visualize and explore packet-level network data with measurements from a real system for performance analysis.</p><p>Beyond graph layouts, many of the standard design principles for effective visualizations apply to our setting. It is well known that interacting with the graph through zooming, highlighting, or linked views provides significant insights <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Coordinated views have been proposed for visualizing graphs in the context of email communication networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Filtering out unnecessary details and using fisheyestyle distortion to maintain appropriate context <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> are popular techniques for graph visualization. Shneiderman provides one such survey for general practices with graphical interfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The philosophies of overview first, zoom and filter, and details on demand are good practices that we have incorporated into our visual tool. We expand upon these by augmenting with selection and interaction. In particular, we make use of interactive legends for more effective data exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. We additionally make use of color, size, and transparency to highlight important trends in the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">NETWORK PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS</head><p>The performance of many massively parallel applications is dominated by communication costs. As the degree of parallelism increases, this problem intensifies as more processors contend for communication bandwidth. To avoid scalability problems, it is paramount that developers optimize the use of the hardware interconnect. However, applications are typically written in terms of data exchanges between (groups of) processes managing portions of the simulated domain. Even for experts it is difficult to predict how a set of high level data exchanges will be expressed on the hardware interconnect, because both the messaging layer and hardware routers are free to decompose and redistribute to optimize the transfer. Our ultimate goal is to understand how and why problems such as network contention and unnecessary dependencies form, so that we can avoid them. In this section, we review the more common high level MPI communication primitives and why a packet level analysis is necessary. Subsequently, we discuss the particulars of our case study by explaining some relevant idiosyncrasies of the Blue Gene/P system and the pF3D application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Application-Level Communication</head><p>Parallel physics simulations typically decompose their domain into a collection of work units and assign the computation of each work unit to a different process in the simulation. Periodically, processes must exchange messages to fetch data that is not in local memory. One common framework for this type of communication is the Message Passing Interface (MPI), which provides developers with point-to-point and collective communication primitives (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>). As the names suggest, a point-to-point message sends data from one process to another. A collective communication involves a group of processes (such as all-to-all, broadcast and reduce), all of which must participate in the communication. In MPI, collective primitives take place using a communicator, an abstraction for a set of communicating processes. An all-to-all sends all processes in a communicator a subset of data from all other processes (this is frequently used for parallel matrix transposition). Similarly, for a broadcast/reduce, a single process sends/receives data to/from all other processes in the communicator.</p><p>However, MPI implementations rarely implement these collective communication patterns directly. Instead they use more sophisticated routing algorithms, e.g., binary broadcast trees, or they exploit special hardware features. On IBM Blue Gene/P supercomputers, for example, broadcasts can be implemented in hardware on particularly shaped partitions using a "deposit bit" allowing messages passing through a node to deliver (or deposit) a copy of the message. This leads to an almost even network traffic pattern away from the broadcast root, as seen in the <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2(c)</ref>.</p><p>While point-to-point messages are easiest to understand, even their behavior is not entirely obvious. In practice, a given process can be assigned to any of the available compute nodes and thus the way processes are mapped heavily influences how far messages must travel and whether their paths may interfere. Despite being conceptually simple, understanding how a collection of point-to-point messages interact with each other on the hardware interconnect is often non-trivial. MPI implementations add additional complexity because communication primitives may be highly optimized for specific parallel machines. The communication algorithm depends on the configuration, hardware, shape/size of the communicator, and/or the MPI library. This makes it practically impossible for application developers to predict the network traffic from non-trivial communication.</p><p>Our tool enables even non-experts to visualize packet-level traffic based on direct measurements. This provides insight into how and why particular implementation choices affect performance. Furthermore, as discussed in detail in Section 5, our tool provides an intuitive way to compare the behavior of different process-to-node mappings and a means to explain their effect on performance. As we will show, the performance of a parallel application is intimately tied to not only what messages are sent, but also how efficiently these messages can be sent along the network. This leaves application developers with the problem of node mapping, or determining how best to take a known set of processes and allocate them onto the available CPU cores of the system to balance computation and communication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">IBM Blue Gene/P</head><p>In our case study we focus on the IBM Blue Gene/P (BG/P) supercomputers, such as the "Intrepid" system at Argonne National Laboratory, "Dawn" at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and "Jugene" at Jülich Supercomputer Center, as well as numerous other systems on the TOP500 list of supercomputers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Furthermore, the BG/P successor, the Blue Gene/Q, features a very similar architecture. The first installation, "Sequoia" at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is currently the world's most powerful supercomputer. For this paper, the most relevant aspects of the BG/P's design are its 3D torus network (used by 12 of the top 100 systems as of June 2012) and its dynamic packet routing (common to both BG/P as well as 15 BG/Q systems in the top 100). In a 3D torus, each node is connected to six neighbors in 3D space through six links. Blue Gene systems dynamically route and split messages along shortest Manhattan paths within the Cartesian network (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>). The dynamic routing means that, depending on the network traffic, messages on BG/P may take any of multiple possible shortest paths. Additionally, different portions of a large messages are split and distributed among the potentially shortest paths. This makes predicting network traffic difficult. On the other hand, the network topology remains fixed as a 3D torus for practical use cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Data Collection</head><p>Despite this complexity in the hardware, a major advantage of the BG/P system is its comprehensive set of performance counters (including counters for network activity) and its sophisticated set of data instrumentation tools. These allow for the collection of performance Minimaps for giving context once user zooms in. Color based on the mean link values for the links in that plane. Three different orientations allow a user to look with perspective along the x, y, or z directions. These views also give an overview of the communication behavior.</p><p>Interactive legend for selecting range of values to be viewed. Axes showing current orientation of the view.

All diagonal links are shown, but with much shorter lengths.</p><p>The 2D view supports highlight planes on a mouseover. The 2D view also supports zooming and panning as well as node selection. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. An overview of our visualization tool, illustrating the minimaps, interactive legends and axes, 2D projected view, and linked 3D torus view. Note that in this figure, the 3D view shows only the links that are seen in the 2D view to better illustrate the projections from 3D to 2D.</p><p>data at very fine granularities, allowing the characterization of packetlevel network performance. Each node has the ability to track the number of packets sent on its six links/directions available on the torus.</p><p>To track the communication bandwidth, we directly instrument phases in application codes, and we combine this instrumentation with the P N MPI <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> tool infrastructure to intercept calls to functions in the MPI library. This infrastructure, once linked with the code, allows the dynamic loading of modules that can read hardware counters on BG/P. Our instrumentation allows us to aggregate the data from specific phases within the code, and we output sums of the network traffic that occurred over fixed spans of execution. Per-phase data gives us some temporal information without incurring unacceptable overheads. Since data collection for such a massive system is highly nontrivial, such summaries are necessary. Moreover, they are reasonable for many simulations, including pF3D, as similar communication patterns repeat at each phase. If we were to instead record full packet traces, the runtime overhead and storage requirements of our measurement system would be unacceptable, potentially producing more data than the simulations themselves. On the other hand, if we were to sum per-link communication over the entire application run, we would fail to see enough detail to identify communication patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">pF3D</head><p>pF3D is a multiphysics code designed to simulate laser and plasma interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. It provides an interesting case study as (a) it is actively used in connection with inertial confinement fusion experiments at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and (b) since it is known to scale well to some of the largest supercomputers available today. In its typical setup, pF3D uses a regular 3D process grid in (x, y, z) coordinates with the z-direction aligned with the laser. This grid is typically sized with respect to the laser wavelength, resulting in grids of billions of zones. The domain is then decomposed into a set of xy slabs perpendicular to the direction of the laser and the computation is split into solving the light equations within each slab independently followed by hydrodynamic calculations along the z-direction. The dominant cost (especially with respect to communication) is the computation within each slab, which requires solving a (separable) FFT on each plane. Thus, each slab is subdivided further into a two dimensional array aligned with the x-/y-directions of the primary grid. The FFT is solved in two phases first along the xand then the y-direction. Both of these require alternating all-to-all operations among groups of processes in a slab with the same x and y coordinate respectively. It is well known that the cost of these all-to-alls dominate the overall communication performance, so we focus our case study on providing insights into how different process-to-core mappings affect the network traffic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">VISUALIZING NETWORK TRAFFIC</head><p>Designing a visualization of network traffic for performance analysis presents a number of challenges. Given the large number of hardware links on modern networks, we need tools that can illuminate trends at multiple scales. For example, depending on the application, network contention may manifest itself in a single or very small set of overloaded links requiring detailed illustrations. Simultaneously, there often exist patterns on the level of entire planes or large blocks of processors that may only be apparent in a global overview. Our system is designed to provide sufficient context for insight into the global performance picture while allowing a detailed, interactive exploration of the data at multiple scales.</p><p>Our tool is built around two different views of the hardware domain. First, we use a set of modified central projections to show all nodes and two-thirds of the links of a system in various combinations in an intuitive, planar layout. Second, we use a more traditional 3D layout of the hardware torus that mirrors the physical network topology, yet suffers from occlusion and visual clutter problems. Furthermore, we present summary views that provide context and identify global trends, enabling quick navigation and the ability to drill down in the often large graphs. Finally, we allow a user to sub-select data based on code phases or individual communicators. Both views are linked providing highlighting of important substructures, such as planar slices in the 3D torus, and enabling joined selection and analysis. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> provides an overview of our visual tool, highlighting the strengths of the projected view and the different interaction mechanisms we include, as well as the linked 2D and 3D views described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Projected Views of the Network</head><p>We use a modified central projection, similar to the ones studied in optics and map design, to map the 3D torus of the BG/P system onto various different view directions. Conceptually, the projection is created by treating a torus viewed, for example along the x-axis, as a set of concentric, squared cylinders. For a cube shaped torus the innermost cylinder will contain a ring of four node sets extruded in the view direction, the next cylinder an extruded ring of twelve node sets, and so on. Each cylinder is then projected into a set of concentric rings which show half the links in the direction orthogonal to the view as horizontal or vertical lines of roughly equal length and all the links along the view direction as short diagonal segments. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figs. 3 and 4</ref>, for a 2 n × 2 n × 2 n torus this results in n concentric sets of 2 n rings.</p><p>While this projection creates significant geometric distortions, it also enables us to show all the nodes without occlusion and preserves much of the required context. For example, all horizontal (similarly, vertical or diagonal) links in the projection represent parallel links in the 3D torus and the different directions will be pairwise orthogonal. In this default version of the projection only half the vertical and horizontal links are shown. However, in our experiments this has usually proven sufficient to detect global patterns. Furthermore, we can easily show all existing horizontal/vertical links if we remove the links of the alternate direction completely (e.g., <ref type="figure">Figs. 1 and 6</ref>).</p><p>Another advantage of this projection is that the layout of the nodes retains a strong resemblance to their 3D arrangement. For example, as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. ?</ref>?, nodes in a horizontal or vertical band of the projection are highlighted to represent planes of the 3D torus providing an intuitive link to the original network topology. When designing this projection, there are six natural directions, each of which create six distinct node layouts. Furthermore, given that a torus has no boundary, the choice of center for the projection is arbitrary which provides a large amount of additional flexibility. In practice, however, we find that most problems tend to be symmetric and thus most of these different views provide roughly the same information. Therefore, we have currently limited the available choices to the three primary directions to avoid overwhelming users with mostly extraneous alternatives. Finally, given the node layout we can color, highlight, or hide links and nodes according to, for example, the number of packets that were sent between two hardware nodes, MPI rank (unique identifiers given to label each communicating node), or other recorded performance measurements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Visual Navigation</head><p>For each of the three projected views that we display to the user, we provide a minimap on the top left corner of the window in which each bundle of links is replaced by a single edge that represents the mean behavior of the bundle (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>). The user can interactively switch between these views to explore the different layouts. Additionally, we provide a set of axes on the lower left corner that indicate which direction of links in the projections are currently displayed with respect to the network topology. The user can select and deselect axes to show and hide the corresponding links as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5(a)</ref>. If both horizontal and vertical links are shown, we use the concentric ring layout to show half of each set. Instead, if only one direction is selected, all of the corresponding links will be shown.</p><p>Finally, we provide an interactive legend to interact with the se- lected color space for showing the communication data, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5(b)</ref>. We explored different metaphors, such as thickness for communication, but found color to be the most intuitive for users. The user can drag and slide both the minimum and maximum values along the color bar, and we adjust the range of colors accordingly. Links below the minimum are not drawn (following a visual metaphor of them being insignificant amounts of communication), while links above the maximum are drawn with the same color as the maximum (indicating they are utilized at or above the maximum amount). When the legend is updated, we update all three minimaps as well as the full scale projected view. This feature synchronizes the two views without causing discrepancies. Following this rule becomes particularly important when multiple datasets are loaded simultaneously. In this case, interaction with the slider can update all views to provide an equal context for comparing performance of different runs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Linking the Projection with a 3D View</head><p>While somewhat unintuitive for the uninitiated, we have found that most application developers are well accustomed to think in terms of the torus structure of the physical network topology. In response, we have included a 3D view representing the torus as a regular grid of nodes with a set of "open" links at the torus boundaries. As expected, the resulting view can suffer from occlusion and visual clutter which can make it difficult to comprehend. However, integrating the two views into a linked view system has proven remarkably effective. The 2D projection provides an intuitive way to study all communication data at a glance and, more importantly, to select interesting (sets of) nodes. The selection is then highlighted in the 3D environment deemphasizing all unrelated nodes and links (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>) This tool provides developers with the desired context of the true network topology in which, for example, it is easy to judge distances and reason about potential hardware effects. Simultaneously, it largely solves the occlusion problem by concentrating on a small subset of nodes and links. The user can rotate, pan and zoom to find the most salient view of the data. Additionally, as discussed in more detail in Section 5, the 3D view has proven useful to understand the effects of different mappings of processes to nodes. By selecting and highlighting nodes and/or processes within MPI communicators, their physical location on the hardware can provide important insights. Our system enables cross-linked selection of (groups of) nodes either by selecting nodes one by one, through selection boxes, or according to predefined groups such as MPI communicators. <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> highlights some of the typical use cases for selected between the two windows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Implementation</head><p>Given the large variety of different platforms and environments our users operate on portability and robustness are major concerns. Additionally, performance analysis is notorious for requiring some amount of customization to adjust tools to the immense variety of specific tasks. Therefore, we have chosen to implement our system with Python <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> to ensure maximal portability and flexibility. The interactive rendering uses a OpenGL design written using PyOpenGL wrappers. While this sacrifices some amount of rendering performance, a Python based rendering better integrates with the other components and data structures. The data format is based on YAML <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> which provides an easy to use cross-platform and cross-programming language data serialization that has been simple to integrate into the existing data collection framework. Finally, the internal data representation and querying uses NumPy <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> arrays of records as data tables; however our intention is to build upon a more sophisticated data store as the complexity and size of data grows. While the current implementation is a prototype, the system is scheduled to be released under an open source licence as part of ongoing tool deployments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CASE STUDY</head><p>Our team consists of a mix of experts in visualization, performance analysis, and computational science all of which contributed to the design of the tool. We are actively using the tool to study the performance of several massively parallel simulation codes and here we report results for pF3D running on a BG/P. We repeatedly ran the simulation using three different node configurations containing 512 nodes (2,048 cores arranged on an 8 × 8 × 8 torus), 1,024 nodes (4,096 cores, 8 × 8 × 16) and 16,384 nodes (65,536 cores, 16 × 16 × 32).</p><p>The tool helped both the application developers and scientists on our team to investigate the scaling behavior of pF3D as well as the performance experts to explore idiosyncrasies in network behavior given different node mappings. Due to the structured 3D nature of pF3D, a fundamental problem for developers is managing how best to map the individual 2D slabs of this problem to the 3D torus network of BG/P, while also taking into account the cross slab communication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Understanding the Default Behavior of pF3D</head><p>There exist a large number of different ways to map the xy-slabs used by pF3D onto the hardware domain. Therefore, one of the primary challenges for scientists and developers is to identify "good" mappings that translate into high performance. Also, scalability as we run on greater number of nodes is important and in particular scalability that is well understood and predictable. This explains why pF3D by default uses the trivial "row-major" mapping usually called TXYZ as MPI ranks are assigned in order to: first the cores on a node (T); then, the nodes along the x-axis of the torus (X) within an xy plane, then along the y-axis in the same plane (Y) and finally other xy planes perpendicular to the z-direction (Z). <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. Visualizations of the aggregate communication for the x-and y-phases of pF3D using the default layout. Highlighting xy-slabs of 32 nodes in both the 2D and 3D view clearly indicates that all communication (in these phases) is confined to the individual slabs. The minimaps confirm this conclusion by indicating that many links are entirely unused. <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> shows this default mapping with xy-slabs highlighted for a 1,024 node (8 × 8 × 16) run of pF3D. In this case the application domain is decomposed into 32 xy-slabs each containing an array of 16×8 patches. Each xy-slab uses 128 cores on 32 nodes and thus in the TXYZ mapping two pF3D xy-slabs make up one plane of the hardware torus. The 2D view clearly displays the xy-slabs. Colors are used to distinguish slabs. Nodes lying in the same xy-slab are given the same color. Two selected xy-slabs of pF3D are then shown in the 3D view to provide a context of the virtual application topology familiar to the scientists. In this case, the 32 slabs of pF3D clearly dominate the network traffic as communication is confined within each plane.</p><p>Given the visualization shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>, it is immediately apparent that a large number of available hardware links are not utilized which suggests there may be room for improvement. Nevertheless, this mapping is fully symmetric and given the uniform nodes of a BG/P system ultimately scalable to the largest available partitions. At the largest configurations the scaling of a code will dominate all other effects, and experimenting with potentially sub-optimal mappings can be expensive with respect to both time and resources. This explains the predilection for the default mapping whose behavior, while potentially not optimal, is well understood and exhibits little variation at different scales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Comparing Node Mappings</head><p>As discussed above, the behavior of the default mapping is fairly predictable and our tool was mainly used to validate prior expectations. However, when experimenting with different mappings the network traffic becomes far less predictable. Through extensive experiments in which the aggregated bandwidth was recorded for different mappings (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>) the performance experts knew a priori that certain mappings can achieve significantly better performance than the default. However, the causes of these differences were unclear. In particular, these may have been effects particular to a specific number of nodes or configuration which would raise doubts about the scalability of the mappings. Furthermore, understanding the difference in network traffic between various mappings in detail can provide insights into the design of even better mappings. We experiment with five different mapping types each with different characteristics. In addition to the default mapping we use an XYZT mapping, a tiled layout, and two different tilted layouts, one tilted just along the z-axis and one tilted along both z and y. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 7</ref> shows the node mappings using the 3D view for an 8 × 8 × 8 hardware torus using 16 slabs of 16 × 8 patches. The XYZT layout spreads out the x-communicators by distributing them on individual nodes rather than four to a node as the default. As a result a single slab is spread between two planes of the torus rather than the half plane of the default. The tile mapping is similar to the XYZT mapping, but changes the orientation of the layout by mapping slabs into tiles perpendicular to slabs in the default mapping. The tiltZ mapping starts from the tiled layout but then "tilts" each yz-plane of the torus in the z direction. This drastically increases the size of their bounding box. TiltZY further modifies tiltZ by introducing a second tilt in the y direction. This increases the bounding box of the nodes even further.</p><p>Given this context, we compare network traffic for the five different node mappings at different scales. These are concisely described by the minimaps of the 2D projection, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figs. 8(a)</ref>   and 8(b) (1,024 nodes). By using an interactive slider that controls all five views simultaneously we can provide potential explanations for the performance measurements in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. In particular, the TXYZ mapping entirely excludes communication in the z-direction, strongly clustering communication in the other two as only half planes communicate. Instead, the XYZT mapping spreads out the nodes more and utilizes some z-links within a slab. The minimaps clearly show a more even distribution of communication load even though the same patterns as the TXYZ mappings are apparent. This provides a significant boost in performance by more than doubling the total bandwidth. The tile mapping acts roughly like a rotated XYZT mapping and shows very similar behavior and performance. The TiltZ mapping however further balances the communication. In particular, note how both the top and bottom minimap indicate (relative) increases in x communication. Since the total amount of communication is independent of the mapping, this increase actually indicates a further balancing of the communication. The better distribution of traffic is correlated with higher performance. Finally, the TiltZY follows the same trend: The minimaps, especially the topmost, indicate much more evenly distributed network traffic and the bandwidth indicates better performance.</p><p>These experiments strongly suggest that evenly distributing the traffic leads to better bandwidth usage. Part of the current hypothesis is that increasing the effective bounding box sizes of the slabs and evening out their aspect ratios drastically increases the number of potential routes a packet can choose. Coupled with the dynamic routing of the BG/P system, this may be the cause for the increase in aggregate bandwidth. Note that the fact that providing more routes increases the potential bandwidth is expected. However, under the current thinking pF3D is not bandwidth limited thus the fact that increasing the available bandwidth caused increased traffic rates was a novel finding. Additionally, the best mappings clearly increase the distance packets must travel which, however, does not seem to have a negative effect. This is especially surprising for the default mapping as much of its x communication is restricted to intra-node communication which is expected to be significantly faster than any inter-node messaging. By providing an intuitive way to explore and illustrate the network traffic our tool has been instrumental in better understanding this unexpected network behavior, overturning assumptions, and forming new hypotheses.   In the 3D view, nodes lying in the same y communicator are given the same color. We can see that there is no communication in the z direction (in the middle and bottom minimap and 3D view) as communication does not take place across communicators.We observe similar patterns at all scales of pF3D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Visualizing the Behavior of pF3D at Scale</head><p>Our final experiment in the case study is to observe the communication behavior of pF3D as the size of the problem scaled to larger runs on BG/P. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 9</ref> shows a summary of the different aspects of this visualization. By loading each run simultaneously, we were again able to visualize the data from each run using a shared color scale. One observation we can draw from the combined minimap views in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b) is that, despite the problem size, the amount of communication that happens on each link stays roughly the same across scales.</p><p>Moreover, even when the network topology changes from a cube to a rectangular-prism, generic communication trends in each direction stay relatively fixed. These two observations help explain why pF3D scales well to larger sizes and corroborate well with the scientists' experiences running pF3D on larger scales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Exploring Fine-Grained Network Behavior</head><p>For one of our simulation runs (1,024 nodes, using an XYZT node mapping described in Section 5.2) the tool immediately highlighted one particular hot edge. On closer investigation we found that the maximum number of packets sent over this link was 271 million, a number far outside the expected range (and in fact outside the physically feasible range). During discussion with the performance experts, it was determined that this anomaly was the result of a data collection error. Our tool helped to easily identify correctness problem in the measurement environment indicated through the abnormal link. The link was discovered by simply restricting the color map to show only links above the expect values. Zooming into the neighborhood as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 10</ref>, and highlighting the respective planes of node, provides the necessary context to locate and diagnose the problem. Even though a simple scan through the data could have revealed the same information, our tool eliminated the needs for special tests, exposed this unexpected and otherwise probably overlooked issue, and provided a quick and intuitive means to understand and ultimately address the problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DISCUSSION</head><p>While the performance of single CPU applications is typically well summarized by simple profiles, understanding the behavior of massively parallel systems is a challenging and largely unsolved problem. Here we have demonstrated a new tool to provide an intuitive visualization of one of the most crucial aspects of performance: network utilization. Our system enables the rapid visual analysis of otherwise abstract data and has been crucial in providing new insights to both application developers and performance analysis experts. Nevertheless, this is only a first step in applying advanced information visualization approaches to this type of performance analysis.</p><p>Two major design choices require further discussion. First, in this work we link together a 2D projected view of the network with a 3D view of the BG/P hardware torus. The 3D view, while familiar to application developers, has a number of obvious deficiencies with regards to occlusion and interaction. We chose to keep both views instead of using only a 2D view, as a direct response to feedback from the performance analysts working on our team. This domain is "natural" for application developers because both the network as well as the simulation domain are three dimensional, so often correlations can be drawn between the two spaces. While there are a variety of different networks used in HPC systems, many of the simulations of interest will remain in 3D for the foreseeable future.</p><p>A second important design choice was to use static views which summarize a single phase of computation. These provide a compromise from the point of view of data collection: instead of looking at the fine-grained data for each individual communication or the sum of all communication, we take coarse steps. Our tool allows for loading up an entire simulation run, but then displays only a selected phase. What is missing in our tool is the notion of a timeline, where an analyst can play back individual runs and see how the communication changed throughout. This would surely be useful, as understanding the communication during the progression of phases has proven informative in past work <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. However, we remark that often, and especially for pF3D, only a few phases of the computation have significant communication and viewing them individual has significant utility for optimization.</p><p>Many other avenues of future work remain. Our tool produces a large number of different projections, some of which may be more helpful than others. However, currently it is unclear how to make this large number of choices available without overwhelming users. Furthermore, the system is reaching its limit with current supercomputers in terms of the number of nodes that are practical to display. For future HPC machines one will likely need additional levels of resolution to provide an adequate context. This will have to lead to new ways to aggregate and summarize data, which is non-trivial in this abstract, non-spatial space. Furthermore, there exist other interesting classes of scientific applications, such as particle-based codes or simulations using adaptively refined grids. While many of our concepts will carry over, analyzing such applications will require new types of illustrations to highlight the dynamic changes as the simulation progresses. Finally, the next generation of HPC machines that are currently being deployed, rely on even higher dimensional networks, e.g., in the case of BG/Q a 5D torus. These machines will require more aggressive projections showing fewer links simultaneously, creating more challenging problems to solve. For non-torus network topologies, we are also considering various projections which might work along either application space dimensions or other, user-defined, dimensions in the network space. Our goal is to extend the same level of interactivity and intuition to developers of future parallel applications, as we expect many of the most interesting scientific applications will ultimately use HPC resources.</p><p>Finally, we remark that both scientists and performance analysts have given us positive feedback regarding the use of this tool. This tool specifically made it easier for application developers to see the effects that different node mappings have on network traffic. In particular, the results of Section 5 have lead to the scientists using the tilt mappings for their current runs of pF3D, and the performance analysts better understanding why such mappings work well. Our next steps are to extend these visualizations for discovering new mappings and exploring which are most optimal. This work represents a first step towards understanding network behavior and identifying contention. We plan to next consider how best to use this tool to build models which can predict network behavior, and potentially use (semi-)automatic techniques to find optimal node mappings for large scale simulations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>•</head><label></label><figDesc>A.
