				<p>We propose a method to highlight query hits in hierarchically clustered collections of interrelated items such as digital libraries or knowledge bases. The method is based on the idea that organizing search results similarly to their arrangement on a fixed reference map facilitates orientation and assessment by preserving a user&apos;s mental map. Here, the reference map is built from an MDS layout of the items in a Voronoi treemap representing their hierarchical clustering, and we use techniques from dynamic graph layout to align query results with the map. The approach is illustrated on an archive of newspaper articles.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>We consider the visual representation of search results in hierarchically structured information spaces containing interrelated units. The application inspiring this work is an organizational knowledge base consisting of documents and a similarity relation, but digital libraries, data warehouses, inventories, intranets, and wikis are but a few examples of applications posing similar problems.</p><p>Search results are predominantly represented as relevance-ordered lists. While these have proven very efficient for the identification of the most relevant hits, they do not lend themselves to conveying a sense of "location" in the information space, or relations among the hits. These aspects may be important, however, if the primary purpose of the query is not to find the most relevant items (relative to the query) but to assess properties of the entire set of search results.</p><p>Alternative graphical representations have been proposed that show hits in their context, the distribution of hits, or relations among hits. We combine some core elements of such approaches with more elaborate layout algorithms and introduce the concept of a reference map to help users build a mental map of the information space. Concretely, a reference map is a graphical representation of all elements in the database respecting their organization. The visualization of a query result is organized in the same way but adapted to the subset of data units matching the query. Using techniques from dynamic graph layout, we make sure that the spatial organization of adapted maps resembles that of the reference map without showing irrelevant information.</p><p>• Both authors are with the Dept. Computer &amp; Information Science, University of Konstanz. e-mail: {arlind.nocaj, ulrik.brandes}@uni-konstanz.de.</p><p>Manuscript received 31 March 2012; accepted 1 August 2012; posted online 14 October 2012; mailed on 5 October 2012. For information on obtaining reprints of this article, please send e-mail to: tvcg@computer.org.</p><p>In the extreme case of a universal query, the result map is supposed to be identical to the reference map. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 1(a)</ref> shows a reference map, which is computed in advance and considers the similarities of the textual hierarchy items. After entering a query, irrelevant subhierarchies are filtered and areas of remaining hierarchy elements are adjusted according to relevancy with respect to the query ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 1(b)</ref>). Search hits are represented as nodes with additional links representing an apparent degree of similarity. The entire work flow of our approach is summarized in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. For contextualization, however, we first review related work in Section 2 and formalize the setting in Section 3, together with a brief review of the basic building blocks employed in our approach. The approach itself is outlined in Section 4 and quantitatively evaluated in Section 5. We conclude with a brief discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Two complementary notions of information context support the positioning of informational units in an information space: hierarchical organization and horizontal relationships. For hierarchical structure in particular, a study of educational digital libraries found great potential for its use also in the organization of search results <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. We next review previous approaches that make use of at least one of the above types of information context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Placement by similarity</head><p>The idea of a global map, in which units are organized by similarity, is the basis of WebSOM <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, a system for querying document collections. Based on feature vectors describing the documents, a selforganizing map <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> is used to create the thematic map, consisting of document locations and automatically extracted labels. The feature vector of a query document can then be located on the map, and similar documents are found in its vicinity. SPIRE <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> is similar to WebSOM: It represents documents as stars in a galaxy. Peaks in a region describe high concentration of similar documents. It furthermore offers more possibilities for mapping meta data to the visualization.</p><p>Galaxy of News <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> also constructs relations between related news articles, but allows exploration of the data through navigation and visualization of categorical keywords. Selecting a keyword changes the view and puts the corresponding part of the information space into focus. We extend this idea in order to allow focusing on several parts of the information space by providing more visible area for their visualization. The idea of focusing on certain parts of information space is incorporated in our approach by using more visible area for these parts.</p><p>Another interesting method is TopicNets <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, where documents, topics, and other semantic units from text corpora are represented as a node-link diagram (graph), in which the layout is iteratively refined after filtering is applied on the graph. Although we do not use topics, we also refine the layout after filtering the search space according to a given query and its results, but in addition to this we also preserve a given hierarchy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Placement by hierarchical structure</head><p>The idea of Cat-A-Cone is to provide a navigation interface for a hierarchy by using cone trees in a three dimensional view. This supports the localization of leaf items since they are placed in the context of a hierarchy. Instead of using a three dimensional view, we will use a space filling visualization to show the hierarchy and relate the items to it.</p><p>While the Hyperbolic Browser <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> represents a tree or a hierarchy in two dimensions by using hyperbolic arcs in 2D, the H3 Browser <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> uses a 3D sphere for the same visualization. Important elements can be put on focus by reorganizing the tree such that the desired elements are located in the center. Instead of putting the important parts of the hierarchy into the center, we use the size to increase visibility. This allows several different hierarchy parts to come to the fore.</p><p>ResultMaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> is a treemap based visualization which is used in addition to the normal ranking based list representation. By using Squarified treemaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, a good aspect ratio is achieved, which simplifies the perception of the visible objects. Unit items resulting from a search query are contextualized by highlighting the corresponding rectangles with a categorical color. We also use a space-filling approach to visualize the hierarchy, but adapt the space-filling technique to use the available area for the important parts of the hierarchy, e.g., according to the score of the search results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Placement by similarity and hierarchical structure</head><p>InfoSky <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> uses Voronoi diagrams to partition the space into galaxies according to categories. The search results of a query are placed as small stars, according to their similarity into these static galaxies. Search results are highlighted in these galaxies and further interactive exploration is possible. As a commercial attempt, WebMaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> is very similar to InfoSky, but partitions the space in a different way for a set of categories by using a grid. In comparison to this, our result visualization is not static, but is modified dynamically according to the query hits.</p><p>Another space-filling approach is Information Pyramids <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, which concentrates on a 3D treemap view to represent the hierarchy and the corresponding items.</p><p>In contrast to the previous approaches, FacetAtlas <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> constructs the hierarchy by a kernel density based clustering after the search results are given. The resulting visualization is similar to a heat map showing the distribution of the search results. Different node and edge colors are used for semantically different types of relations. Further hierarchical edge bundling is applied to reduce clutter. Our method differs in two points from FacetAtlas. The hierarchy is given in the preprocessing step and maintained over all queries, while FacetAtlas generates the hierarchy on the fly after the search results are given.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PRELIMINARIES</head><p>In the following, we will describe the framework requirements for our search result visualization. In the remainder of this section, we further define the data bases and shortly introduce the used techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The Scenario</head><p>We are given a graph G = (V, E) where the nodes V represent the unit items. For concreteness we will use documents instead of unit items, although our approach is not limited to documents. Furthermore, E expresses the relations, e.g., similarity between documents.</p><p>A search query is a sequence of words or characters. The duration between entering two characters could also be seen as part of the search query formulation.</p><p>The result of a static search query is a set of documents</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D = {d 1 , . . . , d k } ⊂ V with positive real weights w i = w(d i ) ∈ R &gt;0</formula><p>corresponding to the score.</p><p>A further extension of this search query model could be dynamic search queries, for which at each character input a refinement is done for the result set. In this case the duration between the character submissions gives further hints with which certainty the characters are entered. Although dynamic queries could be integrated into our visualization, we concentrate on static queries in the remainder.</p><p>The idea is to visualize the search results, together with the corresponding hierarchy, in such a way that important parts of the hierarchy are emphasized and the user's mental map is supported due to the similar search result organization for each search query.</p><p>We further want the size of the visual objects to reflect the number or the score of the search hits. If a hierarchy part contains more or better search hits, it should be visually represented with more area.</p><p>This method is suitable for search systems which are used over and over again and where the underlying hierarchical structure does not change too much in general, e.g., libraries or knowledge bases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Hierarchical Document Collections</head><p>From our point of view, the search space is a set of documents with a given hierarchy. In addition, there are relations between documents, e.g., denoting similarity. We model this as a hierarchically clustered graph. Let G = (V, E) be a Graph with V the set of nodes and E ⊆ V × V the set of edges. V represents the set of documents and E denotes relations between two documents. The hierarchical clustering is defined by using another set C of nodes and another set H of edges between nodes n 1 , n 2 ∈ (C ∪ V ). C represents the clusters and H ⊆ (V ×V ) ∪ (C ×C) represents the hierarchy. An edge between two clusters denotes the inclusion of one cluster another. An edge between two nodes v ∈ V and c ∈ C denotes that v is contained in cluster c. Since it is a hierarchy it must have a unique root r ∈ C. A hierarchically clustered graph G H is thus given by G H = (V ∪ C, E ∪ H, r), where the subgraph T = (C ∪V, H) is a rooted tree with root r ∈ C, see  A path from u to v in a hierarchically clustered graph</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">G H = (V ∪ C, E ∪ H, r), where u, v ∈ (V ∪ C)</formula><p>, is an ordered sequence of nodes which describes the path on the hierarchy of G H .</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">path(u, v) = (n 1 , n 2 , . . . , n k ) : [n i ∈ (V ∪C), i = 1, . . . , k] ∧ (n 1 = u) ∧ (n k = v) ∧ (n j , n j + 1) ∈ H, j = 1, . . . , k − 1</formula><p>Note that due to the hierarchy for every edge (v, w) ∈ H, it holds that the length of path(r, v) is exactly by one shorter than path(r, w). We further define the children of a node n ∈ (V ∪C) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">children(n) = x ∈ (V ∪C) (n, x) ∈ H ,</formula><p>and for two different nodes v, w ∈ V ∪ C, the least common ancestor (LCA) as the first node x ∈ C which v and w have in common when walking towards the root in the hierarchy:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">LCA(v, w) = {x ∈ C : path(x, v) = (x, n 1 , . . . , n k , v) ∧ path(x, w) = (x, n * 1 , . . . , n * l , w) ∧ [n i = n * i , i = 1, . . . , min(k, l)] }</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Voronoi Treemap</head><p>In order to put the search results in the hierarchical context, we need to visualize the hierarchy. But doing this, e.g., by drawing the hierarchy as a tree, wastes a lot of space. Space-filling techniques, in contrast, allow for efficient space usage. Treemaps have been proposed as a space-filling representation of inclusion hierarchies <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Each node of the hierarchy tree is depicted by a rectangle, and rectangles are subdivided recursively into smaller rectangles depicting the children of the corresponding tree node. In most applications, base elements have associated weights, and the area of a rectangle is required to be proportional to the total weight of the corresponding subset. There are several other degrees of freedom in this representation, in particular with respect to layout and rendering, and many of them have been utilized in various applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. But all rectangular treemap approaches have one major disadvantage. In general it is not possible to keep a given ordering and have good aspect ratio at the same time.</p><p>A special variant are Voronoi treemaps, in which more general polygons are used instead of rectangles. To the best of our knowledge, Andrews et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> were the first to suggest the nesting of Voronoi diagrams to represent a hierarchy. But their suggested heuristic was not picked up due to the lack of good aspect ratio. Only after Balzer and Deussen <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> defined the polygons as the regions of centroidal Voronoi diagrams (CVD) and named it Voronoi treemap, it was made use of. Using CVDs results in a visualization which has good aspect ratio and an appealing, organic look to it. Moreover, Voronoi treemaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> are more robust with regard to changes in time-varying hierarchical data and tend to provide distinguishable and memorable polygon shapes, which makes it easier for users to exploit spatial memory. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref> shows an example of a Voronoi treemap.</p><p>We adapt the approach from Nocaj and Brandes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> by using Fortune's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> for weighted Voronoi diagrams.</p><p>The Voronoi treemap algorithm consists of two parts. The first part is the computation of a single layer treemap for a set of Sites S = {s 1 , . . . , s n } and the corresponding target areas</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">g i = g(s i ) ∈ (0, 1), i = 1, . . . , n in a region R, where ∑ i∈{1,...,n} g i = 1.</formula><p>Here the result is a weighted Voronoi diagram V {S} = {R 1 , . . . , R n } with n regions. The second part consists of the recursive usage of the resulting regions as input for the next levels with the same procedure.</p><p>Since no algorithm is known for directly determining site positions and weights of a weighted Voronoi diagram, so that the area of each resulting region R i , i = 1, . . . , n is proportional to the target area g i and the site positions are coincident with the centroids of the respective regions, an iterative approximation procedure is used.</p><p>The single layer Voronoi treemap algorithm is an extension of Lloyd's method <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and works as follows:</p><p>• Initialize sites with random positions and zero weights.</p><p>• Iterate until result is satisfying -Compute weighted Voronoi diagram V (S).</p><p>-Move sites to the center of the respective region (Lloyd's method) to improve the aspect ratio. -Adapt the weights to reduce the area misrepresentation.</p><p>Due to this iterative procedure, the final site positions normally differ from the initial site positions. Since we are interested in keeping the overall structure, we will use the reference map to initialize the single layer treemap algorithm. Note that later Lloyd's method was also used by Lyons <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref> to distribute the nodes more equally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)</head><p>Organizing similar documents and similar hierarchy parts close together facilitates the orientation and assessment. To achieve this goal we use multidimensional scaling (MDS). This technique is used several times in our visualization. In a preprocessing step, it is used to compute the reference map in which similar objects have similar positions, and in a postprocessing step, it is used to influence the layout according to the results of the search query. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref> one can see that MDS brings the two similar cells closer together. MDS is con- cerned with geometrical positioning of objects whose pairwise similarities (dissimilarities) are given. The positioning should be in such a way that the Euclidean distance between two objects represents their similarity (dissimilarity). The commonly used techniques are classical scaling and distance scaling. Classical scaling is based on spectral decomposition and yields an essentially unique solution (coordinates), while distance scaling iteratively improves the layout, given initial positions, by adapting the coordinates to fit given distances. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> for an introduction.</p><p>Let V = {1, . . . , n} be a set of n objects and let D ∈ R n×n be a square matrix of dissimilarities for each pair of objects i, j ∈ V . The goal of MDS is to find a matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">X = [x 1 , . . . , x n ] T ∈ R n×d of d-dimensional positions x 1 , . . . , x n ∈ R d such that x i − x j ≈ d i j<label>(1)</label></formula><p>for all i, j ∈ V , is met as closely as possible. Note that since we want a two-dimensional layout, d = 2. In the case of graph drawing the distances d i j reflect the graph-theoretic distance of two nodes i and j.</p><p>The experimental study of Brandes and Pich <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> showed that using classical scaling as initialization for the graph layout and then improving the layout by minimizing the stress with Stress Majorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> yields the best results in general. While the classical scaling of the first step creates layouts with good representations of large distances, the second step improves local details of the layout. For the first step, the study suggests the use of PivotMDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, an approximation of the classical scaling, which scales very well to large graphs since it needs only linear time. The study suggests in particular that this technique is superior to the often used force-directed methods, since it is faster and yields better results with similar implementation effort.</p><p>As in the general MDS for each pair of nodes i, j ∈ V there is an ideal distance d i j ∈ R + . A d-dimensional layout is given by an n × d matrix X. A node i has the position X i ∈ R d . The axes of the layout are defined by X <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> , . . . , X (d) ∈ R n . The deviation of the ideal distances of the nodes causes the so-called stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">stress(X) = ∑ i&lt; j w i j ||X i − X j || − d i j 2 .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The stress is reduced in each iteration, up to convergence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1">Stress Majorization with Anchoring</head><p>We now explain the technique which is used in a post-processing step in which the search hits of a query are already given. The idea is to position the hits as nodes in a way that preserves the reference map as much as possible but refines the positions according to the search hits. One way of doing this is dynamic graph drawing. The general goal of dynamic graph drawing is that two consecutive layouts, e.g., of the same graph, should not differ too much. For this purpose anchoring can be used to stabilize the iteratively improving layout by inserting dummy nodes and linking them to existing nodes in the graph. The dummy nodes correspond to the positions derived from the reference map for the search hits and are only used to stabilize the layout, they are not shown in the final visualization. By fixing the dummy nodes on their positions, the resulting document graph of a query is anchored on these points. Depending on the given weights of the anchoring edges, it is possible to control how much the positions of the linked nodes, and thus also the other connected parts of the graph, are allowed to change, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> for further details.</p><p>When minimizing the stress, it is important to fix the dummy nodes, otherwise a structural change would be introduced and the layout would not be stabilized. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5(a)</ref> shows an effect which the anchoring can have. Search hits, which are strongly connected with each other in the document graph can move closer together, but still maintain the reference map due to the anchoring. The resulting layout is a combination of the reference map and influence by the query results. It can be understood as a combination of the search space with the query space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2">Constrained Stress Majorization</head><p>As we want to maintain the hierarchical structure, it is also important to constrain the Stress Majorization to certain regions. Each node is only allowed to be positioned in its respective Voronoi region. This is done by extending the iterative Stress Majorization with a step which projects the layout back to a valid state, as Dwyer and Mariott <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> propose. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5</ref>(b) illustrates this technique, which is also called scaled gradient projection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Hierarchical Edge Bundling</head><p>Although we consider similarity for document placements, it could be the case that two similar documents are far apart. It is thus important to visualize the relationship between two similar documents. But visualizing the relations (edges) by straight lines results in a clutter, even for few edges. By bundling edges which have something in common, one can get reduce clutter and thus achieve more readability in a visualization. In case of a hierarchical structure of linked nodes, Holten <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> suggests to use the underlying hierarchical structure to bundle the edges.</p><p>Given a hierarchically clustered graph G H = (V ∪ C, E ∪ H, r) Holten's edge routing for an edge e = (v 1 , v 2 ) ∈ E describes the shortest path of v 1 and v 2 in the subgraph T = (V ∪ C, H). If two shortest paths partly share a path on the hierarchy, their routing is influenced by the same control points.</p><p>The control polygon is created by using the centroid positions of the nodes on the path from the start node to the end node. The control point polygon of two nodes P start and P end is thus defined as CP(P start , P end ) =path(P start , P end ) =path(P start , LCA(P start , P end )) ∪ path(LCA(P start , P end ), P end ).</p><p>For routing the edges smoothly one can use different curves. After testing different curves we decided to take cubic Bézier curves since they created smooth curves and do not have a high computational complexity. A cubic Bézier curve can be described with the following function <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">BC(t) = (1 − t) 3 P 0 + 3t(1 − t) 2 P 1 + 3t 2 (1 − t) * P 2 + t 3 P 3 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where t ∈ [0, 1] describes the position on the curve. As Holten <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> describes, one can control the bundling strength by straightening the control polygon with a parameter β ∈ [0, 1] in the direction of the segment between the first and last control point. The straightened control polygon is then given by the following points:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">P i = β • P i + 1 − β P 0 + i k − 1 (P k−1 − P 0 ) ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where k is the number of control points, P i the control point with index i ∈ {2, . . . , k − 1} and β ∈ [0, 1] the bundling strength. We further removed the LCA from the control polygon in order to smooth the curves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">THE APPROACH</head><p>In this section, we introduce our search result visualization. First, in a preprocessing step, we create a static reference map of the document hierarchy according to document similarities. By using multidimensional scaling in this step we ensure that similar documents, or similar hierarchy parts are close together in the map. The reference map is basically a Voronoi treemap combined with an offset for each hierarchy and document node relative to their parent node in the hierarchy.</p><p>After entering a search query, the reduced document collection is laid out according to the reference map. Hierarchy parts (cells) without hits are filtered and the cell areas for the remaining parts are adjusted to represent the distribution of hits or another scoring weight of the query. By using the reference map as initial layout, the overall structure is mostly maintained, as measurements show. The final Voronoi treemap thus represents a subhierarchy of a hierarchically clustered document collection. The available space is used efficiently, and the context of the result documents is shown by drawing them as nodes and their dependencies as hierarchically bundled edges. The final position of a  <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. Representation of the layout steps. The search query yields search results that are organized with a reference map and refined according to the result dependencies to build a search result visualization.</p><p>search hit is based on the reference map (all documents), but further refined according to other similar hits in the document graph. <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> illustrated the main ideas of our approach. Like Clarkson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, we use a treemap to represent the hierarchy, but our approach differs in the following points:</p><p>• Reference map to preserve mental map and put similar documents close together • Dynamic adjustment of the hierarchy visualization to emphasize important parts of the hierarchy • Flexible Voronoi treemap instead of rectangular treemap</p><p>• Document position refinement step, according to the search results • Dependency Visualization (Hierarchical Edge Bundling)</p><p>As a byproduct of the Voronoi treemap we gain good aspect ratios of the objects in the visualization.</p><p>Mental map formation is supported by maintaining certain properties of a layout. Bridgeman and Tamassia <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> formally defined those factors in terms of graph drawing and evaluated them in a user study. They suggest that ranking and nearest neighbor are among the best factors to measure the mental map. Although results of user studies on the effect of mental map preservation in dynamic graphs exist, e.g., Archambault et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, it is not clear how these can be interpreted in the context of Voronoi treemaps. Further studies with modified tasks would be necessary for doing this.</p><p>We support mental map preservation by means of a reference map in our layout and measure the quality according to ranking and nearest neighbor.</p></div>

If two documents are similar enough we create an edge between the corresponding nodes in the document graph.</p><p>There are different approaches that model document similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. As an example, we decided to use the simple word based Vector Space Model. Other approaches such as Latent Semantic Analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> could be used as well and might possibly yield better results in terms of human similarity measure; they could easily be integrated.</p><p>In our case, documents consist of a sequence of words.</p><p>Vector Space Model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">A document d j ∈ D is represented as a vector d j = (w 1 j , w 2 j , . . . , w m j ),</formula><p>where w i ∈ R + , i ∈ {1, . . . , n} is a weight for a word (also called term) t i ∈ T and m = |T | is the size of the vocabulary, which is the number of different words over all documents. Each term is represented by one dimension.</p><p>The weight describes the importance of a term in the document. One could use, e.g., zero for the weight if the term is not contained in the document and one if it is contained. A better method for the weighting is the tf-idf method <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, which makes use of the observation that words which are contained in every document do not contribute in getting different similarities. Rare terms may be more informative than frequent terms. The weights are thus defined as the product of the term frequency tf and the inverted document frequency idf:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">w i j = log 1 + tf i j × log |D| df i ,</formula><p>where tf i j describes the frequency of a term t i in the document d j and df i the number of documents in which term t i is contained. The logarithm is used such that extremely frequent terms do not influence the similarity measure too much. The weights define the |T | × |D| term-document matrix. Although the Euclidean distance could be used to define a similarity for two document vectors, it is not done because the Euclidean distance may be large, although the term distribution of the documents is nearly the same. Thus the angle between two document vectors is used to describe the similarity. Since the cosine monotonically decreases from 0 to π, we use for two document vectors d, e ∈ D:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">cos d, e = d • e | d|| e| = ∑ |T | i=1 d i e i ∑ |T | i=1 d 2 i ∑ |T | i=1 e 2 i .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>To improve the quality of the similarity function, noise is removed by applying the following filtering steps:</p><p>• Transformation of upper case to lower case • Remove punctuation marks • Remove stopwords • Identify and merge different word forms by using Stemming <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> • Remove terms that occur only in one document Finally, we define the edges of the document graph. Since we want to put similar documents close together, we need to create edges between documents if they are similar enough and thus the cosine similarity is below a data dependent threshold.</p><p>Note that the term-document matrix is very sparse, which means that most entries are zero. Furthermore, the numbers of different terms and thus the dimensionality of the vector space is very high. This tends to produce low variance in the similarity measure, which makes the identification of the correct threshold even for a single data set very hard.</p><p>Runtime Analysis: First, the tf-idf matrix has to be created and then the pairwise document distances have to be computed. The creation of the matrix clearly needs O (|D| • |T |) time and space. In our case, we assume that the vocabulary size is bounded by a large constant, which implies that the computation of the pairwise distances needs O |D| 2 time and space. Note that in the general case, Heaps' law <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> suggests that the vocabulary size is a function of the document collection size. If the vocabulary size is linear in the number of documents, the runtime would be O |D| 3 , see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> for more details on index construction.</p></div>

Derive the reference map from the layout. <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>. Reference map computation: First, the document graph is determined by using the cosine similarity of the tf-idf vectors and a given threshold. Then the layout of the document graph is computed with MDS. For each node, the vector, relative to the centroid of its parent in the hierarchy, is used as Reference Map vector.</p><p>Let G H = (V ∪C, E ∪ H, r) be a hierarchically clustered graph.

First, the distance between two children v * , w * of a node c ∈ C has to be determined by counting the number of edges e ∈ E between nodes in the corresponding subtree (Line 4). The pairwise distances between the nodes are then used for the MDS layout, which places nodes, whose subtrees have a high number of edges among each other, close together (Line 7). The resulting node positions are averaged to determine the centroid and the reference map vectors r x relatively to the centroid for each node x ∈ V ∪C. <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref> illustrates this process. </p><formula xml:id="formula_14">{r x ∈ R 2 | x ∈ V ∪C \ {r}} 1 foreach c ∈ C do 2 foreach v, w ∈ children(c) do dist vw ← 0 3 foreach e = (v, w) ∈ E do 4 Determine v * , w * for which v * , w * ∈ children(LCA(v, w)) ∧ path(LCA(v, w), v) = (n 1 , v * , . . . , n k ) ∧ path(LCA(v, w), w) = (n 1 , w * , . . . , n l ) 5 dist v * w * ← dist v * w * + 1 6 foreach c ∈ C do 7</formula><p>Compute positions of children(c) using MDS and 1 dist vw as pairwise distance for v, w ∈ children(c) Overall runtime analysis for preprocessing: The overall runtime is dominated by the similarity computation and the creation of the reference map.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Layout Algorithm</head><p>For a hierarchically clustered graph G H = (V ∪C, E ∪H, r), we have to compute a Voronoi treemap layer for each cluster c ∈ C and its children to get the complete Voronoi treemap. A Voronoi treemap layer (or single layer Voronoi treemap) is a mapping of the children of c to a two-dimensional Voronoi diagram in the plane, where each child corresponds to a cell of the Voronoi treemap. A hierarchy layer is thus the union of all Voronoi treemap layers whose cluster node c has the same distance to the root.</p><p>Algorithm 2 describes the computation of a Voronoi treemap for a hierarchically clustered graph by using a queue instead of recursive function calls. An advantage of the queue is that one can easily parallelize the whole procedure, since each element in the queue can be handled separately, e.g., by a CPU core. We realized this by using a synchronized queue and by starting as many worker threads as there are CPU cores available. Each worker thread handles the while-loop of Algorithm 2 independently.</p><p>The algorithm starts with the root v = r and computes the centroid of the bounding region R v (Line 6). Then the reference map vectors M v of its children are scaled such that the resulting positions P v are contained in its bounding region R v (Line 7 to 9). After that, the resulting positions P v are used to initialize the Voronoi treemap computation for a single layer. For the next levels of the hierarchy, the same procedure is repeated recursively. Proof. For c ∈ C, n c = |children(c)| it holds that ∑ c∈C n c = n. It is clear that each node in C is in the queue exactly once. Thus, V is computed for each c ∈ C. Further, the computation of the single layer Voronoi treemap V can be done in O(k • |S| log |S|) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, where k is the constant fixed number of iterations one allows. It follows that the Algorithm 2: Voronoi treemap computation for a hierarchically clustered graph Input: At this point the search results have not been positioned yet. After the whole Voronoi treemap is computed, the positions of the search results are again determined by using the reference map and the centroid of the corresponding region. We scale the reference map vectors to fit into the given region and compute the node positions by adding the scaled reference map vector to the centroid of its corresponding region. We then anchor the search results at this position, but refine the layout by using Stress Majorization with 20 iterations. This allows the nodes to move, towards the search results that are similar to them, but the anchoring also limits this change to preserve the reference map.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Graph G H = (V ∪C, E ∪ H, r), region R r , Reference Map M = {r x ∈ R 2 | x ∈ V ∪C \ {r}} Output: Voronoi treemap 1 initialize queue Q 2 Enqueue(Q, r) 3 while Q = / 0 do 4 v ← Dequeue(Q) 5 S ← children(v) 6 centroid ← centroid of R v 7 M v ← {r x ∈ M|x ∈ S} 8 scale M v such that for each r x ∈ M v : (centroid + r x ) ∈ R v 9 P v ← {centroid + x : x ∈ M} 10 V<label>(</label></formula><p>Overlap Removal: After the layout has been computed, it is still possible that nodes overlap. Since for Stress Majorization the nodes are only positions without circumference, it is important to handle overlapping. The reduction of overlapping makes the overall visualization clearer for a viewer; but the clearness comes at the expense of some damage to the semantic representation.</p><p>To solve this problem, a spring embedder technique as suggested by Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> is applied. By introducing forces between overlapping nodes and then moving the nodes in direction of the forces, the overlapping is solved. Since the Voronoi regions constrain the possible positions, we have to take this into account when moving the nodes.</p><p>If the number of nodes is very large, this step could take longer than the overall layout computation. The computational complexity is clearly in O n 2 where n is the number of search results, which are shown on the screen. But since the number of results is small once we show the nodes and their dependencies, this technique works quite well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">RESULTS</head><p>In this section we will first elaborate some quantitative descriptive of the mental map stability and the aspect ratio, which we use to measure the mental map preservation. This is followed by an application of our approach on an archive of newspaper articles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Mental Map Stability</head><p>There are a lot of factors that affect the mental map. Since the Voronoi treemap algorithm is based on Lloyd's method of moving the sites to the center of the region, it is intuitive that the site movements mostly take place locally. We want to measure this intuition by comparing our algorithm result to some baseline cases, e.g., random placement.</p><p>In the following, we look at a single layer Voronoi treemap computation. The idea is to measure whether the initial positions, which result from the reference map, are more or less the same after the Voronoi treemap procedure.</p><p>Let S = {p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p n } be a set of n sites with p i ∈ R 2 , for i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. The Voronoi treemap computation leads to a layout S = {p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p n } with p i ∈ R 2 , for i ∈ {1, . . . , n}.</p><p>How similar are these layouts (S and S ) and how well is thus the mental map preserved?</p><p>Due to the Voronoi treemap computation, there are two main factors influencing the resulting layout:</p><p>• (initial site positions) These are derived from the reference map.</p><p>• (target areas of sites) These are derived from the search results and the hierarchy.</p><p>Although there are many measures for the mental map, many of them do not make sense for our method, since we are also trying to transform the hierarchy representation in reference to the search results. We thus derive the following measures from Bridgeman and Tamassia <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, which are similar to the ranking and the neighborhood measure. These measures are also known as orthogonal ordering and proximity in earlier work of Misue et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Ranking The ranking measure considers the relative horizontal and vertical positions of the points. For two sites p, q ∈ S it would be optimal for the following to hold:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">p x ≤ q x ⇒ p x ≤ p y and p y ≤ p y ⇒ p y ≤ p y .</formula><p>We measure the ranking by counting the created inversions of S in comparison with S for the x dimension:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">inversions(S, S ) := 1 n(n − 1) ∑ p∈S ∑ q∈S\{p} inv(p, q),<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where inv(p, q) := 1 if p x ≤ q x and p x &gt; q x 0 otherwise and analogous for the y-dimension.</p><p>Neighborhood The neighborhood measure comes from the desire that two neighboring objects should stay neighbors. For example, when driving in a complicated city one uses certain objects for easier navigation or for knowing when to turn left. Keeping the neighborhood thus reduces the confusion and the recognition of the underlying scheme. The relation neighborhood for two sites p, q ∈ S in our case means that their regions have a common bisector and are thus direct geometric neighbors. Since we cannot test the whole parameter space, we have to choose appropriate instances for testing the stability. We consider both aspects, initial coordinates and target areas, in our tests by generating different coordinate and target area distributions.  Coordinate Distribution:</p><p>Uniform: The coordinates for the sites are uniformly distributed over a rectangular area. We use this as a default setting for comparison.</p><p>Cluster: Since at least some clusters are expected to exist in the document collections, we simulate a clustered initialization by randomly selecting positions in a rectangular area and then creating coordinates with standard Gaussian distribution and a standard deviation of a quarter of the rectangle width. This should satisfy the case where the initialization points are partly clustered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Target Area Distribution:</head><p>Uniform: In this setting each site has the same weight which may occur when parts of the hierarchies have the same importance.</p><p>FewImportant: This case describes a situation in which a low number of sites has a higher importance than others. We give 10% of the sites a 60% higher weight.</p><p>Note that there are many more possible settings and distributions, but by using the above settings we can at least check for the case when the search results lead to significant change in the hierarchy visualization.</p><p>Counting the inversions of a layout gives us a quantitative measure; it is rather hard to assess this value. For this reason, we assess this value together with the results of randomly placing the sites. In addition to that, we use several other rectangular treemap methods to be able to make relative quality statements. These treemap methods should be seen as a push down of the worst case and not as comparison.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Placement Methods:</head><p>Random: This method just generates random new positions for the sites.</p><p>Squarified: Squarified treemap <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> is used as space filling technique to determine a rectangular partitioning. The centers of the rectangles are used for counting the inversions. The resulting rectangles have good aspect ratio.</p><p>SliceAndDice: One of the first treemap techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, which creates a rectangular partitioning. It keeps a given linear ordering but has bad aspect ratio.</p><p>Voronoi: Voronoi treemap placement that iteratively moves the sites to the center of their region and adapts the weight according to the target areas.</p><p>As one can see in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8(a)</ref>, the number of inversions rises for the Voronoi treemap technique as the number of iterations increases, until it converges to 10% of the number of possible inversions. Further, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8(b)</ref> shows that 50% of the initial direct neighborhood relations are preserved, even for the case where few sites have high weights. This means that the overall structure is mostly maintained. Nevertheless, there can also be outlying cases, where this is not the case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Aspect Ratio</head><p>The aspect ratio describes the proportion of the width and height of a visual object. Thus, it is an important characteristic for the area perception of the user.</p><p>We define the aspect ratio of a region R p as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">aspectRatio(R p ) := min width height , height width ,</formula><p>where We measure the aspect ratio of the Voronoi regions after each iteration. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 9</ref> shows that the aspect ratio improves very fast after few iterations. In average, it converges between 0.8 and 0.9, which is a very good aspect ratio. The other distributions behave similarly.</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">width = max (x,y)∈R p (x) − min (x,y)∈R p (x) and height = max (x,y)∈R p (y) − min (x,y)∈R p (y).</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Application Example</head><p>We demonstrate our approach on a collection of 6,000 Germanlanguage news media articles that are clustered hierarchically by media and country. All articles appeared the same day and media names have been abbreviated for consistent length of labels.</p><p>The document graph is defined with a distance threshold of 0.3. Some pairs of news media are connected by sets of densely connected articles. See the cells of "ots" and "finanzn" in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 1(b)</ref> for an example. This is mostly due to articles from the same news agency, or coverage of similar topics. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 10</ref> shows the hits of a single-word query for "user". On the left, there is a dense set of closely related articles, which turn out to report about the same event; the cooperation of two media groups and their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 10</ref>. Query hits for keyword "user." Two dense document sets, which are highly connected with each other, come to the fore. After inspecting the representative the user could decide to switch to the other cluster, because he is searching another type of document joint user base. The cluster is local because of the close proximity of business-related news media. It is also directly visible where in the hierarchy these articles are distributed. After inspecting a representative of these articles, the user can decide to inspect a completely different area in the map, if he wants different type of articles. The second dense set of documents on the right had several different topics, which resulted in a wider distribution of the nodes. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 11</ref> shows that the preservation of the reference map works quite well. Although some cells jump to different places, the relation between two cells is retained in most cases, which can be seen by following the black marked cells from (a) to (c). Although they are filling the available space, the relative positions are retained approximately. The hierarchical structure is also clearly visible by cell inclusion.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 11</ref>(c) one can furthermore see how the search results are distributed along the hierarchy. Another observation is that Germany (DE), although it has much more results, is a lot smaller than Austria (AT). Since we incorporated the document score of Lucene in this example to adapt the cell areas, this means that the results lying in Austria got a much higher score by Lucene. In contrast to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 1(b)</ref> there are nearly no links between the search hits in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 11(c)</ref>, which means that the search hits are very dissimilar. While Switzerland (CH) plays an important role in the query of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 1(b)</ref>, its cell is very small in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 11</ref>(c) (upper left corner), since it contained only one search hit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Scalability</head><p>There are two aspects in terms of scalability. The quadratic runtime of the preprocessing step is clearly very slow, but since this can be computed in advance, it does not affect the user directly at query time. The runtime of the layout algorithm, which needs to be computed at query time, indeed affects the user. In our application example the bottleneck was clearly the Voronoi treemap computation. Although the response time was below one second on a Core i7-2600K CPU @ 3.40GHz with four cores, this could be a problem if the hierarchy size is too big. An easy solution for this would be to collapse parts of the hierarchy, which would also limit the number of shown objects on the screen. With a fast implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, the computation time of a Voronoi treemap consisting of a hierarchy with 1300 nodes, would be below one second with the CPU mentioned above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DISCUSSION</head><p>We described a visualization approach for organizing search results by using a reference map. In contrast to previous approaches, our method shows the important parts of the search space by assigning them more area. By combining the reference map with Voronoi treemaps, the overall structure is mostly maintained. Further, we applied techniques from dynamic graph layout to assign query results to the map.</p><p>The second element of our contribution is the application of our method to an archive of newspaper articles.</p><p>Although our approach seems to work well on the German news data, a limitation of the Voronoi treemaps become visible. Since the Voronoi treemap computation is based on Lloyd's method for centroidal Voronoi diagrams, it yields only local optimal area represen-tation. This can result in misrepresentation of areas, if only few cells are filling a region.</p><p>Furthermore, the iterative process of the Voronoi treemap computation is time-consuming. As demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, running time could be reduced significantly by using heuristic techniques, which lower the number of iterations.</p><p>In contrast to this, the preprocessing step in our approach is clearly the bottleneck in terms of computation time. This could possibly be speeded up, because its result is only a two-dimensional vector for each hierarchy node and each document item.</p><p>Although the postprocessing forces a limitation on the number of shown search hits, this limit is well beyond practically relevant numbers of displayed query hits. Nevertheless, this limit could be pushed even farther by utilizing faster node overlap removal techniques.</p><p>Other issues to address in future work would be a user study to analyze the influence of our approach on the users' search behavior and extension of our approach to non hierarchical data. Finally, the approach could be extended to highly dynamic data, by incrementally extending the reference map for new data items.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 11</ref>. Example of a search query including score weightings: Successive extension of the search query adapts the visualization with the reference map (a)-(c) and finally organizes the search results (c). The black-bordered cells show that the overall structure is mostly maintained although they are moving around to fill the whole space.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>for an example.</figDesc></figure>
