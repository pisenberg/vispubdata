				<p>Storyline visualization is a technique used to depict the temporal dynamics of social interactions. This visualization technique was first introduced as a hand-drawn illustration in XKCD&apos;s &quot;Movie Narrative Charts&quot; [21]. If properly constructed, the visualization can convey both global trends and local interactions in the data. However, previous methods for automating storyline visualizations are overly simple, failing to achieve some of the essential principles practiced by professional illustrators. This paper presents a set of design considerations for generating aesthetically pleasing and legible storyline visualizations. Our layout algorithm is based on evolutionary computation, allowing us to effectively incorporate multiple objective functions. We show that the resulting visualizations have significantly improved aesthetics and legibility compared to existing techniques.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Social interactions are often visually represented by graphs depicting the relationships between entities in social networks. Traditional techniques for incorporating the temporal aspect of social interactions into visualizations either use animations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> or layer graphs of different time steps in a three-dimensional space <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p><p>Yet these techniques have limitations in conveying information. Studies have shown that although animations are engaging and attractive, they often fail to convey subtle trends in data <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Moreover, applying animation to graphs potentially results in poor visual aesthetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Three-dimensional visualizations, including layered graphs, also often suffer from view-dependent visibility issues and perspective distortion of the information.</p><p>Storyline visualizations portrays the temporal dynamics of social interactions in a single image plane. This visualization technique was first introduced by Munroe in the XKCD webcomic "Movie Narrative Charts" <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In this comic strip, the visualization was presented as a hand-drawn illustration summarizing characters' interactions in movies. <ref type="figure">Figure 11B</ref> shows an illustration excerpted from XKCD.</p><p>While several visualization researchers have been inspired by this work and have proposed visualization systems using its visual concepts (see section 2.2), little research has been done on automatic generation of storyline visualizations whose aesthetics and legibility match those of the original illustration. A study of techniques to generate elegant and legible storyline visualizations would not only provide scientists with means to effectively communicate data-driven information, but would also provide researchers a foundation upon which to further explore potential applications of the visualization.</p><p>This paper presents the techniques we have developed for generating storyline visualizations with improved clarity. Our techniques include an algorithm for computing the layout of the visualization and methods for adjusting the geometry of individual lines to improve visual aesthetics. This paper also introduces the design principles and aesthetic dimensions of the visualization, based on the guidelines practiced by professional illustrators and visualization researchers, and presents a data structure optimized for computing the layout of storyline visualizations.</p><p>We evaluate our techniques by conducting two studies. The first study discusses the advantages and disadvantages of our technique compared to existing techniques. The second study demonstrates the flexibility of our technique by augmenting the storyline visualization with additional context and shows that our method is able to generate an almost identical storyline visualization to that drawn by a professional illustrator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>In this section, we discuss two related topics to this research. One topic is on methods to improve aesthetics and legibility of visualizations, and the other is on previous visualization systems that adopt storyline visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Aesthetics and Legibility</head><p>The improvement of aesthetics and legibility in visualizations has been the subject of many studies. Concerns for visual clutter in visualizations vary from type to type. Agrawala et al. discussed the importance of computationally constructing visualizations as intuitive as handcrafted illustrations and provided guidelines for identifying underlying design principles from hand-drawn illustrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. A survey of general techniques for reducing visual clutter in visualizations can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Storyline visualizations use a collection of lines to depict a timeline of dynamic social interactions. Parallel coordinates and graph visualizations are two prominent visualizations that make use of lines, and extensive research has been conducted on how to improve their aesthetics and legibility.</p><p>Parallel Coordinates. Smoothing is a conventional and effective technique applied to many visualization systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, and several researchers have also applied smoothing to improve the legibility of parallel coordinates. Graham and Kennedy proposed a method for replacing the traditional poly-lines with smooth curving lines to improve the traceability of individual lines, producing paths with continuous gradients across axes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Moustafa and Wegman presented an interpolation technique for generating smooth parallel coordinates, demonstrating that smooth lines not only improve the traceability of lines, but are also able to convey structural trends in the data better than poly-lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. In this paper, in addition to applying curves, we also present a technique for adjusting control points that determine the curvature of the deviation to further smooth lines while preserving the overall visualization's aspect ratio.</p><p>Graph Visualizations. The aesthetics and legibility of graphs are traditionally measured by three categories: edge crossovers, edge wiggles (bends), and space efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. A significant amount of research has been dedicated to graph layout. Battista et al. surveyed a variety of graph drawing methods in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Although some techniques, such as edge dispersing <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and edge clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, significantly enhance the readability of graphs, these techniques are destructive with respect to the visibility and traceability of individual lines and therefore are less relevant to our work.</p><p>One particular area in graph drawing whose aesthetic and legibility criteria significantly resemble those of storyline visualization is metro map drawing. Metro maps are a graph drawing technique developed by Harry Beck in 1933 for the London Underground which produces aesthetically pleasing and legible graph visualizations by applying a schematic layout to convey the topology of metro station networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Due to its ability to provide viewers with an intuitive overview of the city, while maintaining the visibility and traceability of individual metro lines, many researchers have employed a metro map metaphor to enhance the aesthetics and legibility of their visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. In order to automate the generation of metro map visualizations, Nöllenburg and Wolff presented a method for rearranging graph layouts while maintaining their topology using mixed-integer programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Although their method could significantly improve the aesthetics and legibility of graph visualizations, it was based on a graph whose topological layout was predefined. Since optimizing storyline visualizations include retrieving the optimal topological layout of individual lines, this method cannot be simply applied to storyline visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Storyline Visualization</head><p>Storyline visualization is a technique that portrays the temporal dynamics of social interactions by projecting the timeline of the interaction onto an axis. In XKCD's hand-drawn illustration "Movie Narrative Charts", each movie character's life-span was represented by a chronological line which converges and diverges with other characters' lines, depicting their interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Ogievetsky's "PlotWeaver" <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> computationally aids the process of generating storyline visualizations. With this application, a user successfully recreated the Star Wars storyline visualization in 33 minutes. However, "PlotWeaver" requires significant effort on the user's part for specifying the layout.</p><p>Many researchers have also been inspired by XKCD's storyline illustration. Reda et al. introduced a technique to visualize the evolution of community structure in dynamic social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Kim et al. presented a visualization of genealogical data over time using storyline visualizations to convey the marital status between people <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Cui et al., while not explicitly referencing <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, developed a method for visualizing the evolution of topics by combining storyline visualization with stacked graphs, allowing analysts to view the intricate interplay of topics in the greater context of time-varying textual data <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>While these different applications of storyline visualizations have shown their ability to convey temporal relational information, most of these studies only address system-specific issues regarding the visibility and legibility of the visualization. However, some studies on general approaches to generating storyline visualizations have been conducted. Ogawa and Ma presented a design study using storyline visualization to visualize the temporal dynamics between developers in a software development history <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Although the methods discussed in their study also involved general approaches for creating storyline visualizations, the layout heuristics discussed in their work were overly simple and failed to achieve some of the essential principles practiced by professional illustrators.</p><p>Our work focuses on developing techniques for automating the generation of aesthetically pleasing and legible storyline visualizations. We focus on optimizing their layout and line geometry. For each technique, we compare and evaluate the resulting visualization with a visualization based on existing techniques. Our work contributes to the visualization of social dynamics not only by facilitating an effective data-driven presentation/communication tool, but also by providing researchers with an adaptive framework for apply and augment storylines visualizations to various visual analytics tools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">VISUAL ENCODING</head><p>Storyline visualization consists of a series of lines, going from left to right along the time-axis, that converge and diverge in the course of their paths. Each line in this visualization represents a unique social entity (character) in the data. The starting and ending points of each line represent the lifespan of the corresponding character. Lines representing interacting characters are bundled together during the time period of their interaction, causing them to converge as they start interacting and to diverge as they stop interacting.</p><p>The composition of this visual representation of temporal social interactions can be described by three design principles, the first two of which are from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>:</p><p>1. Lines representing interacting characters must be adjacent. 2. Otherwise, lines must not be adjacent. 3. A line must not deviate unless it converges or diverges with another line. The third design principle allows us to directly interpret any deviation as a change taking place in the social interaction.</p><p>In addition to these design principles, we define three metrics to measure the quality of the visualization. These metrics are based on previous research that discusses the legibility and aesthetics of visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</p><p>• Line wiggles • Line crossovers • White space gaps Line wiggles are deviations in lines that often interrupt the continuity of the visual flow of the visualization. Therefore, minimizing line wiggles in the visualization can significantly enhance its legibility. Line crossovers occur when multiple lines intersect, causing occlusion. These crossovers also cause visual discontinuities in the visualization, and therefore should be minimized. White space gaps refer to vacant areas without any visual entities in the visualization. These vacant spaces are essential parts of storyline visualizations as they separate the lines of characters that are not interacting. However, excessive spaces are waste of screen real estate and may mislead viewers to interpret these spaces as contextual distances between characters.</p><p>Based on these design principles and quality metrics, the computation of the layout in storyline visualization can be described as a combinatory optimization problem with respect to the visualization quality metrics, constrained by the design principles. The design and layout of other visual entities, such as labels and indicators for characters on furlough, are not within the scope of our work, and we employ the methods introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> for these entities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DATA</head><p>The basic form of the data applied in this visualization is simply a chronological list of interactions between various characters. These interactions between characters can be separated into a series of interaction sessions, each session representing the time span of a set of interacting characters.</p><p>More precisely, we define an interaction session as a unit which holds three attributes:</p><p>• initiation time,</p><p>• duration, and • members. Initiation time corresponds to the time when the interaction session begins. Duration corresponds to the duration of the interaction session. Members corresponds to the set of characters involved in the interaction session. Each interaction session represents a time slot in the data where its members are interacting. Note that any change in the formation of members (e.g., a character leaving or joining) indicates a separate interaction session.</p><p>Therefore, based on the design principles discussed in Section 3, lines representing members in an interaction session should be adjacent, while maintaining a marginal distance from other lines. These lines also should not deviate during the time slot of the interaction session, because no lines converge on or diverge from them during that time period. Hence, each interaction session occupies a rectangular block of pixels in the visualization, where its height and width correspond to its number of members and its duration, and where its left edge's x-coordinate is aligned to the initiation time. Similar data structure have also been applied in several visualization systems in order to simplify the layout computation for convoluted lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> This data structure effectively aligns the data with the design principles and facilitates efficient computation by reducing the problem from calculating the layout for lines to calculating the layout for blocks (which represent interaction sessions). In this paper, we denote the data as a set of interaction sessions I = {i 1 , i 2 , ...., i n }, where i k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) consists of an initiation time t k , duration d k , and members <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows an example set of interaction sessions based on the story Alice's Adventures in Wonderland <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows how the interaction sessions in this data are laid out in the visualization. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Interaction sessions based on a part of the story Alice's Adventures in Wonderland <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This data corresponds to the part where Alice leaves her sister to follow the White Rabbit and tumbles down the rabbit hole.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M k = {c i , c j , ...}(M k ⊂ M).</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">i k t k d k M k i 1 0 4 SISTER, ALICE i 2 4 0 WHITE RABBIT i 3 5 5 ALICE,WHITE RABBIT i 4 5 217 SISTER i 5 11 21 WHITE RABBIT i 6 11 6 ALICE Fig. 1</formula><p>. A storyline visualization of the data shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Each box, surrounding lines, corresponds to the labeled interaction session in the data. We can observe Alice diverging from her sister and converging with the White Rabbit as she leaves her sister to follow the rabbit.</p><p>Although the discussion of storyline visualization has so far focused on its ability to visually summarize stories, storyline visualization is not limited to story data and can be applied to a much wider range of data. For example, temporal communities detected by clustering algorithms in time-varying graphs can be interpreted as groups of characters with strong connections. Therefore, by converting these temporal communities into a collection of interaction sessions, storyline visualization can effectively visualize the evolution of communities in a dataset. This conversion can be achieved by simply dividing the temporal communities into time segments, which would represent interaction sessions, based on the formation of the community members. Hence, splitting the temporal community at all time steps where there is a change in the formation of the community member will achieve this process.</p><p>In this paper, we use two types of data to examine our methods. One type is based on interactions between characters from movies which are often small in scale. The other type is based on temporal communities extracted from time-varying network datasets which are often large in scale. The movies are Star Wars, The Matrix, and Inception. These datasets were manually extracted from the actual movies and other publicly available information. These datasets are also made available at <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. For the time-varying network, we use the Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) network dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">LAYOUT</head><p>In this section we present a method for computing the layout of storyline visualizations based on a set of interaction sessions I. While storing interaction sessions in the specified data format simplifies the layout problem as discussed in Section 4, it remains a combinatory optimization problem with respect to the visualization quality metrics presented in Section 3. The solution to this problem is nontrivial and depends on the formula chosen for the objective function.</p><p>We propose a layout computation approach based on genetic algorithms (GA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. GA's are a class of iterative search algorithms for approximating the solutions of optimization problems by simulating the process of biological evolution and survival of the fittest. GA's start with a set of randomly generated genomes which each encodes a potential solution to the problem. These genomes are then evaluated by an evaluation function and replaced by a new set of genomes in a new "generation". The genomes in the new generation consist of parts of the elite genomes (i.e., the genomes with the best evaluations) and their sibling genomes from the previous generation. Sibling genomes are generated by swapping parts of the genome sequence between pairs of randomly selected elite genomes. This swapping of genome sequences is referred to as crossover. In order to prevent the algorithm from falling into a local optima, GA's also produce an occasional mutation in the sibling genomes, where part of the genome sequence is swapped with a random value. The probability of mutation occurrence is dependent on the mutation rate, which is set by the developer. In our prototype experiment, we fix the number of elite genomes to 50% of the initial population and the mutation rate to 0.6. Also, the initial population size and the number of generations to iterate are defined accordingly to the size of the data.</p><p>Applying GA to compute the layout typically results in a suboptimal design. Though suboptimal, GA facilitates a broad range of search and can robustly approximate the global optima. This robustness serves well for computing storyline layouts whose search area contains several local optima. For example, conventional optimization methods, such as local search, are prone to fixate on a local optima with poor layout when multiple interaction sessions need to be adjusted as a set in order to achieve better layouts. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows a flowchart of the algorithm for computing the layout of storyline visualizations. Decoding the genome to its phenotype, which in this case is the overall layout of the lines in the visualization, goes through three steps of computation:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Algorithm Overview</head><p>• laying out interaction sessions, • rearranging lines, and • removing white spaces.</p><p>The first step is a direct translation from the genome sequence to the layout of interaction sessions. In this step, each interaction session is assigned to a horizontal slot which defines its topological position with respect to other interaction sessions.</p><p>The second step takes the topological layout of interaction sessions defined by the genome sequence and computes the appropriate layout for the lines by rearranging the internal layout (order) of the line segments in each interaction session. In this step, the topological positions of the lines are defined with respect to other lines in the visualization.</p><p>The third step takes the layout of the lines determined by the previous step and converts it into a space efficient layout while maintaining the topological placement of individual lines. This step finalizes the overall layout of the storyline visualization based on the original genome sequence, which gets evaluated and examined by the following GA processes.</p><p>After the layout of a genome is computed, each genome's fitness is calculated by evaluating its layout. Equation 1 shows the evaluation function applied in our prototype experiment. Line wiggles and line crossovers for character c represent the number of slots' borders and the number of characters' lines the line crosses over. In our experiment, we found that setting C w and C c to 3 and 1 provide reasonably desirable results. Thus, for the visualizations presented in this paper, we have employed this setting. Although we have discussed the importance of having less excessive white space in the visualization, we found that, in most of our experiments, optimizing against space efficiency had a significantly lower effect on the visualization's legibility compared to reducing the number of line wiggles and crossovers. Therefore, in our prototype experiment, we have removed it from the evaluation metric.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Fitness = ∀c∈M ∑ (C w •Wiggle (c) +C c •Crossover (c) )</formula><p>(1) <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. The GA flowchart for computing the layout of storyline visualizations. There are three steps for calculating the layout of a genome. First, the layout of the interaction sessions is determined by the genome sequence. Next, the lines in each interaction session are rearranged in order to minimize wiggles and crossovers. Finally, unnecessary white spaces between interaction sessions are removed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Layout of Interaction Sessions</head><p>In this step, the layout of interaction sessions is decoded from each genome. The layout is based on a set of horizontal slots that divide the screen space along the y-axis. Each of these slots has the capacity to accommodate blocks of interaction sessions as long as they do not overlap in time. Therefore, in order to accommodate all interaction sessions in these slots, it is necessary to prepare at least the same number of slots as the maximum number of interaction sessions contemporary in the data.</p><p>Each genome consists of a list of integer values whose length is the number of interaction sessions n(= |I|). Therefore, a genome can be denoted as [g 1 , g 2 , ...g n ] (0 ≤ g k &lt; m ∀k ∈ n), where m is the number of slots prepared. Here, g k represents the index of the slot which interaction session i k belongs. For example, if g 4 = 3, then the set of lines (block) representing i 4 is assigned to the third slot. A visual example is also shown in the left of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. If the genome happens to assign two interaction sessions to a slot causing an overlap, the following process of computing the layout is skipped, and the genome is given a low evaluation indicating that the genome is unlikely to survive the evolutionary process.</p><p>By providing each slot with a certain amount of padding from the neighboring slots, this step secures the marginal distance between concurrent interaction sessions in the visualization.</p><p>Although this step readily produces a storyline visualization layout that complies with the set of design principles, the visualization still contains excessive number of line crossovers and unnecessary screen space causing significant visual clutter. The following steps address these problems and help optimize the visualization with respect to the quality metrics based on the topology of the interaction session layout derived from the genome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Rearranging Lines</head><p>This step takes the slot-based layout of interaction sessions derived from a genome and determines the order of the line segments in each interaction session and its alignment in order to reduce unnecessary wiggles and crossovers. An example of how these rearrangements reduce unnecessary wiggles and crossovers can also be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure  2</ref>.</p><p>Since line crossovers only occur when there is a change in the order of lines in subsequent time steps, the key to minimize line crossovers is to maintaining the orders of the line segments as much as possible at each time step. Reducing unnecessary wiggles can also be simply achieved by adjusting the vertical alignment of the interaction sessions within its slot (e.g., the blue line in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). This rearranging step starts by classifying the line segments in each interaction session into four categories: static lines, rising lines, dropping lines, and emerging lines. The category of a line segment is determined by comparing the slots between its current interaction session and it's previous interaction session. Static lines refer to the line segments that stay in the same slot. Rising lines refer to the line segments that switch to a slot higher than the previous slot. Dropping lines refer to the line segments that switch to a slot lower than the previous slot.</p><p>Emerging lines refer to the line segments that are new and do not exist in the previous time step.</p><p>After classifying all line segments, the process assigns each line segment its vertical alignment (y-coordinate). This assignment is conducted one interaction session at a time, and in order of initiation times. This is because the ordering of line segments within an interaction session affects the ordering of line segments in subsequent interaction sessions. For example, the ordering in i 3 affects the ordering in i 4 in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Therefore, to maintain consistency in line alignments, it is crucial to conduct this rearrangement in sequence.</p><p>The process of assigning y-coordinates to line segments in an interaction session also follows a specific order. This allows both objectives, minimizing crossovers and removing unnecessary wiggles, to be accomplished in an efficient fashion. The order of assignment is:</p><p>1. static lines, 2. rising and dropping lines, and 3. emerging lines. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> shows a flowchart of how each line segment in an interaction session is assigned its y-coordinate. First, line segments classified as static lines are assigned the same y-coordinates as they were in the previous interaction session. However, this initial assignment leaves some gaps between line segments due to terminating or deviating (rising/dropping) lines from previous interaction sessions. In order to fill these gaps, static line segments are bundled together while maintaining their y-orders.</p><p>Next, the rising and dropping line segments are assigned their ycoordinates by appending them to the existing bundle. The positions for these line segments are decided based on the following guidelines: Rising line segments are set directly under the bottom line segment in the interaction session, and dropping line segments are set directly above the top line segment in the interaction session. This prevents merging lines from unnecessarily crossing over the bundled static line segments. The third example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> shows how these lines merge into the interaction session.</p><p>In addition, in order to avoid crossovers between these merging lines, line segments in rising and dropping lines also follow a specific assignment order. These lines are first sorted based on their ycoordinates in the previous time step. By appending rising line segments to the bottom of the interaction session in order of highest to lowest in the previous time step, we can avoid disrupting the order of these lines and therefore prevent rising lines from crossing over each other. Similarly, dropping line segments are appended to the top of the interaction session in order of lowest to highest in the previous time step in order to prevent them from crossing over each other.</p><p>Finally, emerging lines are appended to the edges of the interaction session. The decision to append each emerging line to either the top or the bottom is determined by the direction of its future deviation. For example, if an emerging line deviates upward in the future, it is better to append the line to the top of the interaction session than to the bottom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Removing White Spaces</head><p>While the outcome of the rearrangement step provides a slot-based layout that minimizes the number of deviating lines and crossovers, merely using this layout would result in excessive amounts of white space due to the sparseness of interaction sessions relative to the amount of screen space dedicated to each slot. These excessive white spaces in the visualization not only are a waste of screen space, but also are prone to mislead the viewers in believing the parted areas are irrelevant to one another due to its disconnected visual.</p><p>Therefore, in order to prevent such misleading effects, it is critical for the layout computation to include the removal of unnecessary white space to determine the final layout. This section presents our method for removing unnecessary white space from the slot-based layout while maintaining the topological layout of the lines.</p><p>The method for removing white space starts by dividing each slot into a set of slot segments. Each slot segment consists of a set of contiguous interaction sessions which share lines and belong to the same slot. By contiguous interaction sessions, we mean interaction sessions that share lines. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> shows an example of how a slot is divided into slot segments. The reason for generating these slot segments is to determine the units that can be adjusted in order to construct a space-efficient layout while maintaining the topology of the previously derived layout. Since the interaction sessions that belong to each slot segment were already optimally aligned in previous steps, the internal line layout of these interaction sessions should not be altered in the course of white space removal. Thus, in this stage of the layout computation, the overall layout is tuned by adjusting the placement of slot segments.</p><p>Although each slot segment adopts a unique geometry according to the sizes and alignment of its composing interaction sessions, since Algorithm 1 Removing White Space (Baseline Approach) Input: A set of slots each containing a set of slot segments.</p><p>Bottom(ss i ,t) returns the y-coordinate of the bottom edge of slot segment ss i at time segment t, and Top(ss i ,t) returns the top. 1: Initialize the baseline function g(t) = 0 : ∀t(time segment); 2: for each slot s i from bottom do 3:</p><p>for each slot segment ss j which belongs to s i do 4:</p><p>Let T be the set of time segments in ss j ;</p></div>

In our prototype experiment, we choose a simple method to compress the layout by stacking slot segments on top of one another starting from a pre-determined baseline. This process incrementally layers the slot segments on top of the baseline starting from the bottom slot to the top slot while maintaining the minimum required padding between interaction sessions. A detailed description of the algorithm of this approach is given in Algorithm 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Optimizing the Computation</head><p>Although GA's are scalable and can handle large, complex problems, their computation time is significantly affected by the size of the problem. In general, the time complexity of GA's is dependent on two aspects of the genome sequence configuration. The first is the length of the genome sequence, which in our case corresponds to the number of interaction sessions n, and the other is the number of integer values used in the genomes, which corresponds to the number of slots m.</p><p>Therefore, the complexity of the GA's search space in our algorithm can be denoted as O(m n ) which grows polynomially and exponentially against the number of slots and interaction sessions.</p><p>However, by pre-computing the connections (i.e., the continuity in membership) between subsequent interaction sessions, some interaction sessions can be affiliated with other interaction sessions, reducing the genome length required to encode the overall layout. This affiliation is based on the number of lines that subsequent interaction sessions share. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> illustrates how affiliating subsequent interaction sessions can reduce genome length. In this example, an interaction session i x with 6 members and a subsequent interaction session i y with 5 members both share 5 members. Although these interactions are separately assigned slots, they are likely to converge to the same slot in order to optimize the overall layout and to avoid wiggle in the lines of shared members. Hence, by affiliating i y with i x , genomes would not have to encode the placement of i y and would simply propagate the slot given to i x to i y . <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. An example of affiliating interaction session i y with i x . Interaction sessions that share the majority of their members can be affiliated with one another to reduce the overall genome length.</p><p>The following conditions determine when two interaction sessions i x and i y should be merged. Condition 1 indicates that i y must be an interaction session which starts in the time step following the termination of i x ; hence, i x and i y must be a pair of subsequent interaction sessions. This condition ensures that the trajectories of the shared lines between i x and i y directly depend on the layout of these interaction sessions and therefore would gain legibility by becoming aligned. Condition 2 indicates that more than half of the members in interaction session i x must remain in i y . Therefore, aligning i y in the same slot as i x would maximize the number of static lines sent out by i x and minimize the number of line wiggles. Condition 3 indicates that more than half of the members in interaction session i y come from i x . Therefore, aligning i y with i x would maximize the number of static lines i y receives and minimize the number of line wiggles. In summary, given a pair of subsequent interaction sessions i x and i y , conditions <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(2) and</ref>(3) are necessary and sufficient to conclude that placing i x and i y in the same slot contributes to the legibility of the layout by minimizing the number of deviating lines between time steps.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">t x + d x + 1 ≡ t y (1) |M x ∩ M y | &gt; |M x |/2 (2) |M x ∩ M y | &gt; |M y |/2<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Based on these conditions, all pairs of interaction sessions are examined to see if any affiliation is possible. These affiliations are then preserved, and all i y affiliated with i x are discounted from the genome sequence and are linked to the value which determines the slot of i x .</p><p>This optimization is especially effective for data regarding communities in time-varying networks. Temporal communities in timevarying networks often break up into multiple interaction sessions due to frequent structural changes. However, most of these changes are minor relative to the remaining members of the communities and therefore can be disregarded by affiliating the separate interaction sessions. For example, in the MID network dataset, which consists of 196 nations and 740 time steps, the genome length was reduced from 1714 to 432, allowing the algorithm to gain a considerable speedup.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">LINE GEOMETRY ADJUSTMENTS</head><p>The GA-based algorithm proposed in Section 5 facilitates computation of a legible layout for storyline visualizations based on the quality metrics discussed in Section 3. However, optimizing the line arrangements alone is not sufficient to meet the aspired aesthetics and legibility of storyline visualizations, especially for large, complex data.</p><p>There are two visual properties other than the layout which contribute to the overall aesthetics and legibility of storyline visualizations. One property is the visual flow of storylines which allows viewers to smoothly follow each line in the visualization. The other property is the traceability/clarity of individual lines which allows viewers to follow a line of interest without getting lost in the visualization.</p><p>In this section, we describe techniques for adjusting line geometry in order to improve the legibility of the generated storyline visualizations with respect to these two visual properties. For each technique, we first specify the storyline visualization's feature causing the visual interference with respect to the corresponding visual property, and then present our technique to address the problem. In order to demonstrate the effects of our techniques, we also provide a pair of figures showing the visualization before and after the technique is applied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Line Relaxation</head><p>One feature of the generated storyline visualizations is that all deviations in line trajectories are compressed into a single time slot, which inherently prevents lines from smoothly transitioning between subsequent time steps. This is because the layout is computed based on interaction sessions, and deviating lines are mere connectors between subsequent interaction sessions.</p><p>Directly plotting interaction sessions has its own benefits; for example, viewers can accurately tell when and for how long characters of interest were interacting with whom. However, the jagged lines often interfere with the viewer's horizontal visual flow and make the timeline of the story hard to follow. Therefore, smoothing the line trajectories would significantly improve intuitiveness and comprehensibility of the story.</p><p>This lack of smoothness in line trajectories was addressed by adjusting the visualization's aspect ratio in previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. Elongating the visualization in the horizontal direction allows lines to deviate less drastically. However, this increases the screen space occupied by a single time slot, inherently limiting the amount of displayable information.  We introduce a technique for smoothing lines without adjusting the aspect ratio while maintaining contextual information by modifying the control points that define line geometry. This smoothing relaxes deviations by receding the control points along the horizontal axis.</p><p>However, some control points are critical for representing the timeline of events, and receding them would distort the information represented in the visualization. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref> shows examples of line relaxation based on receding control points. One of the examples in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref> shows successful line smoothing while maintaining the visualization's contextual information, while the other example shows how line relaxation can distort the information in the visualization.</p><p>Formula 2 describes the conditions for receding character c's control point at x k . This condition effectively filters out critical control points which are not adjustable during the line relaxation process and maintains the accuracy of the visualization. Here, x k represents the k-th x-coordinate (i.e., time step) in the control points of a line which are assigned to the start and end of the line and each point where the line deviates. Therefore, x k + 1 indicates the following time step. We also define Y (c i , x k ) as a function which returns the y-coordinate of the line representing character c i at x k , and C(c i , x k ) as a function which returns the companion members of the line representing c i at x k . This equation essentially states that control points where lines either converge or diverge cannot be receded.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">x k ← x k ± 1, if ∀c i ∈ C(c, x k ) : Y (c i ) = Y (c i , x k ∓ 1), C(c, x k ) ∈ C(c, x k ∓ 1)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>We found that although smooth lines improve legibility, excessive relaxation of lines can turn viewers away. We believe that this is because over-ambiguous line silhouettes make deviations so subtle that viewers perceive them as negligiable.</p><p>In order to prevent over-relaxation of lines, we have chosen to employ Beck's schematic metro map design to moderate line relaxation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. We have applied an objective function to the line relaxation such that the deviation angle is closest to 45 • . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref> shows two storyline visualizations. One is presented without line relaxation, and the other is presented with line relaxation. Although the visualization with relaxed lines loses certain detailed information, as discussed above, the smooth trajectories allow viewers to easily follow the timeline from left to right.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Deemphasizing Lines</head><p>The other feature of storyline visualizations is that individual lines become hard to trace as the number of lines increase. This is due to the limited number of distinguishable colors that can be used simultaneously, and to the increased occlusion caused by additional deviating lines. Therefore, adjusting the presentation of lines in order to enhance the definition of individual lines is critical for large scale storyline visualizations.</p><p>We have developed a method for deemphasizing certain line segments by allowing lines to change width dynamically. This method focuses on deviating line segments and thins them out. However, deemphasizing line segments inherently affects the overall impression of the visualization and therefore risks misleading viewers. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows three storyline visualization examples portraying the communities derived from of the MID network dataset. The time period shown is from 1941 to 1946 during World War II (WWII), and the communities are formed based on the degree of involvement in the disputes. First, the visualization is shown without any lines deemphasized. Next, the visualization is shown with all deviating line segments deemphasized. Finally, the visualization is shown with only some deviating line segments deemphasized. In this last visualization, only deviating line segments in which the y-coordinate displacement exceeds a certain threshold are deemphasized. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref> shows a series of closeup views of the convoluted areas highlighted in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>.</p><p>By comparing these visualizations, it is clear that deemphasizing deviating line segments not only allows for perception of detailed structures in convoluted areas by reducing occlusion, but also emphasizes the separation between groups of lines by minimizing the pixel coverage in the spaces between groups. However, as mentioned above, some groups in the completely deemphasized visualization lose extreme amounts of pixel coverage. This excessive loss of volume disrupts the visual consistency of the silhouette of the bundled lines, which represents the temporal evolution of communities, and this may mislead viewers. Since most intra-community deviations contain little y-coordinate displacement relative to inter-community deviations, moderating thin line segments based on the amount of y-coordinate displacement produces an intermediate visualization which retains the visual consistency of community geometries while clarifying the detailed structures of convoluted areas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">EVALUATION</head><p>In this section, we evaluate our technique for generating storyline visualizations through two studies. The first study compares the layout derived from our GA process to previous techniques. The second study demonstrates the flexibility of the evolutionary computationbased method we present in this paper by augmenting storyline visualizations with spatial information. Deemphasizing deviating lines significantly reduces visual clutter which is mostly caused by occlusion. However, deemphasizing all deviating lines (Complete) has little effect on the traceability of individual lines compared to the moderately deemphasized visualization. <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. Storyline visualizations of communities during the WWII in MID network dataset applied with different scale of de-emphasis. The separation between the communities are more evident in the right two visualizations with deemphasized lines. The silhouette of the temporal communities are less consistent in the visualization with completely deemphasized lines. Moderating the lines to deemphasize produces an intermediating visualization which accentuates the separation between communities while retaining the overall consistency in their silhouette.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Comparison with An Existing Technique</head><p>Currently, there is only one existing technique, presented by Ogawa and Ma, which is a greedy algorithm based on a set of layout heuristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The layout heuristics discussed in their work are mostly similar to the quality metrics discussed in this paper. In the study of Ogawa and Ma, the system visualized the clustering results of a dynamic social network of software developers using a weak component clustering algorithm, which mostly produced a singular supercluster. Consequently, we observed limited inter-cluster wiggles in their visualizations, which allowed the greedy algorithm-based technique to yield aesthetically pleasing visualizations. However, we found that when applied to a more complex dataset with multiple clusters, their greedy algorithm-based layout technique often fails to maintain the visual consistency in persistent communities. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 10</ref> shows a pair of storyline visualizations depicting communities from the start of WWII towards its end from the MID network dataset. One layout was generated with the open source software prepared by Ogawa <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. In order to focus on the differences in layout, other variables are held constant (i.e., the techniques for relaxing and deemphasizing lines are not applied in either visualization). In both visualizations, several communities and their temporal evolutions are portrayed by islands of bundled lines. One obvious difference between these visualizations is the one based on Ogawa and Ma's technique contains a significant amount of wiggly lines inside of the community islands, while most lines in our visualization maintain their orientations. We believe one of the main cause of this difference is the third design principle we present in Section 3 restricting lines from deviating unless of an event. Line wiggles were also considered in Ogawa and Ma's technique; however, they were only incorporated to the layout heuristics which loosely confined lines from wiggling.</p><p>Although these inner community line wiggles may be easily contained by adjusting the layout heuristics to employ the additional design principle, some features are less trivially resolvable using techniques based on greedy algorithms. For example, there are major structural changes among the communities during the time period highlighted by the yellow background. While Ogawa and Ma's technique provides a spatially efficient, compressed visual, individual lines become obscure due to the dense layout. On the other hand, our technique maintains visual consistency in persistent communities by taking advantage of the reserved spaces in which we believe that allows the viewers to observe the structural dynamics with improved clarity. Facilitating this visual consistency requires the layout algorithm to provide sufficient offset between communities prior to these structural changes in order to accommodate future community evolutions. Since greedy algorithms focus on optimizing local layout and do not take global trends into consideration, techniques based on such algorithms are inherently prone to generate visual clutter when there are major changes in community structures.</p><p>In addition to the structural dynamics in communities, maintaining the visual consistency of community islands also visually highlight patterns in the paths of individual lines. For example, in both visualizations, there is a purple line which frequently switches communities in the bottom left dimmed area. While this fluctuation can be seen in both visualizations, the movement becomes ambiguous in Ogawa and Ma's compressed environment. In contrast, the overall stability among the lines' orientations in our technique facilitates the delineation of the fluctuating lines from the rest of the visualization. Delineating such distinct patterns in social interactions allows viewers to instantly characterize and identify unique social entities which may be potential points of interest.</p><p>Although we believe that the visualization layout based on our technique achieves significant improvement over the clarity in conveying both collective and individual trends in social interactions, it comes with a considerable cost of computation time. This is all the more significant as the data complexity increases. While the time complexity of the layout algorithm based on Ogawa and Ma's technique is O(CT ), where C is the number of lines, and T is the number of time steps, our GA process scales at the rate of O(S I ), where S is the number of slots and I is the number of interaction sessions. In addition to the GA process, computing the layout for each genome also takes the time complexity of O(CI + ST I). Using a MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i7 processor, our technique took 37 hours to compute the presented layout for the MID dataset which consists of 191 lines, 677 time steps, 50 slots, and 432 interaction sessions, while Ogawa's code only took 10 minutes to compute the layout and render the whole image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Incorporating Spatial Information</head><p>In this study, we present an example of augmenting storyline visualizations by incorporating spatial information into the visualization. Visually encoding spatial information into storyline visualizations allows the visualization to portray not only when characters interact, but also where they interact providing additional context of the progression of the story. In addition to this augmentation, we also conduct a comparison between one of our visualizations with the hand-drawn illustration in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> to analyze the effectiveness of our technique in computing an elegant storyline visualization.</p><p>The datasets we use in this study are based on movies, Star Wars, The Matrix, and Inception. Each interaction session i i in these datasets contains an additional variable l i , which refers to the location where the interaction took place.</p><p>The adjustments we make to the evolutionary layout computation are simple. First, during preparation of the slots, we assign each location in the data to a set of neighboring slots. Second, we restrict the slots that an interaction session can occupy to the slots whose spatial location attribute is the same as the spatial location of the interaction session. Finally, the resulting space-coded slots are depicted in the background of the storyline visualization. <ref type="figure">Figure 11A</ref>, <ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref> show the augmented storyline visualizations of Star Wars, The Matrix, and Inception which each took 12, 9, and 20 minutes to generate. The color-coded contours indicate the locations of the characters. We use thin lines instead of tubelike lines for these visualizations following the designs of the XKCD's illustration. These augmented storyline visualizations provide a great overview of these movie plots and convey interesting concepts behind the world introduced in the movies.</p><p>The resemblance in layout between our visualization and the original hand-drawn illustration in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref> not only validates our design principles and the aesthetics in which our technique can achieve, but also implies that, although not explicitly mentioned, the original illustration had probably incorporated the characters' spatial information and other contextual information in its design. The overall line deviations and crossovers in our visualization (A) are 91 and 51, and in the original illustration (B) are 78 and 59. As a result, our visualization had about 16% increase in the number of deviations and 14% reduction in line crossings from the hand-drawn illustration. Therefore, we believe that although GA can only approximate the optimal solution, our technique can achieve high quality layouts and produce elegant storyline visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we present a set of design considerations for generating aesthetically pleasing and legible storyline visualizations. The layout based on our design principles and quality metrics show significant improvement over previous techniques in conveying both collective and individual social dynamics in data. The techniques for adjusting line geometry also provide options for enhancing the visualization's visual flow and clarity.</p><p>We also demonstrate the flexibility of our GA-based approach by augmenting storyline visualizations with additional information. The comparison between our visualization of Star Wars augmented by spatial and mobility information and the hand-drawn illustration shows that our technique can generate as good a storyline visualization as a professional illustrator. The visualizations of The Matrix and Inception augmented by spatial information not only provide viewers with the overview of their plots but also are able to reveal the complicated concepts behind the world introduced in the movies.</p><p>We believe this study shows the critical role of layout techniques for storyline visualizations, and the visualization's unexplored versatility. We expect our techniques to provide researchers with a framework for further exploring methods in augmenting storyline visualizations and for combining storyline visualizations with other visual analytics tools.</p><p>As future work, we would like to develop alternative methods for generating storyline visualizations with less computational cost and without compromising its aesthetics. We also intend to explore methods for applying storyline visualizations to realtime data streams. <ref type="figure">Fig. 11</ref>. Storyline visualizations of the movie Star Wars.
