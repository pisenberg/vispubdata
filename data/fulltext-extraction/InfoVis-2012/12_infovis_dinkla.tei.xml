<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>A network is a powerful abstraction that consists of elements and connections between these elements. Many common-day phenomena can be encoded as a network. People and their social contacts, for example, are summarized as social networks and subsequently studied in the scientific domain of sociology <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The bioinformatics domain makes heavy use of networks to make sense of interactions between organic compounds. However, large networks are hard to visualize. Standard network visualization methods, the node-link diagram and adjacency matrix, are popular due to their intuitive simplicity and their generic applicability (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>). However, they are unable to scale to complex networks, leading to the infamous hairballs in case of node-link diagrams. Recent developments in the field of network visualization move towards the exploitation of predetermined network characteris- tics in order to create visualizations that are more effective for analysis by domain experts. We present such an approach, which has been specifically designed for gene regulatory networks of bacteria. The gene regulatory network (GRN) of a bacterium describes interactions between a gene product (a regulator protein) and its target genes. Genes are specific pieces of DNA that form the blueprint for the creation of proteins. A regulator gene, a gene that codes for a regulator protein, can either promote (further) or inhibit (impede) other genes. Sometimes, a gene both inhibits and promotes, depending on environmental conditions. This regulation (or control) between genes is described by a GRN, where genes and regulations are represented as nodes and edges, respectively.</p><p>Because GRNs describe part of a bacterium's internal mechanics, domain experts study this type of network intensively, by making use of standard network visualization and layout methods. However, the specific structural properties of GRNs make visualization difficult, even when the network is small. This difficulty is caused by the following characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>:</p><p>Low in-degree Every gene is regulated by only a few other genes.</p><p>Therefore, all nodes of the network have a low in-degree.</p><p>Scale-free out-degree There are few genes that regulate many others, and many genes that regulate few others. Therefore, the network's out-degree distribution follows a power law.</p><p>Few cycles The network has few cycles because genes rarely (indirectly) regulate each other both ways.  In this paper, we propose an approach that exploits these structural characteristics, by creating an adjacency matrix that is cut up and rearranged to take up less space. Our novel network depiction benefits bacterial GRN analysis, and has the following properties:</p><p>Compactness This enables a detailed overview of the entire network.</p><p>Localization of motifs This enables quick detection of subnetworks of interest.</p><p>Consistent arrangement This facilitates interaction while preserving visual orientation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Much research in the area of network visualization has been performed <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42]</ref>. In this section, we restrict our overview to related work directly relevant to our proposed approach. The node-link diagram and adjacency matrix are the most popular for network visualization. Node-link diagrams are-in general-used to depict sparse networks (with a low edge to node ratio), while adjacency matrices are an alternative for dense networks (with a high edge to node ratio) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Node-link diagrams are intuitive, and most people are able to interpret such diagrams without receiving further explanation. Therefore, network visualization tools in the biological domain often use this representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43]</ref>. However, when a network is dense, this intuitiveness is overshadowed by the visual clutter caused by the many edges that have to be drawn. In this case, an adjacency matrix provides a more ordered and therefore easier to interpret depiction, even though an observer will have to become accustomed to the visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41]</ref>.</p><p>Optimal drawing of node-link diagrams, corresponding to aesthetic criteria, and the combinatorial aspects of deriving diagrams that adhere to these criteria, is the focus of the Graph Drawing domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Eades was the first to propose a force simulation to lay out graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, after which more elaborate force models were developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Such force-based layouts are simple and effective. Aesthetic criteria are often used to judge the effectiveness of node-link diagrams and to derive algorithms that generate high-quality diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The number of intersections in a diagram is an important criterion, and therefore many techniques focus on reducing these intersections <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>. Giving edges a more complex geometry than a straight line, enabling the routing of edges, is a way to avoid intersections as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>A simple example of the exploitation of specific network characteristics is that of tree-layout algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Such algorithms generate layouts that emphasize the inherent tree structure. Similarly, DAGs (short for Directed Acyclic Graphs) are given special treatment with Sugiyama's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>, where the layered structure of a DAG is exploited and emphasized.</p><p>The layout of an adjacency matrix is fairly rigid, i.e., nodes and edges are restricted to rows and columns. Most attention has been given to ordering nodes in such a way that patterns in the network structure become apparent. This is known as rearrangement clustering, where nodes are placed close to each other in the arrangement when their distance, according to some similarity measure, is small as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Such approaches take on more complex forms in biclustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, which tries to optimize horizontal and vertical ordering of nodes simultaneously. The use of adjacency matrices and corresponding rearrangement techniques is popular in the biological domain, where they appear in the form of heat maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Combining node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices has been explored as well. One way of doing this is to couple a node-link diagram and an adjacency matrix depiction of the same network by coordinated views <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Another way is to create a true hybrid, like the NodeTrix technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, where dense parts of a network are detected, isolated, and visualized as matrices, which are then reconnected with links that represent the sparse sections of the network. This is another example of a technique that exploits structural characteristics, namely the presence of dense clusters.</p><p>An adjacency matrix can also be used when a network forms a DAG. Then, when nodes are ordered to respect the DAG layers, only the top-right triangle of the matrix will contain edge depictions. If the DAG has few edges that skip multiple layers, the resulting matrix can be arranged to form a more space-efficient staircase-like depiction. This property is effectively used in Quilts <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, by giving special treatment to the layer skipping edges, turning them into nodes referenced with color codes, which enables further compaction of the adjacency matrix. Genea Quilts <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> are a variant of Quilts that exploit properties specific to genealogical networks to achieve similar compression.</p><p>Many analysis tasks involve following a path along the edges of a network. In node-link diagrams, edges can be traced easily from node to node, provided they are not overly obfuscated by intersections with other edges. Node duplication involves the placement of multiple copies of the same node, and distributing the edges over these duplicates <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. This enables greater reduction of edge crossings, creating a cleaner depiction, at the cost of paths becoming harder to trace over the nodes that have been duplicated. This problem also occurs in adjacency matrices, because every node is represented horizontally as well as vertically, for outbound and inbound edges, respectively. Therefore, following a path in an adjacency matrix is notoriously hard <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>In a biological setting, node duplication is often used for node-link diagrams of metabolic networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, where certain nodes have such a high degree that they are either split into many duplicate representations or removed altogether. This is done because some compounds, like water, are involved in so many metabolic processes that they do <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. Node-link diagram of the same GRN as in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. Generated with Cytoscape <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, using a standard spring-embedder layout algorithm. Genes are depicted as dark gray nodes and regulations as colored links: green, red, orange, and blue for promotion, inhibition, both, and unspecified, respectively. not represent information of particular interest to an analyst. The tasks that an analyst has to perform, aided by a network visualization, is of great influence to such trade-offs. In some cases, tracing paths is of no concern and representations more akin to adjacency lists are used, such as animal pedigrees <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Here, paths are hard to follow, but it is much easier to compare two nodes (and their attributes) that share an edge. Dealing with the richness of information attached to nodes and edges of networks often leads to these kind of solutions in visual analytics. Pathline is another example of this <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, where metabolic pathways are shaped into a vertical linear ordering, making it harder to interpret the pathway, but easier to compare corresponding timeseries data that can now be stacked on top of each other in a consistent manner.</p><p>Any network visualization is prone to scalability issues. Large graph layout algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> often result in visualizations that are difficult to interpret. In such circumstances, compression of the network, either lossless or lossy, can be beneficial. Here, lossless compression refers to a visualization that still encodes all network information, but with more complex encoding schemes that require additional effort by an analyst to interpret. For example, visually nesting nodes with edges identical to other nodes (identical neighborhoods) in a joint node can drastically reduce the number of edges that have to be drawn. However, the routing of edges to nested nodes makes the structure of nested nodes more complex. Grouping together children of trees is a simple version of this <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and an extension of this encoding to multiple levels of nesting has been applied for the analysis of protein interaction networks, forming so-called Power Graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Lossy compression is usually done by clustering of nodes into meta-nodes, thereby also collapsing edges into meta-edges, where the presence of individual nodes and edges may be lost in the visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. These kind of approaches are used in interactive settings, where meta-nodes may be expanded and collapsed at will <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">MOTIVATION AND CONCEPT</head><p>Node-link diagrams are the customary method of inspecting gene regulatory networks in the biological domain, see <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> for an example. Global features of the network are visible in the diagram, such as the strong interconnectedness of the network, few genes that regulate many other genes, and many genes that are regulated by few genes. More detailed features, such as the immediate neighborhood of a gene, are obfuscated by many links causing substantial overlaps. Yet, context and details are both important to biologists: they require a clear overview of the immediate neighborhood of a gene, but also need to follow paths and determine indirect regulations. Our aim is to facilitate both in the same visualization.</p><p>As an alternative visualization, it would be possible to use an adjacency matrix. However, as is clear from <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>, the network contains many nodes but relatively few edges: it is sparse. The resulting adjacency matrix would therefore take up a lot of display space (approximately 700 by 700 rows and columns, respectively), but it would be mostly empty. This makes it hard to see both network context and details at the same time. The specific characteristics of a GRN-low indegree, power law out-degree, and few and small cycles [2]-however, allow us to introduce a variant of an adjacency matrix that we call a Compressed Adjacency Matrix (CAM).</p><p>The first two characteristics can be seen clearly in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. It is important to note that they cause a strong interconnectedness of the network, which makes it difficult to interpret a node-link representation. However, in combination with the third characteristic, they imply that a GRN has a highly DAG-like structure that consists of few layers. Moreover, because of the second characteristic, there are relatively few roots, nodes with no inbound edges; few hubs, nodes with both inbound and outbound edges; and many leaves, nodes with no outbound edges. This is essential to the construction of our CAM, and they are crucial to obtain its regular structure (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>).</p><p>The interpretation of a CAM is straightforward, but, like a standard adjacency matrix, a CAM is somewhat less intuitive than a node-link diagram. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>(c) illustrates how to read a CAM: The outbound and inbound edges of a node are found by looking to the right and upwards, respectively, while using the underlying thick lines as guides.</p><p>From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>, several beneficial properties of CAMs become apparent. First, the entire neighborhood of a node is easy to find by following its underlying line. Second, nodes with identical neighborhoods are localized as stacks that save space (lossless compression). Third, the few and small cycles in the network are localized and give the impression of an actual cycle, due to the edges of the cycles being drawn as arcs. Fourth, the layers of the network's DAG-like structure, and regulations between these layers, are compartmentalized and visible as contiguous surfaces. Finally, paths can be followed by tracing the underlying thick lines through nodes, which is usually easy in nodelink diagrams as well, but not in standard adjacency matrices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">APPROACH</head><p>Though CAMs have a tidy appearance and standard adjacency matrices are easy to derive from CAMs, the conversion of a network to a CAM is not trivial and consists of six steps. First, the network is decomposed into weakly connected components, after which every component is treated as a separate network for the remaining steps. Second, nodes with identical neighborhoods are grouped. Third, strongly connected components are detected and grouped to form a DAG. Fourth, the nodes of the DAG are partitioned into layers such that all edges have the same direction with respect to the layers. Fifth, the lay- ers are turned into blocks that form the backbone of the CAM, where nodes are partitioned into five classes that dictate their arrangement in the CAM. In addition, grouped strongly connected components are split into separate nodes again while maintaining the vertex arrangement dictated by the blocks. Finally, the blocks are concatenated to form a cascade from which node positions and the CAM visualization are derived in various styles. We describe each step in detail and illustrate it with a running example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Network</head><p>The network is a directed graph G = (V, E), where V is the set of vertices (nodes) and E is the set of directed edges between vertices of G. We assume that G is weakly connected, i.e., every vertex is reachable from any other vertex when edge directions are ignored. If a network is not weakly connected, it is decomposed into weakly connected components with a connectivity search. Each weakly connected component is then taken as G and converted to a CAM (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>). The individual CAMs are concatenated in the final visualization. The vertices in our network have a number of attributes, such as the gene's name and annotation of gene function. The edges have a single attribute that describes the type of interaction between a gene and its target, namely promotion, inhibition, both, and unspecified. However, the exact nature of the attributes is irrelevant to the construction of a CAM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Identical neighborhood grouping</head><p>Biological networks contain a lot of vertices with an identical neighborhood. Grouping these vertices reduces the complexity of the network, while still leaving open the possibility to properly convey each vertex of a group in the final visualization. To this end, we define a grouped version G I = (V I , E I ) of G, where V I is the set of vertices of G I that represent non-overlapping subsets of V with identical neighborhoods, and E I is the set of directed edges of G I .</p><p>Here, it is important to note that we take the edge attribute (describing the type of regulation) into account: only edges with the same value for the attribute are combined into one. An example is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>, in which the vertices e and f both receive input from vertices b and c, thus their neighborhoods are considered identical. Such vertices are stacked on top of each other in the final visualization, cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>(b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Strongly connected component grouping</head><p>We need to remove all cycles of G I to turn it into a Directed Acyclic Graph. Along the same lines of the Sugiyama algorithm [40], we could temporarily invert those edges that break a cycle, to be reverted again  in the final visualization with a special edge depiction. However, a better alternative is available to us because we know that G and therefore G I has few and small cycles. The small cycles imply the existence of small strongly connected components (SCC), i.e., sub-graphs where any vertex is reachable from any other vertex. The SCCs of G I are a partition of V I . By grouping every SCC into a single vertex, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 7</ref>, we create a DAG G S = (V S , E S ). The set of vertices V S represents SCCs of G I , and the set E S is the set of directed edges between vertices in G S . The edges E S are not necessarily the same as the edges E I . They represent an aggregation, which means that edges of E I with different attribute values can be represented by a single edge of E S . This is not important for the construction of the CAM, because it relies only on the structure of G S .</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L 0 L 1 L 2 L 3 a,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Layers</head><p>Graph G S is a DAG and can therefore be regarded as a layered structure (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 8</ref>). We determine its layers L i , i = 0, 1, . . . , m, which form a partition of V S , in a similar way as Sugiyama's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>:</p><p>The edges that run between layers all have the same direction. Also, no edge runs between two vertices of the same layer. The vertex configuration is as compact as possible: if a vertex v ∈ L i has outbound edges, then there exists v ′ ∈ L i+1 and an edge from v to v ′ , or there exists v ′ ∈ L i−1 and an edge from v ′ to v. In other words, vertices immediately precede their successors in the DAG if there are any successors, or immediately succeed their predecessors otherwise. This is important for the derivation of blocks from layers in a later stage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Blocks</head><p>The layered node-link diagram of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 8</ref> already conveys the structure of the network quite well. However, for large networks, the many edge intersections between layers make it hard to interpret. We therefore transform the layers into blocks, which we arrange in such a way that empty space can be used effectively to obtain a compact visualization.</p><p>Layers map directly to blocks, i.e., a block B i is derived from its corresponding layer L i . Block B i consists of sequences of vertices, H i and V i , that specify the horizontal and vertical ordering of L i 's vertices in the CAM, respectively. An appropriate ordering of the vertices in H i and V i is crucial to obtain the desired compactness. We achieve this by partitioning the vertices of L i into five classes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Leaf Vertex in L i without successors.</formula><p>Short root Vertex in L i that has a successor but no predecessors and all successors are leaves in L i+1 . </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">V i Fig. 9.</formula><p>The composition of B i and its placement with respect to its neighboring blocks.</p><p>Long root Vertex in L i that has a successor but no predecessors and is not a short root.</p><p>Short hub Vertex in L i that has a predecessor and successor, and all successors are leaves in L i+1 .</p><p>Long hub Vertex in L i that has a predecessor and successor, but is not a short hub.</p><p>The partition that we get for L i then consists of leaves P L , short roots P SR , long roots P LR , short hubs P SH , and long hubs P LH . Each of these sets can be ordered individually, based on attributes or some other characteristic. This ordering affects the readability of the CAM, and we will come back to this in Section 4.6. Once we have the partition, we can construct H i and V i by concatenation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">H i = [P L , P SR , P SH , P LH , P LR ] V i = [P SR , P SH , P LH , P LR ]</formula><p>The construction of H i and V i allows us to make a spatial configuration of B i as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. The blocks B 1 , B 2 , ..., B m form a cascade with enough space above it for edge depictions (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 10(b)</ref>). Most vertices of L i occur twice in this configuration. The vertices of H i have depictions above them to represent inbound edges from predecessors (in the light gray zone). Similarly, vertices in V i have depictions to their right to represent outbound edges to successors. This explains why P L is missing from V i : it consists of leaves that have no outbound edges. The presence of P SR in H i is optional. Removing it will result in a more compact but less consistent CAM, which we will discuss in Section 4.6. Likewise, the configuration of B i−1 and B i is made more compact by shifting down P L . This is possible, because vertices of P SR and P SH in B i−1 have only outbound edges to P L of B i . Therefore, no space is required for edge depictions beyond P L .</p><p>From the arrangement that we now have, we can actually construct a standard adjacency matrix, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 10(c)</ref>. This can be done by shifting the vertices that belong to some H i upwards to a common horizontal axis, and shifting those vertices that belong to some V i to a vertical axis at the left (while respecting their block-induced arrangement).</p><p>Finally, the grouped strongly connected components V S are flattened within H i and V i . The sets of identical neighborhood vertices are maintained in the layout, and drawn as stacks of vertices. In addition, edges in E I that connect vertices of a strongly connected component are represented by arcs, which forms the cycle shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>.</p><p>For the small example network, clearly not much compression can be achieved. However, the teaser image and the image discussed in Section 5 show that our approach is effective for compressing large GRNs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Visualization</head><p>Our approach creates a layout that consists of inbound and/or outbound positions for every vertex if it has an in and/or outbound neighborhood, respectively. This provides us with enough information to create a CAM visualization. As in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 10</ref>, edge depictions are placed in a grid, outbound from the vertex to its direct left and inbound to the vertex directly below it. We give a special treatment to hubs because they have inbound and outbound edges by definition. In standard adjacency matrices, they therefore appear both at the left and at the top of the matrix, spaced wide apart, making it difficult to trace a path. In contrast, we place each hub at the middle of an arc that extends from the hub's inbound neighborhood to its outbound neighborhood. This special treatment of hubs is enabled by their carefully chosen arrangement (cf. <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">L 0 L 1 L 2 L 3 a,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Styles</head><p>Like for a standard adjacency matrix, the grid drawn in the background is a visual aid that more strongly associates a vertex depiction with edge depictions of its in-and/or outbound neighborhoods (and viceversa). Even with this aid, adjacency matrices are hard to interpret when they are large. We have therefore experimented with various visual styles to improve interpretation. A sample of style combinations is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 11</ref>.</p><p>The first style is a plain grid, where grid cells are separated by solid lines (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 11(a)</ref>). These lines help to inspect the neighborhood of a vertex, but they have to be given a dark color to be visible due to their small width. This creates many strong brightness transitions in the visualization, impeding its aesthetics. The second style circumvents the need for explicit lines by introducing gray edge depictions for those vertex pairs that have no edges between them (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 11(b)</ref>). This generalization creates a grid pattern that guides the observer as well. However, the presence of these non-edge depictions draws away attention from the actual edges, making it harder to get an impression of the network's connectivity. Moreover, a connection between the neighborhoods of hubs still has to be made explicit, which is done with a thick arc that does not integrate well with the visual style of the rest of the CAM.</p><p>In our opinion, the third style is the most effective and therefore default style of the prototype. Instead of drawing lines between the edge depictions, thick and translucent lines are drawn behind them (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 11(c)</ref>). Vertical and horizontal lines appear darker where they intersect due to their translucency, as though they are plies that are stacked on top of each other. This makes every line of a vertex stand out and better to trace, e.g., it is easy to follow a line down from an edge, along an arc, to the depiction of the hub that the edge is directed to, and even further along the arc, into the hub's outbound neighborhood. Thus, paths in the network are visually apparent and can be followed. Note that this is not possible in a standard adjacency matrix. The other styles also enable path following, but the neighborhood of a vertex does not appear as a clear contiguous area.</p><p>Even with the aid of a grid, it is still hard to find all edges of a vertex's neighborhood because it is easy to accidentally skip a line over a long distance. This is similar to drifting off direction when there are no lines guiding you. One way to suppress this effect is to add more structure to the grid, providing additional landmarks to guide an observer. A periodic change of grid cell color is commonly used to get this effect in adjacency matrices and tables. However, we want to restrict the use of colors, because we already use colors to encode edge types. Instead, extra space can be added between vertices to create a visual grouping of cells. This makes skipping a line harder, but also causes the visualization to be less tidy (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 11(d)</ref>). Likewise, space between blocks and different classes of vertex can be added if desired.</p><p>We have also experimented with minimizing line length while making sure the lines still contain all edges (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 11(f)</ref>). This makes it easier to determine the extent of a neighborhood. It also makes the visualization less structured, and implies the presence of edges (possibly non-existing) at line intersections, because the immediate neighborhood is darker. Similarly, the inbound neighborhood line of a root is hidden by default because it wastes space (it has no edges to guide the observer to). Including these lines may be desirable, however, to get a more consistent visualization (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 11(g)</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Color</head><p>All visual components of the CAM are gray scale except for the edges. The number of grays used is kept at a minimum, because this draws attention to the edges. This also leaves the rest of the color space available to color code edge types such that they are easy to distinguish. Green and red colors encode regulations that promote and inhibit, respectively, because it is a custom in the target domain. Orange encodes regulations that both promote and inhibit, because it is approximately an intermediary for green and red, yet can still be distinguished as a separate color. Blue encodes unspecified regulations, because it has a neutral connotation.</p><p>Vertices are colored dark gray-not black-to make them less dominant. They are also given halos matching the background color (white) to improve contrast, and to make them distinguishable when partially stacked. Likewise, edges and text labels are given halos.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Various vertex arrangements are implemented in the prototype, i.e., the sets in the partition of a layer L i (cf. Section 4.5) can be ordered in various ways. Simple arrangements like sorting by in-and out-degree are possible, in addition to rearrangement clustering by neighborhood similarity. Similarity clustering is widely used to bring out edge patterns in standard adjacency matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and by comparison of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 11(c)</ref> and (e) it is also beneficial to CAMs of GRNs. The use of arrangements is configurable in the prototype, but by default we arrange leaves by inbound neighborhood similarity, and hubs and roots by out-degree. Switching arrangements can be done interactively, where vertices transition smoothly to their new positions.</p><p>Vertex arrangement in CAMs is more restricted than in an adjacency matrix due to vertices being part of blocks and their partitions. It is also possible that leaves with similar neighborhoods end up in different layers of the DAG and thus in a different block because one inbound edge is different, causing a large distance between the leaves in the final visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interaction</head><p>Hovering over vertices and edges is possible for highlighting and obtaining additional information, i.e., gene name and function descrip-tion for hovered vertices, and inbound and outbound gene names for hovered edges. In addition, two types of connectivity search are supported: highlighting of direct neighborhood and highlighting of the entire up-and down-directed section of the network, i.e., all genes that (in-)directly influence or are influenced by the hovered gene (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 11(h)</ref>). Moreover, multiple vertices can be selected such that any highlighting is kept in place when the vertices are no longer being hovered.</p><p>When a vertex or edge is highlighted, its size, color saturation, and brightness is increased, such that it stands out from its surroundings. The background grid lines are darkened as well to provide extra guidance. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 11(h)</ref>, the enlarged edges also help to distinguish between those edges that are part of the connectivity search, and those that are part of the neighborhood of a connected vertex.</p><p>Highlighted vertices and edges attract attention, but the remainder of the network may inhibit their inspection. The prototype therefore allows to filter those vertices and edges that are not highlighted. This causes a considerable reduction in size of the CAM, making it easier to interpret (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 11(h)</ref>). Moreover, it enables interactive navigation of the network, because nodes can be added or removed from the selection, increasing or decreasing parts of the network that are highlighted and therefore visible. To better facilitate this navigation, the transition between filtered CAMs is animated, and the underlying block arrangement is maintained to preserve the observer's visual orientation. This means that the entire network is always the basis for the generated CAM, so the DAG structure that leads to layers and blocks is stable, and vertices do not switch blocks, regardless of filtering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>We will now compare CAMs to standard visualization techniques that are often used for GRN analysis. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 12 and 13</ref> show the CAM and the node-link diagram of a GRN of the bacterium Escherichia coli, which consists of approximately 1300 genes and 2800 regulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>Node-link diagrams are more intuitive than CAMs, but in case of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 13</ref>, there are so many edge intersections that the diagram is hardly readable. Some depictions are even fully occluded, leading to a loss of information. More advanced node-link encodings <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, or layout techniques that are specific to scale-free networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, may create more insightful visualizations. However, many edge intersections cannot be avoided due to the interconnectedness of the GRN. Edge-bundling techniques could alleviate this further <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, but at the risk of additional information loss.</p><p>The main disadvantage of CAMs is inefficient use of space. Nodelink diagrams can be more efficient in this aspect, because the positioning of nodes is less restricted. Even after compression, it can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 12</ref> that large sections of the CAM remain unused, and that it has a high aspect ratio. However, the neatly-arranged visualization and lack of edge overlaps provided by a CAM outweigh these disadvantages.</p><p>GRN analysts have specific needs that have to be taken into account as well, which involve the search of patterns. These patterns come in the form of subnetworks with a specific structure. Some instances of these subnetworks are called motifs, which are subnetworks that are statistically over-represented in GRNs, and are known to have a specialized function <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. We therefore consider the most important subnetwork structures, corresponding motifs, and related generic network tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Genes should be regarded as part of a dynamical system to understand why specific subnetwork structures have specialized function. Genes have a so-called level of expression that is conceptually related to the extent at which the gene is involved in protein production or the regulation of other genes. It is also possible to talk about regulation signals, because regulations are dependent on gene expression levels  and are therefore time dependent. The motifs that we discuss can thus be regarded as signal processing components, acting as signal delays, filters, and pulse generators.</p><p>Self-edge Single vertex with an edge directed to itself.</p><p>This structure is of particular interest in GRNs because a selfinhibiting gene (or the negative auto-regulation motif) likely shows a faster response to inbound regulation signals, and is more stable when receiving fluctuating signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Likewise, a self-promoting gene (or the positive auto-regulation motif) shows slower response to inbound signals. Self-edges are easily spotted in both <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 12</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 13</ref> as curves that bend back into a node. This also makes self-edges localized such that they are easily spotted as a part of another subnetwork of interest.</p><p>Out-fan Vertex with edges directed towards a set of vertices.</p><p>Inspecting an out-fan of a vertex requires finding its neighborhood, the adjacency task of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. This is relevant for gaining insight about regulators, which are genes with a large outbound neighborhood, referred to as a regulon. These regulators play a dominant role in a bacterium's response to environmental conditions, acting as master switches for parts of a GRN. A regulator is easily spotted in a node-link diagram by the many edges that converge at its position, creating the appearance of an actual fan. Likewise, a regulator is easily spotted in a CAM because it is either a root or a hub, and these vertex classes are easily distinguished. A regulator also tends to be in a higher layer and has large strips of edge depictions to its right that is emphasized by neighborhood similarity clustering. In addition, the ordering of hubs and roots by out-degree places regulons close to each other per layer, making them easier to spot. Surveying the entire neighborhood of a regulon, however, is difficult in node-link diagrams because direct neighbors can be positioned anywhere, and individual edges are hard to spot because of the many edge intersections. While neighbors have more regular positions in a CAM, making them easier to find, they can be spread out over longer distances as well. The single-input module motif is a form of out-fan where the genes of a regulon are affected by only one regulator (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 14)</ref>. Here, a temporal arrangement of gene activations occurs by varying the regulation strength to each gene of the regulon, in essence creating a sequential program that is executed when the regulator becomes active. Single-input modules are spotted in a node-link diagram by their dense arrangement around a regulator, provided that it is not obfuscated by edges that are not part of the module. Stacked leaves in a CAM, with only one inbound edge, correspond directly to a single-input module. For example, it can be seen that Escherichia coli has many such modules of varying size spread out over all layers, while Bacillus subtilis (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>) has relatively few large modules that are mostly part of the first layers.</p><p>In-fan Vertex with edges directed towards it from a set of vertices.</p><p>The observations for the out-fan are symmetric to those of the in-fan. However, the in-fan is of relevance to the multiple-input module motif, which is an extension of the single-input module where multiple regulons have strong overlap (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 14)</ref>. This enables the execution of different sequential programs with the same genes. The special arrangement of vertices in CAMs clearly reveal multiple-input modules, where the out-degree ordering of roots and hubs pushes regulators close together and the neighborhood similarity arrangement of leaves show overlap-and differences-between regulons as thick stripes of edge depictions. Regulon overlap can be detected in node-link diagrams as two fans that diverge to the same set of nodes if only two regulators are involved. However, involvement of more than two regulators results in patterns that are hard to discern. Moreover, it is harder to compare two or more regulons in the node-link diagram of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 13</ref> than in the CAM of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 12</ref>.</p><p>Path Multiple vertices connected such that they form a directed chain.</p><p>A path in a GRN is effectively an indirect regulation of the gene at the end of the path by the gene at the beginning of the path. Likewise, a regulator may have greater effect on the entire GRN than initially estimated from its regulon, because it affects even more genes via paths through its regulon. This stipulates the desire for focus (e.g., fans) and context (e.g., paths). Tracing a path is called follow path in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>There may exist multiple paths between two genes. Such regulatory paths tend to pass signals at different speeds, especially when the lengths of the paths are unequal. The relevance of this follows from feed-forward loop motifs. Feed-forward loops consist of three genes with one direct and one indirect regulation (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 14)</ref>. Its behaviors are the filtering of pulses (brief inbound regulation signals), the conversion of long inbound regulation signals to outbound pulses, and the shortening or elongation of response to inbound signals similar to auto-regulation.</p><p>Following paths is already difficult in the node-link diagrams of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 3 and 13</ref>, and spotting two paths between two nodes even more so. This is not easy in CAMs either, but feed-forward loops can still be discerned because the nodes of the paths follow each other in the layering and therefore create consistent patterns. These patterns are made explicit by highlighting and filtering, as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 11(h)</ref>.</p><p>Cycle Multiple vertices connected such that they form a cycle.</p><p>Cycles are also known as feed-back loops but they are uncommon in GRNs, and therefore not considered to be motifs. However, genes that are part of cycles have strongly associated behavior, because these cycles tend to be small. For example, two genes that inhibit each other form a cycle that functions as a form of indirect auto-regulation on both genes. In that sense, genes that are part of a cycle behave in unison.</p><p>The presence of cycles is clearly lost in large node-link diagrams, where the nodes of a cycle can have large distance between them, and the links of the cycles are obfuscated by other links. Cycles are localized in CAMs and have the appearance of actual cycles, making them easier to spot. Moreover, the complementary nature of genes that are part of a cycle also becomes apparent, because their neighborhood edges are placed close to each other in the matrix. This enables easy comparison of their neighborhoods (see the right-most cycle in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 12)</ref>.</p><p>Clearly, there are other visualization techniques beyond node-link diagrams that can be considered, foremost of which are adjacency matrices and more advanced visual encodings. Adjacency matrices, however, are almost identical to CAMs but take up a lot more space and do not facilitate following a path. The more advanced visual encodings focus on networks that have structural characteristics different from those of GRNs. NodeTrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, for example, is effective for networks that have somewhat isolated clusters, which does not match the strongly interconnected nature of GRNs that follows from their scalefree out-degree distribution. Moreover, Quilts <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> are designed for DAG-like networks but rely on a tidy layer structure where few edges skip layers. As becomes clear from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 12</ref>, GRNs have many edges that skip layers, mainly outbound from important regulators, that make Quilts impractical. We have also tried other node-link layout algorithms, but these gave the same, or worse, results as the one shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 13</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>We have presented a new approach for the visualization of GRNs and demonstrated its strengths and weaknesses with respect to finding subnetwork structures that are of importance to GRN analysts. Moreover, CAMs have clear benefits over standard adjacency matrices, such as the ability to follow paths, which in some aspects is even easier than in node-link diagrams. The feasibility of applying the CAM technique in practice is shown with a prototype that supports various interactive techniques often used for standard adjacency matrices. The combination of adjacency matrix specific techniques, such as rearrangement clustering, and node-link diagram properties, such as no node duplication, make for a good alternative to current GRN visualizations.</p><p>Future work includes the integration of CAMs into the visual analysis process of GRN analysts. This involves the mapping of additional data to vertices, such as gene expression time series, where we can exploit the linear arrangement of vertices in a CAM to improve attribute comparison tasks. We also want to investigate further matrix compression, for example, by arranging leaves by neighborhood size and pushing sections of them upwards where possible. In addition, the layers of a CAM could be made to branch out, in accordance with a possible branch-like structure of the network itself.</p><p>For a CAM to achieve an extensive compression, the visualized network has to fulfill specific requirements. So far we have not encountered other types of network that fulfill these requirements. However, we plan to investigate methods to make CAMs applicable to a broader class of networks. Case in point is an alternate method to deal with cycles, i.e., inverting edges instead of grouping strongly connected components. This means that the few and small cycles requirement can be dropped, but likely at the cost of less intuitive visualizations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Two widely-used visualization techniques.
