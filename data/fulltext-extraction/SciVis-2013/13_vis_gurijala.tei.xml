Optical colonoscopy (OC), whereby precancerous polyps (protrusions/bumps on the colon wall) can be located and removed, has been recommended for screening and has greatly reduced the mortality from colorectal cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Virtual colonoscopy (VC) has been developed as viable non-invasive alternative to OC for screening purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. VC is a non-invasive screening method, whereby a radiologist can explore a colon surface in a way similar to that of a gastroenterologist performing an OC. The radiologist is mainly interested in visualizing the inner surface of the colon where polyps might be detected. VC uses computed tomographic (CT) scan of a patient's abdomen and provides a virtual fly-through visualization system through the virtual colon reconstructed from the CT scan <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>• Krishna Chaitanya Gurijala, Stony Brook University.

However, VC has a fundamental problem, which it shares with OC. Due to the twisted nature of the colon and the numerous colonic haustral folds, the navigation using the inner endoluminal view is very challenging and sizable sections of the colon are not inspected, resulting in an incomplete examination. As a result, polyps hidden behind folds and sharp bends are missed. An efficient supplemental approach is flattening, where the colon is cut open and flattened onto a 2D plane. This not only facilitates comprehensive inspection of the colon but also reduces the time for inspection. Several flattening techniques have been proposed for the colon surface, whereby the entire colon can be mapped from the 3D domain to a 2D rectangular domain. The colon mesh surface serves as the input. This mesh surface is extracted from the CT images by performing electronic cleaning, segmentation, and mesh extraction. However, the major problem here is that the extracted colon surface includes topological noise, such as handles, as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1(a)</ref>. A close-up view of a handle is also shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1(a)</ref>. This topological noise is due to two reasons. The first is due to artifacts present in the CT scan. The second is due to the colon surface reconstruction method. Although many surface reconstruction methods are capable of generating watertight surfaces from the CT data, the resulting models may still exhibit topological errors in the form of small handles. These high-frequency topological features unnecessarily increase the complexity of the colon model and make it unsuitable for subsequent processing tasks, such as colon flattening, 3D navigation, and polyp detection. Hence, in all previous methods for colon flattening, these unnecessary noisy features were either removed manually or by some topological denoising techniques. However, owing to the large surface of the colon, the use of these denoising methods is time-consuming and incurs high computational overhead.</p><p>In order to address this problem, we have introduced a new colon flattening algorithm using the heat diffusion metric, which is efficient, robust (insensitive to any topological noise) and shape-preserving. In our method, we use the extracted colon mesh directly without performing any topological denoising. To start, we compute the heat diffusion distances (HDDs) for the entire colon mesh (with noise). This HDD is used as a metric for the flattening. We compute this metric for an appropriate time step and replace the original Euclidean metric of the colon surface with this new metric. In the next step, we solve a Laplacian equation on the colon surface to obtain a harmonic form. By applying the Hodge star operator on this harmonic form, we obtain another form that is perpendicular to the harmonic form. Finally, we integrate these two metric forms on the colon surface to obtain the flattened colon. We render the flattened colon image using direct volume rendering to provide a view similar to that of the endoluminal view, as can be seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1(b)</ref>. We demonstrate how the existing colon registration pipeline is turned more robust by using our method for colon flattening. Furthermore, we show that our method enhances the colon navigation by preserving the important features, such as the polyps and folds. In addition, we also present an efficient handle detection and removal approach on the flattened colon using our method.</p><p>Our method has the following advantages: 1. Robustness: Our method of using the heat diffusion metric for flattening is insensitive to topological noise, such as fake handles. As a result, by using our algorithm, the entire global shape is preserved after flattening in spite of having many handles. On the contrary, other methods, such as the Ricci flow, produce a highly distorted flattening result of the colon in the presence of noise. 2. Efficiency: Our method is very efficient since we need to solve only one Laplacian equation for the entire colon surface. On the other hand, other methods, such as the holomorphic 1-form <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, require solving of 2g Poisson equations, where g is the number of handles on the colon surface. In case of a large number of handles (which is typical), our method performs far better than the other methods. 3. Shape preserving: Our method is shape preserving. Even under the constraint of preserving the global shape, the local shape distortion is still under control. The final result obtained by using our method on a colon surface with noise is very similar to the one obtained by using other conformal based methods on the same colon surface with noise removed. Therefore, our method exhibits a good trade off between conformality and robustness.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature and Section 3 provides the necessary theoretical background. The algorithm and its analysis is provided in Section 4. Section 5 compares our method with other well-known methods. Section 6 introduces a fast way to remove the handles on the flattened colon. Section 7 contains implementation and experimental results. Section 8 demonstrates the application of our colon flattening to polyp visualization and supine-prone colon registration. Section 9 contains concluding remarks and future work summary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Colon flattening is a method in which the entire inner surface of the colon is displayed as a succinct 2D image and has been used successfully for several medical imaging applications. Initial attempts to flatten the colon surface include iterative methods based on electrical field lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>, cartographic projection <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and some others <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. However, most of these methods deform the colon surface or do not preserve the local shapes well. Conformal geometry, an approach where the local angles are preserved, has been well established in the field of computer graphics, especially in the creation of texture maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Discrete Ricci flow is a more recent method of computing conformal maps of structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and is very useful in the construction of geometric structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and to obtain optimal surface parameterizations using inverse curvature maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Colon flattening techniques have been proposed using conformal mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and holomorphic 1-form parameterization <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The conformally flattened colon was used in the detection of colonic polyps <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and supineprone colon registration <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Further, surface parameterization using harmonic functions has also been used in graphics <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and medical imaging of the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and blood vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</p><p>All the above methods require a mandatory pre-process of topological denoising because of the topological noise (fake handles), without which the flattening would be unsuccessful. While some of these methods use colon surfaces that have been manually denoised, the others utilize a topological denoising algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. A fast topological denoising algorithm for conformal colon flattening has also been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Despite these attempts, topological denoising is still a time consuming and tedious process. On the other hand, our method does not require any topological denoising, as the heat diffusion metric utilized by our method is insensitive to topological noise. In addition, we propose an efficient way to detect and remove the handles on the flattened colon surface by using our approach.</p><p>Topologically robust diffusion geometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> has been mainly used for analysis of non-rigid shapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref> involving shape comparison, matching, and retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. The robust diffusion maps and diffusion distances <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> have been proposed for shape matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, histogram comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and comparison of flexible molecular shapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. However, it has never been used in a colon flattening pipeline. All the previous attempts of colon flatttening only consider the Euclidean metric and this is the first time a diffusion metric is used, by computing the HDD, thus making the colon flattening robust.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">THEORETICAL BACKGROUND</head><p>We present here brief theoretical fundamentals required to explain our colon flattening algorithm and to compare our method with the existing methods for colon flattening.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Conformal Mapping</head><p>Let S be a surface embedded in R 3 and g be a Riemannian metric tensor that defines the inner products on tangent planes at every point on S. Letḡ be another metric of S, such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">g = e 2ϕ g,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where ϕ : S → R is a scalar function defined on S. Then, by means of direct computation, it is easy to verify thatḡ preserves angles. Hencē g is said to be conformal (angle-preserving) to the original metric g. Given two surfaces with Riemannian metrics (S 1 , g 1 ) and (S 2 , g 2 ), consider a mapping φ : (S 1 , g 1 ) → (S 2 , g 2 ) between them. φ is said to be a conformal mapping if the pull back metric induced by φ satisfies the following relation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">φ * g 2 = e 2ϕ g 1 .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>If a Riemannian surface (S, g) is orientable, then for every point p on the surface, there exists a neighborhood U(p) and a local coordinate system (u, v) on U(p), such that the metric g can be represented as: g = e 2ϕ(u,v) (du 2 + dv 2 ). Here the coordinates, (u, v) are called as isothermal parameters or isothermal coordinates. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, we can cover the whole surface by a collection of isothermal coordinate charts. All isothermal coordinate charts form a conformal structure of the surface. The surface with a conformal structure is called a Riemann surface. Theorem 3.1. All oriented metric surfaces are Riemann surfaces.</p><p>Conformal mapping, by definition is angle preserving. For example, if any two intersecting curves γ 1 and γ 2 are mapped to f (γ 1 ) and f (γ 2 ) by a conformal map f , then the intersection angle between γ 1 and γ 2 equals to the intersection angle between f (γ 1 ) and f (γ 2 ).</p></div>

The exterior differential operator acting on ω is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">dω = (g x − f y )dx ∧ dy.<label>(3)</label></formula><p>If dω = 0, then ω is called a closed 1-form. Exact 1-forms must be closed. The space of all closed 1-forms is denoted as Ker d 1 and the space of all exact 1-forms is denoted by Img d 0 . Then, the first dimensional cohomology group H 1 (S, R) is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">H 1 (S, R) = Ker d 1 Img d 0<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Each element in H 1 (S, R) is a cohomological class. Two closed 1forms are said to be in the same class if they differ by an exact 1-form.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Heat Diffusion Distance</head><p>The heat diffusion process on the surface is governed by a partial differential equation defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">∂ u(p,t) ∂t = −∆ g u(p,t),<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where u(p,t) is the temperature or heat at a point p ∈ S at time t and ∆ g is the Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LBO) defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">∆ g = e −2ϕ(x,y) ( ∂ 2 ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 ∂ y 2 ).<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where e −2ϕ(x,y) represents the area term. The solution to Eq. 6 with the initial condition, u(p, 0) = δ (p − q), is called the heat kernel and is denoted as K g,t (p, q). Intuitively, the heat kernel can be interpreted as the amount of heat transferred from a point p to a point q in a given time t.</p><p>The LBO has an eigendecomposition of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∆ g Φ k = λ k Φ k , k = 0, 1, 2, • • • , where 0 = λ 0 &lt; λ 1 ≤ λ 2 ≤ λ 3 • • •</formula><p>are the eigenvalues and Φ k : S → R are the corresponding eigen functions. Then, the heat kernel is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">K g,t (p, q) = ∞ ∑ i=0 e −λ i t Φ i (p)Φ i (q)<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Using the definition of the heat kernel, the heat diffusion distance (HDD) at a time t is then given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">d g,t (p, q) = K g,t (p, p) + K g,t (q, q) − 2K g,t (p, q)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>An equivalent spectral expression of the heat diffusion distance is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">d 2 g,t (p, q) = S |K g,t (p, r) − K g,t (q, r)| 2 dr = ∞ ∑ i=1 e −2λ i t (Φ i (p) − Φ i (q)) 2 (10)</formula><p>where r is some point on the surface S. Eq. 10 shows that the diffusion distance is the L 2 distance between two probability distributions of Brownian motions (random walks), K g,t (p, r) and K g,t (q, r). Essentially, the mapping, p → (e −λ 1 t Φ 1 (p), e −λ 2 t Φ 2 (p), • • • ) embeds the surface to an infinite dimensional functional space. The definition in Eq. 10 shows that the heat diffusion distance is the same as the classical Euclidean metric in this functional space. Therefore, the heat diffusion distance is a Riemannian metric.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 3.3 (Lafon and Coifman)</head><p>. The heat diffusion distance defined in Eq. 10 is a Riemannian metric.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">ALGORITHM</head><p>With the theory described above, we are ready to introduce our flattening algorithm using the heat diffusion metric. Let the original input surface with handles be approximated by a triangular mesh M. This mesh M has a number of handles varying from tens to hundreds. Let γ 0 be the outer boundary and γ k , 1 ≤ k ≤ n be n inner boundaries or holes (holes are not handles) of M with topological noise. A larger value of n (greater number of holes) indicates a more complicated topology of M. Let V be the vertex set and E be the edge set of the mesh M. We</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">denote v i as the i th vertex, [v i , v j ] as the edge, [v i , v j , v k ]</formula><p>as the face, and θ i as the corner angle at vertex v i . Let the functions on M be approximated by the piecewise linear functions defined on the vertices, f (v i ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Heat Diffusion Metric</head><p>The heat diffusion distance (HDD) given by Eq. 10, introduced by Lafon et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, is computed as an average of all paths connecting two points on the surface. The HDD (diffusion process) can be obtained by the convolution of the signal and its heat kernel. Consequently, the Laplacian surface smoothing is achieved by performing diffusion on the surface that filters out the high frequency components. However, as the surface changes during smoothing, the heat kernels are also evolving. The evaluation of HDD smooths out the small perturbations (e.g., handles) on the surface and hence makes the HDD insensitive to the topological noise. As a result, the flattening algorithm using the HDD is more robust.</p><p>Using the vertex positions, we compute the edge lengths directly as l i j = |v i − v j |. We call this set of edge lengths the induced Euclidean metric. We compute the heat diffusion metric g by using the induced Euclidean metric. For every edge in the mesh we evaluate a new edge length value (HDD) and we call this set of new edge lengths the heat diffusion metric. For every face,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">[v i , v j , v k ]</formula><p>of the mesh M, the corner angles are computed by using the Euclidean cosine law as</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">θ i = cos −1 ((l 2 i j + l 2 ki − l 2 jk )/(2l i j l ki )).</formula><p>We evaluate the cotangent edge weight for every edge in M by using this corner angle to obtain a weighted adjacency matrix W := (w i j ), where w i j is the cotangent edge weight of the edge</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">[v i , v j ].</formula><p>The cotangent edge weight is defined as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">Definition 4.1 (Cotangent Edge Weight). Suppose edge [v i , v j ] is ad- jacent to two faces [v i , v j , v k ] and [v j , v i , v l ]</formula><p>, then the weight of the edge is given by: w i j = (cot θ k + cot θ l )/2.</p><p>In the next step, using W and the function values at the vertices, the LBO at each vertex is computed to obtain a Laplace-Beltrami matrix, L. In the discrete case, the LBO on a vertex is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">Definition 4.2 (Discrete Laplace-Beltrami Operator). Suppose edge [v i , v j ] is adjacent to two faces [v i , v j , v k ] and [v j , v i , v l ], then the Laplace-Beltrami Operator, ∆ g on vertex v i is given by ∆ g f (v i ) = ∑ [v i ,v j ]∈E w i j ( f (v j ) − f (v i )).</formula><p>We perform eigendecomposition of L and compute the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigen functions. Using these eigenvalues and eigen functions, we finally compute the HDD lengths of every edge in M using Eq. 10. The set of all new edge lengths forms the heat diffusion metric g.</p><p>The number of eigenvalues and the number of time steps used have an effect on the heat diffusion metric. In our case, we have used the first 50 eigenvalues and the corresponding eigen functions to calculate the HDD for the edges. Also, we choose the value of time step t in Eq. 10 to be 8 for all our cases. These respective values have been chosen experimentally by assessing the quality of the mesh that is obtained by replacing the edge lengths with the HDD values. The quality of the mesh is assessed by measuring the "closeness" of each of its faces to an equilateral triangle. For each face of the mesh we compute the ratio of its circumradius to two times its inradius. For an equilateral triangle, this ratio is equal to 1. The faces with ratio &gt; 0.6 are considered as good quality faces and &lt; 0.6 are considered as bad quality faces. We obtain the histogram of the faces of the mesh based on their ratio values. Two meshes are said to be of similar quality if they have a comparable number of bad quality faces and also comparable histograms (using L 2 -norm comparison). We have observed that by increasing the number of eigenvalues the quality of the obtained mesh improves. However, the quality did not change much after 50 eigenvalues.</p><p>The value of the time step represents the length of the path over which the heat diffusion metric is averaged. Each handle has two loops, the handle loop and the tunnel loop <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In general, their lengths are about 8 edges. Hence, we chose the value of t to be 8 so that only the handles are filtered out. If the value of t is too small, the heat diffusion metric becomes close to the induced Euclidean metric. On the other hand, if the value of t is too large, the heat diffusion metric will smooth out all the features on the surface that would make two different surfaces yield the same result. We articulate the difference between the HDD and the geodesic distance by means of a simple experiment. For this, we consider a hand model as our input where the index finger is touching the thumb as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2(a)</ref>. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>(b) we detached the two fingers, by manually cutting both the fingers at the location indicated by the red arrow, so that the topology in the two hand models is totally different. In both models, we choose two points p and q such that p is a point on the tip of the pinky finger and q is a point on the thumb nail. By using these two points as epicenters, for any point x on the surface, we compute the following distance function, f :</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">f (x) = d(p, x) + d(q, x) − d(p, q)<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Here, d can represent either the HDD or the geodesic distance. We evaluate f using both HDD and geodesic distance values for both hand models and color encode f . The color changes from blue to red with increasing f values. Figs. 2(c) and (d) show the color encoded distance function using geodesic distance values for the hand models in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figs. 2(a)</ref> and (b), respectively. It can be clearly seen that the distance function changes dramatically when the topology changes. We can also see that the geodesic distance between the points p and q, shown by a white path, has changed when the topology changed. On the other hand, Figs. 2(e) and (f) show the color encoded distance function using HDD values for the hand models in Figs. 2(a) and (b), respectively. It can be seen that the results are more consistent, showing that the topological changes do not affect the HDD function. This experiment shows that HDD is more robust to topological noises, and hence a better choice as compared to geodesic distance.</p><p>In fact, the HDD of an edge [p, q] and the original edge length are completely different. Theoretically, the HDD d g,t (p, q) is related to all paths starting from p and ending at q with length t. When t is large, the random paths cover large regions of the surface. Thus, HDD is a global concept. In contrast, the edge length of [p, q] is local. In other words, the HDD is inversely related to the connectivity of points p and q, by paths of length t, hence insensitive to topological noises.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Conformal Flattening Algorithm Based on HDD</head><p>We map the surface M with the heat diffusion Riemannian metric g conformally onto C which represents a (u, v)-planar domain. For this, we first replace all the edge lengths in M with the edge lengths from the heat diffusion metric and denote the new mesh also by M. Since M has n inner boundaries, the cohomology group and therefore its harmonic 1-form basis are n dimensional (Theorem 3.2).</p><p>The first step of our algorithm is to compute the basis for exact harmonic 1-forms of M. To compute the exact harmonic 1-forms, we first compute the harmonic functions, f k : M → R by solving the following Dirichlet problem on M for each inner boundary component γ k :</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">   ∆ g f k ≡ 0 f k | γ k = 1 f k | γ i = 0, 0 ≤ i ≤ n, i = k (12)</formula><p>The Laplace matrix ∆ g in Eq. 12 is positive definite and thus, nondegenerate. The stability of the Laplace matrix, measured by its condition number <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, depends on the mesh triangulation quality. In our case, the triangles in the mesh are close to Delaunay (Laplace matrix has a good condition number) and thus the linear system is stable. In the discrete case, the harmonic function is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">∆ g f (v i ) = ∑ [v i ,v j ]∈E w i j ( f (v j ) − f (v i )) = 0.<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Eq. 13 is the discrete Laplacian equation. The discrete harmonic function satisfies the mean value property where a function value at a vertex f (v i ) is equal to the mean of the function values of the neighboring vertices, f (v j )'s. Thus, Eq. 13 is equivalent to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">f (v i ) = ∑ [v j ,v i ]∈E w i j ∑ k w ik f (v j ),<label>(14)</label></formula><p>The discrete harmonic function f k on M is thus computed by using Eq. 14 and by solving the linear system in Eq. 12. For solving the linear system we use the publicly available UMFPACK library. Once the harmonic function f k is obtained, the exact harmonic 1-form d f k is computed as the gradient of the harmonic function as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">d f k ([v i , v j ]) = f k ∂ [v i , v j ] = f (v j ) − f (v i ).<label>(15)</label></formula><p>The n-dimensional exact harmonic 1-form basis is represented by</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">{d f 1 , d f 2 , • • • , d f n }.</formula><p>The next step of our algorithm is to compute the holomorphic 1-form basis. For this we compute the Hodge star of the exact harmonic 1-form * (d f k ) using Eq. 5, which is called the conjugate harmonic 1-form. The conjugate harmonic 1-form is also harmonic <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Section 3.3)</ref>. Intuitively, the exact harmonic 1-form and its conjugate harmonic 1-form are orthogonal everywhere. While using the Hodge star operator, in general, a regularization step is performed based on Hodge decomposition to decompose * (d f k ) into exact, coexact and harmonic components <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The exact and coexact components are discarded and only the harmonic component is retained. However, in our method, since we use a reasonably good resolution mesh the Hodge star operator is accurate enough to avoid the regularization step. Finally, by pairing each base exact harmonic 1-form with its conjugate, we obtain the set of basis for the holomorphic 1-form on M as</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">η k = d f k + i * (d f k ). Then, the holomorphic 1-form basis is represented by {η 1 , η 2 , • • • , η n }.</formula><p>In the final step, using the holomorphic 1-form basis, we compute the induced conformal mapping φ : M → C by integration that maps the surface M to a planar domain C. To start with, for each of the inner boundaries γ k , we find the corresponding shortest paths τ k connecting γ k to the outer boundary γ 0 . We cut M along one of these τ k 's to obtain a simply connected meshM. Then, we compute a unique holomorphic 1-form η = ∑ n k=1 λ k η k , λ k ∈ R, as a linear combination of the holomorphic 1-form basis, such that it satisfies the following topological condition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">Img γ 0 η = 2π, Img γ k η = −2π, Img γ i η = 0, i = 0, k<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where Img denotes the imaginary part. Here, λ k 's are a set of unknowns which are obtained by solving the linear system in Eq. 16. We then choose a base vertex p ∈ γ 0 . For any vertex q ∈M, we choose an arbitrary integration path connecting p and q inM. Finally, the conformal mapping is obtained by integrating η over this path as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">φ (q) = exp( q p η)<label>(17)</label></formula><p>Eq. 17 maps the surface M to a 2D annulus. Note that several conformal maps are possible by changing the topological conditions in Eq. 16. If we just compute the integral in Eq. 17 without the exponential, then the mapping computed will map M onto a rectangle.</p><p>Since the meshM is simply connected and η is holomorphic, the integration result is independent of the choice of the path and hence any arbitrary path can be chosen for integration to obtain the conformal mapping. In fact, the results after integration by choosing different paths are the same. In Eq. 17, we are effectively integrating d f k and * (d f k ) to obtain the conformal mapping of the mesh. Both the fields d f k and * (d f k ) are harmonic 1-forms and since any harmonic 1-form is closed (Section 3.2), it implies that both these fields are locally integrable. In our case, we assume that the fake handles on the surface are tiny (which is typical), which implies that the corresponding tunnel and the handle loops are short <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Hence, the integration of the conjugate harmonic 1-form * (d f k ) (Hodge star of exact harmonic 1form d f k ) is very close to zero. In practice, the harmonic 1-forms corresponding to the tiny handles can be neglected. Since the complex derivative (η) in Eq. 17 is a holomorphic 1-form, it is equivalent to saying that the mapping obtained by integration satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> (Section 3.3). This proves that our mapping is indeed conformal with respect to the given heat diffusion metric. We summarize our conformal mapping algorithm in Algorithm 1. Our flattening algorithm requires the input mesh to be a two dimensional manifold. In the entirety of our algorithm, we assume that the handles on the mesh surface are tiny. If the handles are large, then the harmonic 1-forms corresponding to the handles can no longer be ignored and it in turn affects the integration for computing the conformal maps. Moreover, we assume that the input mesh surface has good resolution so that the Hodge star regularization is unnecessary.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_29">v i , v j ]) = f (v j ) − f (v i )</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Generality of our Algorithm</head><p>As described above, our flattening algorithm is general and can handle flattening problems with complicated topologies containing any number of inner boundaries or holes. We now illustrate the different steps of our flattening algorithm using a genus zero surface with an arbitrary number of holes. For this, we use a complicated topology of a human face surface S with four boundary components, namely γ 0 is the outer boundary and γ 1 , γ 2 and γ 3 are the inner boundaries. Thus, n = 3 in this case. We first evaluate the heat diffusion Riemannian metric g for the face surface. Then, we compute the corresponding exact harmonic 1-forms ( Now, using the holomorphic 1-form basis, we construct a conformal mapping from the input surface (S, g) to a planar annulus domain by integration using Eq. 17. This integration is carried out along an arbitrary path using the special holomorphic 1-form (linear combination of η 1 , η 2 and η 3 ) satisfying Eq. 16. This method is popularly known as slit mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> where one of the inner boundaries of S is mapped to a circle and all the remaining boundaries are mapped to the concentric circular slits. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3(c)</ref> shows the flattening result of the face where γ 0 is mapped to the outer radius, γ 1 is mapped to the inner radius, and γ 2 and γ 3 are mapped to the slits using our algorithm. To obtain the flattening in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3(c)</ref>, we cut the face along the shortest path connecting γ 1 and γ 0 and solve Eq. 16 also over γ 1 . Two additional slit map results are possible with respect to the other two inner boundaries, γ 2 and γ 3 . If we map a checker board pattern onto the flat annulus in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3(c)</ref> and have it correspondingly mapped back onto <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3(a)</ref>, the angles and shapes inside the checker board are preserved since our algorithm is conformal. This fact is confirmed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3(b)</ref>, illustrating that our algorithm is indeed angle (shape) preserving.</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">d f 1 , d f 2 , d f 3 ), conjugate harmonic 1-forms ( * (d f 1 ), * (d f 2 ), * (d f 3 ))</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Colon Flattening</head><p>The colon surface is a special case with a simple topology (cylindrical) having only two boundary components, namely γ 0 and γ 1 (n = 1). Thus, the colon surface has only one holomorphic 1-form base, η 1 . Then, the unique holomorphic 1-form η for integration is obtained as η = λ 1 η 1 , satisfying the condition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">Img γ 0 η = 2π, Img γ 1 η = −2π,</formula><p>which is a simpler form of Eq. 16. Finally, a conformal mapping of the colon surface is obtained by integration using Eq. 17. However, in the case of colon flattening, the common practice is to map the colon onto a rectangle since it is the more intuitive way to visualize the colon surface. Hence, we compute the logarithm of the integral in Eq. 17 which now maps the colon to a rectangle instead of an annulus. In other words, we are effectively only computing the integral part of Eq. 17 without the exponential. Thus, the colon surface is conformally mapped to a planar rectangle to obtain a flattened rectangular map of the colon surface. We chose conformal mapping for the colon flattening due to the following main reason: In VC, after the colon surface is flattened, it is mandatory to preserve the local shapes. Conformal maps, by definition, are angle preserving (local shape preserving) (Section 3.1). Consequently, polyps can still be identified based on their circular shape on the flattened colon image. Our conformal flattening algorithm can be used either with the heat diffusion metric or with the original Euclidean metric. We now show that our flattening algorithm is more robust using the heat diffusion metric (obtained using the HDD) when compared to using the original Euclidean metric. For this, we consider a patch of a teapot surface with the handle and p 0 , p 1 , p 2 , p 3 being four corners on the boundary as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4(a)</ref>. We now manually cut the handle along a loop indicated by the red line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4(b)</ref>. We then use our flattening algorithm to map both the teapots in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figs. 4(a)</ref> and (b) to a planar rectangle by using the heat diffusion metric as well as the original Euclidean metric. The teapot handle is collapsed onto the plane after flattening. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figs. 4(c)</ref> and (d) show the conformal flattening results by using the original metric for <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figs. 4(a)</ref> and (b), respectively. Figs. 4(e) and (f) show the conformal flattening results by using the heat diffusion metric for <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figs. 4(a)</ref> and (b), respectively. When a surface is conformally mapped to a planar rectangle, the ratio between the height and the width of the rectangle is called the conformal module of the surface. It can be clearly seen that the conformal modules based on the original metric changed much, due to the cutting of the handle (change in topology) whereas the conformal modules based on the heat diffusion metric are similar. These experimental results confirm that the heat diffusion metric is preferrable for our flattening algorithm than the original metric, due to its insensitivity to topological noise.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS</head><p>The current approach is much more efficient and robust to topological noise when compared to previous methods. Here, we compare our method to the well known conventional holomorphic 1-form method, the conventional topological denoising method, and the Ricci flow method and show that ours fairs better for colon surfaces with noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Conventional Holomorphic 1-form Method</head><p>In the conventional holomorphic 1-form method, the most time consuming part is solving the Poisson equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Every handle on the mesh corresponds to two cohomological classes. Since the harmonic 1-forms are computed for all the cohomological classes, if the colon surface has g handles, then the Poisson equations in the conventional holomorphic 1-form method need to be solved 2g times <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In practice, there may be more than a hundred fake handles and therefore the computation is very time consuming. Hence, though theoretically this method can also be used for flattening noisy colons, it is not efficient. On the contrary, in our method, we need to solve only a single Laplace equation. This is because we only consider the cohomological class corresponding to a cylinder and ignore all the other classes (the colon is roughly cylindrical). Hence we compute only one harmonic 1-form, by solving only one Laplace equation given by Eq. 12. Thus, our method is virtually independent of the number of handles, thereby increasing the efficieny.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Conventional Topological Denoising</head><p>In the conventional topological denoising method, initially, for each handle, two loops, namely the handle loop and the tunnel loop are computed <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Then, the handle is cut along one of these loops, which are then filled with two small disks to ultimately remove the handles. In this method, it is extremely challenging and time consuming to compute the two loops for each handle since there might be hundreds of handles. Moreover, the topological surgery on the meshes is also complicated. In our method, by virtue of the metric used, all the fake handles present on the colon surface are collapsed and flattened on the destination plane. Consequently, all the vertices near the handles have non-zero curvatures. Thus, by simply evaluating the Gaussian curvature of the vertices the handles can be easily located (handles occur at vertices with non-zero curvatures). The handles can then be removed by removing the neighborhood of these vertices with non-zero curvature and filling small disks into the holes. This provides a simpler and more efficient way to remove handles compared to the traditional denoising method. We provide more elaborate details of the handle detection and removal using our method in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Ricci Flow Method</head><p>The Ricci flow method deforms the Riemannian metric to the constant curvature uniformization metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, which induces constant curvatures everywhere. This constant is solely determined by the topology of the surface. The colon surface is a topological cylinder. Hence, the uniformization metric induces zero Gaussian curvature for the interior points, and a zero geodesic curvature along the boundaries. However, for colon surfaces with topological noise (fake handles), the Ricci flow converges to a negative constant curvature metric and hence they cannot be flattened onto the Euclidean plane. Therefore, the Ricci flow method is intrinsically vulnerable to topological noise. On the contrary, our method is insensitive to topological noise and a robust flattening is achieved. For comparison, we show in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5</ref> a flattened result of the ascending colon segment, using both ours and the Ricci flow approach. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5(a)</ref> shows the flattening result of the colon segment using the Ricci flow method and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5(b)</ref> shows the flattening result of the colon segment using our method. It can be clearly seen that the Ricci flow flattening is non-regular and the global shape is lost. This is because the Ricci flow method is sensitive to noise, such as handles. On the other hand, the colon flattening using our approach is regular and the entire global shape is preserved. We compared our method with the Ricci flow approach, in terms of the colon flattening running times. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows the comparison results using different colon models and segments. The first column shows the number and segment of the colon model used. 192 and 241 are model numbers of the colon, A represents the ascending segment of the colon and T represents the transverse segment. The second column shows the number of faces in the colon model. The third column gives the time taken (in sec) for flattening the colon models using the Ricci flow method. Finally, the fourth column gives the time taken (in sec) for flattening using our method. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows that for all the colon models, our method is an order of magnitude faster than the Ricci flow method. Note that the timing details provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> only show the time taken for flattening and do not include the time taken for the metric evaluation. Since both methods use different metrics, for the sake of comparison we only use the time taken for flattening. All the experiments were conducted on a system equipped with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU with a 1.87 GHz processor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">HANDLE DETECTION AND REMOVAL</head><p>Our method of colon flattening using the heat diffusion metric is insensitive to topological noise and hence the flattening process does not require any denoising as a mandatory pre-processing step. Nonetheless, it is important to remove these topological artifacts such as the tiny handles, so that they do not obstruct any further processing of the data, that is, if the user wants to perform any further simplification of the colon data for other applications. In all the previous methods, the handles were detected and removed directly on the 3D model. Hence, only a limited visualization of the location of the handles was obtained. On the contrary, in our method, we detect the handles on the flattened colon surface and thus obtain a clear visualization of the handles. This helps us to know the location of the handles better.</p><p>By using the heat diffusion metric, the region around the handles is smoothed while flattening. As a result, a small overlapped region is formed at the location of the handles. In other words, a non-zero curvature is formed for all the vertices in the regions with handles. Thus, the problem of handle detection would simply boil down to the problem of finding all the vertices with non-zero curvature. Therefore, we calculate the Gaussian curvature for each vertex of the colon mesh. We then mark all the vertices which have a non-zero Gaussian curvature. These vertices are nothing but the vertices around the handles. In this way, all the handles can be detected in a fast and effective way.   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> shows the result obtained by using our approach to detect handles for one third segment of a flattened colon surface (starting from the cecum on the left). The green color represents the regions with zero Gaussian curvature and the red color represents the regions with non-zero Gaussian curvature. Hence, all the red regions on the colon surface in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6</ref> show the handles detected using our approach. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6</ref> also shows the close up view of a red-colored region, which confirms that it indeed is a handle (flipped triangles). Once all the handles have been detected, they can be easily removed. For this, we delete the faces around the vertices with non-zero Gaussian curvature (red regions representing handles) and subsequently fill the resulting holes with small disks. Thus, all the handles are removed to obtain a flattened colon surface free of topological noise.</p><p>We compared the speed of our approach of handle detection and removal with a previous approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Using our approach, the average time for the entire process of handle detection and removal on the colon surfaces with around 55,000 faces was 2.8 secs. On the other hand, the previous approach took an average of 800 secs to detect and remove all the handles using the same colon surface. Thus, we have obtained more than two orders of magnitude gain in speed using our approach of noise removal. In total, there were 43 handles on the colon surface shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6</ref>. We tried our approach on four other colon surfaces and all the handles in all cases were detected proving the accuracy and efficiency of our approach. We also verified the handle count obtained by our method with that obtained by the previous method <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and the value matched in all cases.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Flat Colon Rendering</head><p>The result of our method is a colon surface flattened onto a 2D rectangle, which also results in polyps being flattened. The shape of the polyps is a good clue for polyp detection and hence the rendering of the flattened colon image is crucial for their detection. Volume rendering of flattened colons has been presented and suggested for use in VC navigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. We perform the volume rendering of the flattened colon in the same way and obtain a high-quality image of the flattened colon. The volume rendered flattening result of a colon mesh model using our method is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7</ref>. Since the colon is very long, we show the flattening result in three parts. The colon stretches from the rectum which is on the left of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7(a)</ref> to the cecum which is on the right of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7(c)</ref>. We can clearly see how easy it is to examine the whole interior colon region using our method. Moreover, important features such as the polyps and the haustral folds are clearly visible and well preserved. We show the location of three polyps (1, 2 and 3) on the flattened colon surface, marked in yellow circles in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figs. 7(a)</ref> and (c). The resolution of the rendered image in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7</ref> is 3000 × 200. The rendering was performed on a system equipped with an Intel Xeon E5620 CPU and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 480 graphics board.</p><p>Polyp 1 is a large polyp of size 6.1 × 9.6 mm and can directly be inspected in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7(a)</ref>. However, polyp 2 of size 3.1 × 3.7 mm and polyp 3 of size 3.8×2.5 mm are relatively small and hard to recognize. Therefore, in a clinical application, the resolution should be at least four times higher than the one used in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7</ref>, such as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8</ref>. The rendering using the GPU provides a real-time high-quality zoomin functionality, which allows the physicians to interactively inspect suspicious regions. By having a flattened colon visualization, we are providing a better means of navigation so that no area of the colon is missed. This flattened colon visualization opens an additional option for the physician to improve the colon surface exploration.</p><p>We have also shown our results to a radiologist who was involved with the early conception of VC and has over ten years of experience in reading them. He noted that the flat rendering was realistic, and that the anatomical features such as folds, and especially significant polyps (≥6 mm in diameter) are well preserved and easily noticeable (he had not been exposed to flattened rendering prior to viewing this work). In addition, we have cross-verified the location of the polyps on the flattened colon by checking with the VC and OC reports provided by the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. We plan to conduct in the near future a more comprehensive study with radiologists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Implementation</head><p>The pipeline was implemented in C++ in a Windows environment. The volumetric rendering was performed on the GPU using OpenGL and Cg. The colon data used in this work come from volumes with an approximate size of 512 × 512 × 400 voxels. Preprocessing of the volumes includes electronic cleansing, segmentation, triangular mesh extraction, and skeleton extraction. The meshes obtained are very large (typically over 1.5 million faces) and are simplified to approximately 5% of their original size. We have successfully obtained flattening results for six different colon models. Apart from the flattening of the whole colon, we have also segmented the colon into three segments, namely ascending, transverse and descending segments. Thus, we have tested our colon flattening approach successfully with a total of 24 cases, including the segments and the whole colon surfaces. The whole process of colon flattening for an entire colon model with around 55,000 faces took an average of 23.93 sec, not including the time taken for the pre-processing of the colon. It took on average 12.38 sec to evaluate the heat diffusion metric using 50 eigenvalues and eigen functions and an average time of 11.55 sec to obtain the flattening using this heat diffusion metric.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">APPLICATIONS</head><p>Our major focus is to achieve a robust colon flattening, thereby avoiding the time-consuming topological denoising step. Since the shape information is preserved in the flattened colon, we show its application for polyp visualization, especially in hidden regions such as behind the folds. We also show how the supine and prone colon registration pipeline becomes more robust by using our method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">Polyp Visualization and Detection</head><p>One of the important applications of colon flattening is to provide a better way for the physicians to visualize and even detect the polyps. Specifically, polyps behind haustral folds are hidden and missed during the VC fly through of a 3D model. The polyps are small protrusions or bumps on the colonic wall. By using our method, all the shapes on the colon surface are preserved even after flattening. Therefore, the polyps can be clearly seen as bumps and hence form an effective means of polyp visualization. Furthermore, the volume rendering of the flattened colon provides a realistic rendering of polyps. In addition, the physician can zoom-in at the suspicious regions to confirm the location of the polyps. Thus, even relatively small polyps can be seen, as shown by few examples in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8</ref>.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7(a)</ref>; (c) Polyp 3 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7(c)</ref>, which is hidden behind a colonic fold indicated by the red arrow. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8</ref> shows a close up view of some of the polyps (protrusions) observed by navigating along the flattened colon surface. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8(a)</ref> shows a close up view of polyp 1 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7(a)</ref>, which is a large polyp. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8(b)</ref> shows a close up view of polyp 2 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7(a)</ref> which is a relatively small polyp. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8(c)</ref> shows a close up view of polyp 3 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7(c)</ref> that is hidden behind a fold (pointed to by the red arrow). It is difficult to find such polyps during navigation using a conventional VC system. However, when a flattened colon is available, even polyps hidden behind colonic folds can be observed, as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8(c)</ref>. Another example of a close up view of a polyp is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1(b)</ref>. These close up views help the physician to verify that the suspicious regions detected are indeed polyps and not some leftover stool. The shape of polyps can be identified and their sizes can be measured. Note that our technique does not provide an automatic method of polyp detection but rather makes it easy to locate, confirm, and visualize polyps, especially in areas which are otherwise hard to navigate. By performing size and shape analysis on the flat colon, we can detect the polyps automatically, which we plan to do in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2">Colon Registration</head><p>Shape registration is very fundamental for shape analysis problems, especially for abnormality detection in medical applications. The colon deformation and the diverse shapes of polyps make it difficult to distinguish polyps from other non-threatening objects in the colon. Hence, for a VC procedure, CT scans of the abdomen are commonly acquired with the patient in both supine (facing up) and prone (facing down) positions to improve the visualization of the colon wall, reduce false positives, and improve sensitivity. Comparisons between the supine and prone colon surfaces can be facilitated by computerized registration between these scans.</p><p>Registration of supine and prone colon surfaces using quasiconformal mapping has been described by Zeng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. In their approach, a costly topological denoising step is performed on both supine and prone colon surfaces before the start of the registration pipeline. Using the same registration approach, we show the registration of noisy supine and prone colon surfaces. We use our colon flattening approach to obtain the rectangular maps of supine and prone colon surfaces with handles. By virtue of our method, the flattening is not affected by the handles. We then obtain the surface feature points on these supine and prone flattened maps. Finally, using these feature points as constraints, we register the supine to prone using quasiconformal mapping steps <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Therefore, we improved the robustness of the supine and prone colon registration algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> by directly registering the supine and prone colon surfaces with handles, which otherwise was impossible without denoising.</p><p>We have analytically evaluated the quality of the registration by a distance measurement between corresponding features located on the registered colon surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Since our registration is in the 2D space using the flattened colon surfaces, a point in R 3 on the original colon surface corresponds to a point in R 2 on the registered surface. For two corresponding points (polyps or feature points used as constraints) on the supine and prone flattened colons, we compute the L 2 norm of their 2D coordinates with the width of the flattened images fixed to a unit (a) (b) <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>.

We also compute the 3D distance error by measuring the distance between the same two corresponding feature points on the supine and prone original colon surfaces (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> for details of the evaluation procedure). We have evaluated the registration using a total of 6 pairs on 2 datasets by considering 16 pairs of feature points. The average distance error is 0.0385 in R 2 and 8.14 mm in R 3 , which is comparable to the error values of Zeng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref> provides a visual verification for supine-prone colon registration. Figs. 9(a) and (b) show the registered flattened views of the ascending colon segments of supine and prone colon surfaces with handles, respectively. Two polyps found on the flattened supine surface (yellow circles in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>(a)) can be located on the flattened prone surface (yellow circles in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9(b)</ref>) at nearly the same position. Moreover, the images of the registered segments in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref> show very good alignment of the supine and prone colon structures and a good correspondence between their features, such as folds and polyps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We have introduced an efficient, robust, and shape preserving flattening algorithm for colons using the heat diffusion metric. Our method is insensitive to topological noise, such as handles, and hence does not require any topological denoising prior to the flattening. We compared our method with previous colon flattening methods and showed that our method is far more efficient in terms of speed and in preserving the global shape when there is topological noise. In addition, we proposed a fast topological denoising by evaluating the Gaussian curvature of the vertices on the flattened colon. We showed applications of our method for effective colon navigation, polyp visualization and for supine and prone colon registration. We provided supporting results for all the discussions and comparisons. As part of the future work, we plan to develop an automatic method of polyp detection using the heat diffusion metric. We also plan to generalize our approach of using the heat diffusion metric to surfaces with more complex topologies. In the near future, we plan to conduct a comprehensive study of our flattening algorithm with physicians. Finally, we plan to apply our approach of topological denoising by flattening using heat diffusion metric to other geometric processing tasks such as hole filling and remeshing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Theorem 3 . 2 (</head><label>32</label><figDesc>Hodge).

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_6"><head>Fig.</head><label></label><figDesc>Fig. 6 shows the result obtained by using our approach to detect handles for one third segment of a flattened colon surface (starting from the cecum on the left). The green color represents the regions with zero Gaussian curvature and the red color represents the regions with non-zero Gaussian curvature. Hence, all the red regions on the colon surface in Fig. 6 show the handles detected using our approach. Fig. 6 also shows the close up view of a red-colored region, which confirms that it indeed is a handle (flipped triangles). Once all the handles have been detected, they can be easily removed. For this, we delete the faces around the vertices with non-zero Gaussian curvature (red regions representing handles) and subsequently fill the resulting holes with small disks. Thus, all the handles are removed to obtain a flattened colon surface free of topological noise. We compared the speed of our approach of handle detection and removal with a previous approach [13]. Using our approach, the average time for the entire process of handle detection and removal on the colon surfaces with around 55,000 faces was 2.8 secs. On the other hand, the previous approach took an average of 800 secs to detect and remove all the handles using the same colon surface. Thus, we have obtained more than two orders of magnitude gain in speed using our approach of noise removal. In total, there were 43 handles on the colon surface shown in Fig. 6. We tried our approach on four other colon surfaces and all the handles in all cases were detected proving the accuracy and efficiency of our approach. We also verified the handle count obtained by our method with that obtained by the previous method [13] and the value matched in all cases.</figDesc></figure>
