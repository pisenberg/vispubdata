			<abstract>
				<p>Numerical ensemble forecasting is a powerful tool that drives many risk analysis efforts and decision making tasks. These ensembles are composed of individual simulations that each uniquely model a possible outcome for a common event of interest: e.g., the direction and force of a hurricane, or the path of travel and mortality rate of a pandemic. This paper presents a new visual strategy to help quantify and characterize a numerical ensemble&apos;s predictive uncertainty: i.e., the ability for ensemble constituents to accurately and consistently predict an event of interest based on ground truth observations. Our strategy employs a Bayesian framework to first construct a statistical aggregate from the ensemble. We extend the information obtained from the aggregate with a visualization strategy that characterizes predictive uncertainty at two levels: at a global level, which assesses the ensemble as a whole, as well as a local level, which examines each of the ensemble&apos;s constituents. Through this approach, modelers are able to better assess the predictive strengths and weaknesses of the ensemble as a whole, as well as individual models. We apply our method to two datasets to demonstrate its broad applicability.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Visualization plays a powerful role in addressing many forms of information uncertainty. Applications that use visual cues and illustrative quantifiers to indicate information variability or depict levels of confidence in data values help analysts better understand and cope with uncertain information. The insight obtained from such applications is essential for risk analysis and decision making tasks. Visualizing uncertainty, however, is challenging; information uncertainty is a complex concept with many domain-specific definitions and interpretations.</p><p>Common across most scientific domains is the uncertainty associated with correctly selecting a set of domain-specific interpretations, processes, and mathematical systems to estimate -through numerical simulation -the behaviors of some event of interest (e.g., a weather system or the direction of subsurface aqueous flows). This uncertainty, referred to as conceptual model uncertainty, is arguably the greatest source of error and risk associated with modeling and forecasting, and is the primary uncertainty considered by risk analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</p><p>One of the most powerful ways to address conceptual model uncertainty is with an aggregate prediction that combines, through a weighted average, predictions made by a numerical ensemble <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. The ensemble itself is a collection of individual simulations, where each simulation is based on a unique conceptual model defined by a distinct set of initial conditions and modeling parameters. The premise behind aggregation strategies is that no single constituent can perfectly model the event of interest because the specific processes and systems governing the event are largely unknown. The best model, therefore, must be estimated via a weighted combination of the ensemble's constituents; estimates for these weights are obtained through statistical methods: e.g., bootstrap aggregation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In practice the premise behind aggregation strategies is valid: aggregate predictions can outperform individual ensemble constituents <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>.</p><p>Though aggregation strategies help ameliorate conceptual model uncertainty (by eliminating the need to rely on a single conceptual model) and can provide better predictive performance, they also have an inherent shortcoming: aggregate predictions do not help modelers better understand the processes and mechanisms governing the target event of interest. More specifically, the weights used to combine the ensemble's predictions do not generalize to combine the underlying conceptual models in the ensemble that represent distinct, often conflicting, hypotheses. To better address conceptual model uncertainty, modelers need visualization strategies that can augment the benefits of aggregate prediction with visual information that can help modelers identify the predictive strengths and weaknesses of an ensemble and its constituents. Only by identifying such traits can modelers iterate and improve on successful conceptual designs to reduce predictive uncertainty: a measure of conceptual convergence that measures the ability for a numerical ensemble's constituents to consistently and accurately predict an event of interest based on ground truth observations. This work presents a visualization strategy that leverages BMA to generate an aggregate prediction. We use BMA in this work because BMA-based predictions are highly accurate <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>, are known to outperform predictions obtained from other statistical methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>, and are successfully applied across many domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. Weuse BMA to direct a two-step visual analysis. In the first step, the aggregate prediction helps quantify ensemble bias and variance (components of predictive uncertainty) based on ground truth measurements for an event of interest. These two metrics support a spatial segmentation strategy that identifies regions of low and high predictive uncertainty for the ensemble. In the second step, we analyze the value of individual ensemble members within the context of the ensemble to identify where specific constituents (and their conceptual models) help increase predictive accuracy. Combined, these visualization strategies help modelers identify and characterize both successful and unsuccessful predictive trends in an ensemble.</p><p>Overall the contributions of this work are as follows.</p><p>• We present a new analysis method to quantify and characterize predictive uncertainty in numerical ensembles. The strategy uses a Bayesian framework (Section 3) that combines ground truth and numerical ensemble data to form an aggregate prediction that addresses an important sparse data challenge.</p><p>• We extend this framework with a visual segmentation strategy that highlights the strengths and weaknesses of a numerical ensemble as a whole: e.g., regions where ensembles consistently estimate a target event accurately, or inaccurately.</p><p>• We augment this visualization technique with a second method that characterizes and segments the predictive strengths and weaknesses of individual ensemble constituents. This segmentation identifies the ensemble members (and thus conceptual models) that are more accurate than other ensemble constituents.</p><p>In the next section we discuss work germane to our efforts. This overview is followed by the presentation of our method (Section 3). We then apply our method to two datasets to demonstrate the method's ability to characterize and help quantify predictive error and predictive uncertainty (Section 5). Finally, we discuss future work (Section 6).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Taxonomies for Uncertainty</head><p>Much has been done to establish a basic foundation for uncertainty visualization. To address the complex, multifaceted nature of uncertainty, many visualization researchers have presented varying formal models and typologies. Pang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> present a model that delineates three types of uncertainty. These uncertainties, which correspond to sequential stages in the visualization pipeline, include the uncertainties associated with data measurements and collection, data transformations, and the uncertainties associated with visualizing the data itself. Plewe's <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> complementary work defines the uncertainty associated with process and model conceptualization. This form of uncertainty, which we refer to as conceptual model uncertainty, arises when models are first being selected and designed, and occurs before the uncertainty stages defined by Pang et al. Conceptual uncertainty is viewed as the greatest source of error in modeling tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. Our work uses ground truth, ensemble estimates, and BMA to present one of the first approaches that directly addresses characterizing the uncertainties defined by Plewe and Pang et al.</p><p>Thomson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> present a formal typology for uncertainty in the context of geospatial data. This work, along with MacEachren et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, suggests that uncertainty is best addressed by jointly considering multiple categories of information that affect uncertainty, such as data error, precision of information, completeness of data, and consistency of information sources. Our work is motivated by these works in that we account for a wide variety of sources for data in order to address predictive uncertainty. We extend these works with a visual framework that can help segment spatial data by levels of collective and individual modeling bias and error.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Uncertainty in Visualization</head><p>Many researchers have addressed the perceptual issues of visualizing uncertain data. Several researchers have employed transparency to convey uncertainty in data values <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Color is a principal channel that has also been used to convey uncertainty information <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. MacEachren <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> explores four aspects of color to convey information about uncertain data including color saturation, crispness, transparency, and image resolution. Hengle <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> explores mapping predictions and error into the hyperspectral imaging color space with a color mixture concept. We utilize color to indicate degrees of predictive uncertainty in our geospatial segmentation.</p><p>Visualization strategies themselves have been the focus of uncertainty analysis with the goal of characterizing the bias that visualization techniques place on the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. Prassni et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> address the uncertainties associated with slice techniques as applied to volumetric data and propose a guided probabilistic volume segmentation strategy. This strategy directs the user's attention to regions of high uncertainty to avoid misclassification of medical data. Grigoryan and Rheingans <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> combine point based rendering with other pseudocoloring and shading to convey trends in surface-based uncertainties.</p><p>Uncertainty visualization strategies have also been proposed for specific types of data including vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>, tensor fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and, more recently, numerical ensemble data <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. Focusing on a global definition of uncertainty, Otto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> address the uncertainty of flow topology itself and define a process for obtaining an uncertainty-aware topological segmentation for 2D flow fields. Our work extends these contributions by addressing the challenges of visualizing uncertainty in ensemble data based on ground truth data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Visualization and Ensemble Uncertainty</head><p>Recent visualization efforts have addressed the notion of characterizing the uncertainty inherent in numerical ensembles. Potter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> present an application that addresses the uncertainty in numerical climate model ensembles. This work characterizes ensemble complexity through localized mean and variance properties. Specifically, for any spatial region b ∈ R 3 for the ensemble, there will be a mean and variance associated with the value obtained from the p ensemble members. Potter et al. plot the mean and standard deviation of these values across a series of different visualizations (e.g., height fields and iso-contours).</p><p>Sanyal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> also use localized statistical measures to assess uncertainty in numerical weather ensembles. Sanyal et al. distinguish their work from that of Potter et al. by employing a bootstrapping strategy to estimate localized mean and variances. They apply their bootstrapped mean and variance values to various 2D visualizations (e.g., colormaps, ribbons, and glyphs) to convey ensemble uncertainty.</p><p>Our work also assess uncertainty in numerical ensembles. However, in contrast to existing literature, which quantifies uncertainty through statistical variance, this work incorporates ground truth observations into our analysis to account for both predictive error (i.e., statistical bias) and predictive variability (i.e., statistical variance). As a result, unlike previous methods, this work distinguishes between low variance predictions that are accurate from those that are inaccurate (consensus and accuracy are two different attributes of an ensemble). Our work is also distinct from existing literature in that we analyze ensemble data from two standpoints: we analyze the ensemble as a whole, and we analyze the value of individual members within the context of the ensemble to identify where specific constituents (and their conceptual assumptions) help to increase predictive accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Statistical Model Specification</head><p>Our work's statistical foundation is based on a Bayesian technique for model specification (i.e., the task of selecting variables to use for regression). There are many general methods for performing this task: ordinary least squares, forward regression, backward regression, and step-wise regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. There are also many specialized techniques that address specific challenges related to specification including the Dantzig selector <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, ridge regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and Mallow's Cp statistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. All of these approaches, however, specify a single model for inference tasks and thus ignore statistical model uncertainty: the uncertainty and risk associated with selecting a single statistical model over other suitable models for inferencing tasks. Failure to address this uncertainty can greatly impair predictive performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>.</p><p>Bayesian model averaging (BMA) directly addresses statistical model uncertainty by inferencing based on a weighted average of the statistical model space. By accounting for uncertainty in both predictions and parameter estimates, BMA overcomes individual model bias and variance to provide more consistent, accurate predictions. Our use of BMA is thus motivated by BMA's foundation of theoretical benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref> and the empirical realization of these benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>.Though literature shows that BMA inferences can be beat <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> (and that Bayesian methods in general can be sensitive and error prone <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>), in practice, BMA demonstrates consistent performance that outperforms many specification methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHOD</head><p>This work presents a new method for quantifying and characterizing predictive uncertainty in numerical ensembles. Our framework directly supports a visual segmentation strategy that highlights regions of uncertainty for numerical ensembles and ensemble constituents. We first present the formalisms needed to discuss our method (Section 3.1). We then introduce Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) as an aggregation strategy for numerical ensemble data and show how BMA can be used to estimate behavior for a target event (Section 3.2). Later, we use this estimate to characterize predictive uncertainty in a numerical ensemble with a two-part visualization strategy (Section 4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Formalism</head><p>The principle task in predictive modeling is to estimate the behavior of an unknown function f D : R 3 → R that defines some processes of interest P on a domain D ⊂ R 3 . Since f D is unknown, it cannot be evaluated. This work addresses the case where f D can be measured at a finite set of points S := {s i | s i ∈ D, i = 1, . . . , n}, called the sample set. In measuring f D at these points, we obtain the response y : n × 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y :=&lt; f D (s 1 ), . . . , f D (s n ) &gt;<label>(1)</label></formula><p>This case also includes a set of unique conceptual models C := {c j | j = 1, . . . , p} that each distinctly define a likely scenario that postulates how to estimate f D . Through computer-assisted numerical simulation, each c j generates a predictive response function, f j : R 3 → R on D. We define F := { f j | j = 1, . . . , p} as the collection of all predictive response functions and refer to F as the numerical ensemble.</p><p>Predictive uncertainty for F is defined through joint consideration of the mean predictive error (i.e., statistical bias) and the predictive variability (i.e., statistical variance) of the f ∈ F <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. Thus, for ground truth observation y i at location s i ∈ S, we quantify predictive uncertainty for F through the mean squared error (MSE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">MSE y (s i ) = p − 1 p σ 2 (s i ) + η(s i ) 2 = ∑ p j=1 ( f j (s i ) − f (s i )) 2 p + ( f (s i ) − y i ) 2 (2)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f (s i ) = ∑ p j=1 f j (s i ) p</formula><p>denotes the mean estimate, σ 2 the statistical variance, and η the statistical bias of the ensemble at point s i .</p><p>Note the quantifying predictive uncertainty in Equation 2 requires ground truth measurements, y i , to determine statistical bias (η). Unfortunately, due to factors associated with cost and time, ground truth for many domains is often very limited both spatially and temporally. This sparsity of ground truth often hinders the ability to quantify and characterize predictive uncertainty for analysis and visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Bayesian Model Averaging</head><p>BMA addresses this sparse data challenge by combining all f ∈ F through a weighted coefficient, β BMA : p × 1 that can estimate f D (b), ∀b ∈ D. BMA's ability to address statistical model uncertainty during model specification provides significant inferencing benefits over other methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. Importantly, BMA also addresses conceptual model uncertainty: by estimating f D through a combination of all ensemble members, the risks associated with relying on a single model to estimate f D are avoided.</p><p>To form this aggregate, BMA forms a linear relationship between all ensemble members, f j , and the observations in y. Formally, let x ( j) : n × 1 be an estimate for y based on the sample space S such that x ( j) contains the value of f j evaluated at all sample points s i</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">x ( j) :=&lt; f j (s 1 ), . . . , f j (s n ) &gt; (3)</formula><p>The combination of x ( j) forms the estimate matrix, X : n × p = [x <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> , . . . , x <ref type="bibr">(p)</ref> ]. This matrix and y, define a linear regression model</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">y = X β + ε<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where each X * , j corresponds to the j th constituent in the numerical ensemble, the parameter vector β : p × 1 defines the unknown relationship between the ensemble's constituents, and ε : n × 1 is the vector of random errors associated with the observed values in y.</p><p>Aggregation strategies estimate f D by first solving for β , and then using this parameter vector to combine all f ∈ F through a weighted average. In practice, the ensemble estimate matrix X is rarely composed of sample vectors from all ensemble members, but may be constructed from a subset of ensemble member estimates. More specifically, approximations for β can be derived from any combination of the p estimates in X. As there are K = 2 p − 1 distinct combinations of these estimates, there are (at least) the same number of β that may be considered for Equation 4. We let M define the space of these β</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">M := {β (k) | β (k) ∈ R p , k = 1, . . . , K}<label>(5)</label></formula><p>We distinguish these possible β (k) by first representing k in bitform.

We denote m k as the statistical model based on β (k) and X (k) and we use m k to refer to a given statistical model during the aggregation process (see Equations 8 -13). As an example, let p = 3 resulting in 7 distinct β (k) and X (k) pairs: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> , x <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> , x <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> ] where b 1 , . . . , b 12 ∈ R.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">k = 1 β (1) =&lt; b 1 , 0, 0 &gt; X (1) = [x (1) , 0, 0] k = 2 β (2) =&lt; 0, b 2 , 0 &gt; X (2) = [0, x (2) , 0] k = 3 β (3) =&lt; b 3 , b 4 , 0 &gt; X (3) = [x (1) , x (2) , 0] ... ... ... k = 7 β (7) =&lt; b 10 , b 11 , b 12 &gt; X (7) = [x</formula></div>

Unfortunately, while many of these β may accurately fit this system for a given y and X, there is often great variability in the accuracy of these β when they extrapolate from y to estimate f D .

It is reasonable therefore, in the absence of any further changes to y, to use these coefficients to combine the ensemble of predictive response functions f ∈ F with the intent to estimate the unknown function of interest to our analysis, f D .

We use this surface as the best estimate of f D , based on the quality of the coefficient vector β BMA . Consequently, f BMA will be the standard to which the ensemble constituents, f i will be compared. Additionally, predictive uncertainty for all b ∈ D for F is quantified by replacing y j in Equation 3 with f BMA . • Type I -Low predictive uncertainty ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, lower left quadrant) Locations b ∈ D where F has low variance and low absolute bias indicate regions where model estimates converge around f BMA with a high degree of accuracy.

In these cases, the estimate obtained from f j appears to be performing worse than most models. This may indicate that portions of the conceptualization in the underlying model are flawed (especially if this classification for f j is predominant for b ∈ D ).</p><p>We differentiate between these cases by examining the predictive performance for individual f j where this performance is based on the residual differences between f j and f BMA .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Threshold Values and Classification Instability</head><p>In many domains, policy makers and regulators set strict limits for modeling bias and variance (c |η| and c σ 2 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. When these thresholds are set in dense areas of an estimate distribution, classification can be unstable: i.e., minor threshold changes can result in large changes for visual segmentation. We provide a metric to assess classification instability. Formally, let S := {s ∈ R | 0 ≤ s &lt; ∞} be values valid for c σ 2 and T := {t ∈ R | 0 ≤ t &lt; ∞} be values valid for c |η| . Section 4.1 defines a classification function C F : S × T → (D → C ), where C := {1, 2, 3, 4} is the set of possible classifications for the ensemble. (a) Accurate Estimates -This subfigure depicts two cases where low residual error, g j (b), indicates that f j generates accurate estimates for the given b ∈ D. In Case I (left), the residual error is within one standard deviation of the ensemble's mean estimate (i.e., δ j (b) ≤ σ g (b)): much of the ensemble is thus generating accurate estimates. Contrariwise, Case II (right) indicates that the estimate is an outlier to the ensemble's mean estimate; f j is thus one of a few number of models that accurately estimates the target event for b.  . In these subfigures, the distributions are based on the residual error obtained from F for a given b ∈ D. In these distributions, c |η| indicates the window (centered around zero error) where estimates are accurate <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 2a)</ref> or inaccurate <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 2b)</ref>. σ g (b) indicates the window around the ensemble's mean error estimate, g(b) that distinguishes between estimates that are in consensus with g(b) (e.g., left-region of distributions in 2a and 2b) and estimates that are outliers (e.g., right-region of distributions in 2a and 2b).</p><p>To assess classification instability for an ensemble, we compute the change of C F in directions ds and dt as</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">I F (s,t) = d(C F (s,t),C F (s + ds,t + dt)) (ds + dt)<label>(19)</label></formula><p>where the distance function, d, is defined on classifiers h :</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">D → C as d(h 1 , h 2 ) := ∑ b∈D (h 1 (b) = h 2 (b)).</formula><p>Since d returns the number of measurement locations that change their classification when replacing classifier h 1 by h 2 , visualizing I F can guide threshold value selection, or confirm (in)stability for specified thresholds <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Fig. 4 and Fig. 9</ref>). For interpretability, we normalize I F by the largest possible classification change that can occur: i.e., the case that all b ∈ D change classification based on ds and dt. Thus instead of cell counts, we visualize I F as a percentage (1-100%) of the total possible classification instability for F.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Addressing Cases Where Ground Truth is Absent</head><p>A core requirement for this work is the need for accurate ground truth measurements. This requirement can be a limitation for our method: in cases where ground truth is unreliable (e.g., noisy or too sparse) our method may misclassify models; if there is no baseline for ensemble comparison, our method is not immediately applicable. Note, however, ground truth is not the only baseline for assessing an ensemble.</p><p>During early experimental stages when ground truth is not yet available, predictive modeling tasks often rely on a baseline model (e.g., reduced order models <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>), called a parsimonious model. The parsimonious model is the Occam's razor of conceptual models: it balances simplicity in conceptual design (e.g., domain-specific interpretations, processes, and mathematical systems) with sufficiency in explanatory power to describe an event of interest. Parsimonious models, however, are based on a collection of reasonable assumptions and do not represent potential outlier conceptualizations that may in fact be valid. Reliance on the parsimonious model alone thus represents a belief that the most common, reasonable model decisions are correct; this assumption is not always correct and for risk analysis it is essential to compare alternate cases to the more common expected outcome.</p><p>Our methods characterize predictive uncertainty in an ensemble of models that explore conceptual complexities that are not accounted for by the parsimonious model (see Section 5.2). Uncertainty characterization in this context for ensembles and their constituents is nearly identical to characterization with ground truth. The difference is that uncertainty characterization based ground truth indicates the degree that ensembles/models effectively model the target event; uncertainty characterization based on parsimonious estimates identify the degree that conceptual complexities cause estimates to deviate from general assumptions about how the target event should behave.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">VISUALIZATION APPLICATION AND ANALYSIS</head><p>We present results from two applications of our method. In our application space, the conceptual design process is iterative and can take years to develop an ensemble of reliable, accurate models. Our work does not focus on the direct comparison and re-design of conceptual models as this task is highly domain dependent. Instead, we use our domain-agnostic segmentation to direct modelers to specific models and regions where estimates indicate (in)effective design choices.</p><p>The summary feedback from modelers is that they view this work as an "extremely important visualization approach" for two reasons. First, they view the ability to identify accurate pathways in subsurface regions (Type I-II regions) as critical for improving conceptual designs. Specifically, by isolating conceptual designs (e.g., porosity and permeability fields) based on Type I-II regions and using these designs as a basis for future models, they feel they will help preserve accurate conceptual designs choices and their predictive benefits in future design iterations. Second, they view the approaches's ability to identify Type III-IV regions based on our estimate-based segmentation as important for addressing risk analysis: if bias and variability is too great in certain regions, these regions are where further well log data should be gathered to help tune the next iteration of conceptual models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Estimating a Chemical Tracer in Bioremediation</head><p>This analysis characterizes predictive uncertainty in a numerical ensemble that estimates a plume of bromine (a chemical tracer) in a bioremediation field study. The objective of the field study is to better understand the underlying subsurface so that bioremediation efforts in this area will be more effective.</p><p>To help meet this objective, a series of injection pumps <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 3</ref>'s distribution wells) were used to pump a chemical tracer into the regions' ground water. For four months, the concentration of the tracer was measured weekly at 12 sample wells, where each well's measurements were made at three different depths. During the field study, a numerical ensemble of twenty models made estimates for the concentration of the chemical tracer throughout the region. Constituents were based on a distinct conceptual model for the region, and all models were based on an irregular hexahedral grid (56 X 43 X 48 nodes).</p><p>We characterize the ensemble's predictive uncertainty for the set of measurements collected during the last week of the field study's third month. We begin by estimating F BMA (Equation 8). Ground truth for <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>: The instability field for the bioremediation ensemble. Here, red lines indicate an instability measure of 22% based on thresholds for c σ (1.75e-4) and c |η| (2.2e-4); these values also shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6's scatterplot.</ref> the tracer forms the response vector, y, and the ensemble's estimates (based on 36 measurements in sample set S) form the matrix X.</p><p>The slices in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> are estimates from two ensemble constituents, Models 1 and 2, and a BMA-based estimate for the tracer plume. In these figures, units are in moles of tracer per liter of water. The slices all show a cross-section taken into the region where the first set of observation wells are approximately located (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 3</ref>). <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>'s color map (far right) indicates the concentration of the tracer. In all slices, isocontours are for 4.0e-4 (outmost contour), 6.0e-4 (middle contour), and 1.2e-3 (inner contour) moles per liter.</p><p>Next we quantify and characterize the ensemble's predictive uncertainty (Section 4.1). Values for maximal variance, c σ , and absolute bias, c |η| , were set at 2.2e-4 and 1.75e-4 moles per liter respectively; these values were motivated by a regulation-specified scenario for assigned bias and variance (Section 4.3). Based on the ensemble's generated instability field <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref>, these thresholds create only modest instability: 22% from the ensemble's max instability of 33%. From these thresholds we partition all estimates based on predictive uncertainty (Section 4). From this partition, we show three visualizations that characterize the ensemble's predictive uncertainty; all images are color-coded by the colormap at the far right of <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>.</p><p>The "Scatter Plot" in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> shows the nodes for the ensemble's underlying grid (56 × 40 × 43 nodes total); here each node is plotted by its ensemble-based variance and absolute bias. The contours indicate the increasing density of nodes. The four colors in this image correspond to the types of uncertainty. In general there is a high degree of Type IV uncertainty indicating divergence in the ensemble and a great deal of error in estimates with respect to ground truth.</p><p>The "Cells" image in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> shows all nodes in the "Scatter Plot" images based on their location in the region. Each node is rendered as a single hexahedral cube and colored according the node's classification for predictive uncertainty. The image shows a cut-away view of the region to better see the coherent patterns of the various types of predictive uncertainty. Note that three light green channels run through the center of the region; these Type III predictive uncertainty regions indicate locations where the ensemble as a whole is estimating in a consistent, though erroneous, way. Modelers proposed these regions may help determine future sites for obtaining ground truth (e.g. new well logs); such data would help to develop better conceptual models.</p><p>The "Slice" image in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> shows a cross-section through the region. As with the slices in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>, this image is based on a slice made 30 meters below the subsurface. The isocontours are the contours made for the BMA-based estimate in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. Contrasting isocontours with colors for characterized predictive uncertainty, we identify that most of the higher concentration regions of the tracer correspond to regions of higher, Type III and IV predictive uncertainty.</p><p>We characterize predictive uncertainty for two ensemble constituents based on the methods provided in Section 4.2. Values for absolute bias, c |η| , and absolute error, |g j ()| (both 2.2e-4 moles per liter) segment the estimates of both models. From this partition, we construct three visualizations to characterize each model's predictive uncertainty; all images are color-coded by the colormap in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>.</p><p>The "Scatter Plot" images in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref> help to distinctly characterize and contrast predictive uncertainty for Model 1 and Model 2. Based on density contours, estimates from Model 1 are significantly more accurate and consistent than Model 2. In <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>'s "Cells" images, we see estimates from Model 1 and 2 based on spatial location in the do-   main. Here each model's estimate is rendered as a hexahedral cell and colored by its classification of predictive uncertainty. Note that both Models have three yellow channels of Case III predictive uncertainty similar to channels in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. These channels support previous evidence that there is a common set of erroneous estimates in the ensemble's constituents. Based on this information, modelers were interested in comparing the underlying conceptual permeability fields across the ensemble in these regions. They felt identifying common distributions in permeability in these regions, if redesigned, may reduce estimate errors.</p></div>

The event began after rising groundwater flooded a set of compromised CCL 4 containment tanks. Significant amounts of CCL 4 were removed from containment once the ground water began to subside <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Fig. 8)</ref>.</p><p>The field study uses a parsimonious model as a ground truth surrogate while monitoring data is collected. The parsimonious model, which is defined on a sparse, irregular grid of 5 × 20 × 30 nodes, assumes homogeneity for several geological modeling parameters: e.g., a constant value of porosity and permeability. We apply our methods for characterizing predictive uncertainty to a numerical ensemble of twelve models that explore varied complexities in the regions' stratigraphic layers (e.g., distributions of values rather than constant values for permeability and porosity). These models rely on a dense regular grid of 50 × 200 × 300 nodes. In this analysis, we consider estimates for the plume based on one year of active transport.</p><p>We begin by estimating F BMA (Equation 8). In this task, the parsimonious model's estimate forms the response vector, y, and the ensemble's estimates (based on sample set S) form the ensemble matrix X. The slices shown for Models 1 and 2 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref> are the estimates from two ensemble constituents for the plume's concentration. The third image <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref> is the BMA-based estimate for the plume. The slices all show concentrations at 30 meters beneath the subsurface (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8</ref>). This figure's color map indicates CCl 4 concentration in µgrams per liter. In all images, isocontours for 500 (outmost contour), 1000 (middle contour), and 2000 (inner contour) are shown.</p><p>Next we quantify and characterize the ensemble's predictive uncertainty (Section 4.1). Values for maximal variance, c σ , and absolute bias, c |η| , were set at 450 and 500 µgrams per liter respectively; these values were motivated by a regulation-specified scenario for assigned bias and variance (Section 4.3). Based on the ensemble's generated instability field <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Fig. 9</ref>), these thresholds create very little instability: 12% from the ensemble's max of 25%. From these thresholds we determine ensemble-based bias and standard deviation for each node in the dense regular grid. We partition the nodes based on their classification of predictive uncertainty (Section 4.1). From this partition, we construct three visualizations to characterize the ensemble's predictive uncertainty. The "Scatter Plot" in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref> shows the nodes for the dense grid where each node is plotted by its ensemble-based variance and absolute bias. In this image contours indicate density of estimates and colors indicate types of uncertainty.</p><p>The "Cells" image in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref> shows all nodes in the "Scatter Plot" images based on their location in the region. Regions with Type I predictive uncertainty are shown in purple. These regions indicate that despite conceptual complexities, constituents strongly agree with each other and the parsimonious model. In contrast, green regions (Type IV) are where constituent estimates vary internally and deviate from the parsimonious model. Modelers felt these regions indicated that complex designs in the ensemble based on heterogeneity in stratigraphy were significantly altering estimates from parsimonious assumptions of homogeneity. As a future step, they felt obtaining well log data in these regions would help determine if heterogeneity in stratigraphy was, in fact, valid to adopt in new conceptual designs.</p><p>The "Slice" image in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref> shows a slice through the region. As with the slices in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>, this image is based on a slice made 30 meters below the subsurface. The isocontours are the contours made for the BMA-based estimate for 500 (outmost contour), 1000 (middle contour), and 2000 (inner contour) µgrams per liter. By contrasting these isocontours with colors for characterized predictive uncertainty, we can identify that most, but not all, of the higher concentration regions of CCl 4 (see the inner contour) correspond to regions of higher predictive uncertainty (i.e., Type III and IV).</p><p>We characterize predictive uncertainty for two of the ensemble's constituents based on the methods provided in Section 4.2. In this analysis, we use values of 500 µgrams per liter for both absolute bias, and absolute error. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref> contains image sets for Models 1 and 2 that contain images for "Scatter Plots", "Cells", and "Slice" techniques. The color map in this figure characterizes predictive uncertainty for each constituent-based estimate in these images. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref>'s "Scatter Plot" images help to distinctly characterize and contrast predictive uncertainty for Model 1 and Model 2. Based on density contours, Model 1 has more nodes in Case II than Model 2. This trend indicates many of Model 1's nodes consistently estimate the way the parsimonious model does when other ensemble constituents do not (e.g., Model 2). While Model 2 also has some nodes classified as Case II, the density contours for Model 2 indicate more of its nodes are classified as Case III and IV. Such classifications indicate that many of Model 2's estimates deviate from the parsimonious model.</p><p>The "Cells" images in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref> show the spatial representation of the scatter plot distributions for Models 1 and 2. The distinct green regions for Model 1 indicate the locations where Model 1's estimate is close to the parsimonious model's estimate. In contrast, Model 2 has a predominance of yellow regions that indicate most of Model 2's estimate for the plume are significantly different from the parsimonious estimate. The red regions in both models indicate regions where the models' estimate deviate from the parsimonious model and the majority of ensemble estimates. These regions are most likely related to the unique conceptualization of the models' designs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref>'s "Slice" images convey similar information to the cell's images; slices are based on a depth of 30 meters beneath the subsurface. The iso-contours of CCl 4 concentration (500, 1000, and 2000 µgrams per liter) in these images help correlate uncertainty with increasing CCl 4 concentration. For example, much of Model 1's estimate within the 2000 iso-contour line is characterized as Case II or III predictive uncertainty; in contrast Model 2 is characterized as Case III.</p></div>

The cutaway shows the interior of the ensemble's segmentation. The Slice view shows various types of predictive uncertainty for a vertical cross-section cut into the region (see the slice in Fig. 3 for reference). Isocontours correspond to the same contours in Fig. 5: 4.0e-4 (outmost contour), 6.0e-4 (middle contour), and 1.2e-3 (inner contour) moles per liter. Uncertainty Characterization of Individual Models These three figures depict results of our method's application to two models (top and bottom row) that estimate the path of a chemical tracer in a bioremediation field study. In these figures, we analyze the estimates for a chemical tracer based on a three month duration for drift. In all images regions are colored based on predictive uncertainty classification (Section 4.2): blue (Case I); green (Case II); yellow (Case III); and red (Case IV). The classification is based on δ and an absolute error threshold of 2.2e-4 moles per liter. Scatter Plot views show the characterization of all nodes in the underlying numerical grid (56 X 40 X 43 nodes) used by both models; cells are plotted δ vs. absolute error to the BMA estimate. The Cell shows the same nodes rendered spatially in the subsurface region; here each node is rendered as a colored hexahedral cell. The Slice view shows the various types of predictive uncertainty in the ensemble for a vertical cross-section cut two meters into the region (see the slice inFig. 3 for reference). Isocontours correspond to the same contours inFig. 5: 4.0e-4 (outmost contour), 6.0e-4 (middle contour), and 1.2e-3 (inner contour) moles per liter.</figDesc></figure>

Three concentrations of CCl 4 are shown in this image as isocontour lines (i.e., the white lines): 500 (outmost contour), 1000 (middle contour), and 2000 (inner contour) µgrams per liter. Ensemble Uncertainty Characterization These three figures depict results from our method (Section 4.1) for characterizing uncertainty and segmenting the CCl 4 ensemble. In all three images regions are color coded based on predictive uncertainty (Section 4.1): dark purple (Type I); light purple (Type II); light green (Type III); and dark green (Type IV). This characterization process is based on thresholds for σ and η of 450 and 500 respectively. The Scatter Plot view shows all nodes where nodes are plotted by ensemble std deviation and absolute bias. The Cells view shows the nodes rendered and colored by ensemble classification; the cutaway shows the interior of the ensemble's segmentation. The Slice view shows the various types of predictive uncertainty in the ensemble at 30 meters beneath the subsurface. Isocontours correspond to the same contours in Fig. 10 for 500 (outmost contour), 1000 (middle contour), and 2000 (inner contour) µgrams per liter. Uncertainty Characterization of Individual Models These images depict results from our method (Section 4.2) for characterizing and segmenting individual models based on their predictive uncertainty. In this figure, the estimates of Model 1 (top) and Model 2 (bottom) are analyzed at approximately one year during the CCl 4 event. In all images regions are colored based on predictive uncertainty (Section 4.2): blue (Case I); green (Case II); yellow (Case III); and red (Case IV). The classification itself is based on δ and an absolute error threshold of 500. Scatter Plot views show the characterization of all nodes; here cells are plotted δ vs. absolute error to the BMA estimate. The Cell views show the model's estimates colored by classification; the cutaway shows the interior of each model's segmentation. The Slice view shows the various types of predictive uncertainty in the ensemble at 30 meters beneath the subsurface. Isocontours correspond to the same contours inFig. 10for 500 (outmost contour), 1000 (middle contour), and 2000 (inner contour) µgrams per liter.</figDesc></figure>
