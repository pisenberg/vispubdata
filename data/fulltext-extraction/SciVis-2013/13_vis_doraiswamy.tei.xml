				<p>Fig. 1. Studying cloud systems at different scales. Our framework is used to study the movement of the equatorial Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) over the Indian Ocean. Given the IR brightness temperatures over the island of Borneo, we first identify the set of clouds. Users can select clouds of interest and track their movement. Smaller scale cloud systems embedded in a MJO move in a westward direction. The manifestation of a convectively coupled kelvin wave results in a temporary eastward movement of parts of the cloud cluster. Such movement can be easily obtained using the querying ability of our framework. The rightmost figure shows a subset of the clouds that move eastward for at least 90 minutes. The temporary movement is indicated by the fact that the movement reverts to its original westward direction after a short duration. Our framework also helps quantify the overall eastward propagation of the MJO.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Clouds play a very important role in tropical circulation. They are a source of heating through latent heat release. They also interact and modify radiation by reflecting and absorbing radiation. Cloud systems, sometimes known as Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS), consist of a collection of clouds of varying heights. These include tall growing and mature Cumulonimbus(Cb) clouds surrounded by a stratus (lower clouds) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The tall clouds are the mature cumulus cells and could be as high as 15 km, which is the typical tropopause height in the tropics. The cloud systems could also move, grow and decay. These MCS in turn could be embedded in larger systems such as a tropical cyclone. Considerable amount of rain can occur in association with such MCS. Movements of cloud systems could have large temporal and spatial scales such as the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), which has a spatial scale ranging from 1000 km to 10000 km and time of oscillation of around 40 days. Embedded within these larger scale oscillations are a hierarchy of cloud clusters which could have smaller spatial and temporal scales such as the Nakazawa cloud clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. These smaller cloud clusters, while being part of the equatorial MJO, sometimes move at speeds different from the larger scale and in a direction opposite to that of the MJO envelope.</p><p>The complex movement of clouds within a cloud system can be used to identify if a merger is likely between clouds. A merged cloud could indicate more unstable weather. The merger and movement of such cloud clusters can also lead to high intensity rainfall events during the monsoon season. Techniques to track and visualize such cloud system interactions could therefore be effective for nowcasting, where using near-real time satellite data, merger and movement of cloud systems could be used for forecasting high intensity rainfall events.</p><p>Advent of better technology has affected in increasing the availability of high resolution data (spatial resolution ∼ 4 km and temporal resolution ∼ 30 mins). Therefore, the amount of data that is to be processed when considering even a short time period such as a single day is large. A query-driven visualization framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref> will therefore be useful for performing analysis and visualization on these datasets, which are both large and complex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Problem Statement</head><p>Given the infrared (IR) brightness temperatures over a particular region, clouds present in the atmosphere over that region are captured as sub-level sets of a given temperature threshold. These clouds are then tracked over time in order to study various phenomena. Existing methods that track movement of cloud clusters fail to capture local movement within such a system. Also, when using existing methods, in addition to the threshold required for identifying clouds, both the identification and tracking require the users to input additional parameters. The movement obtained is dependant on the value of these parameters. Eliminating these additional parameters will not only simplify the operations performed by the user, but will also help provide consistent results that can be reproduced. Tracking clouds at different thresholds convey different information about the phenomena being studied. It is therefore important to be able to efficiently track movement of clouds at various thresholds.</p><p>In addition to the computational effort required to process the large amount of data available, manual analysis of such data over long time periods without a priori knowledge of the system is not practical. This necessitates the development of tools to query and explore cloud movements using this data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Contributions</head><p>We use techniques from computational topology and computer vision to design a framework that allows users to interactively visualize and explore the movement of cloud systems at various scales in space and time. Our framework has the following capabilities:</p><p>1. Compute and explore clouds at different thresholds. This is accomplished using the split tree of the input at each time step.</p><p>2. Compute a good threshold range to identify clouds of interest. This is accomplished using the persistence diagram.</p><p>3. Visualize cloud movement at different level of detail -from its local intra cloud-cluster movement to long term inter-cloud system interactions. Local movement is tracked using an optical flow computation. The local movement together with the computed clouds is then used to compute a cloud motion graph, which tracks the interaction between clouds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Support queries on both the properties of individual clouds, as</head><p>well on their motion patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Support queries on entire cloud systems.</head><p>A precipitation distribution captures the amount of rainfall over that region at a given time. Since IR brightness temperature and precipitation are inversely related, by reversing the values of the precipitation of a region, we show that the same techniques used for IR brightness temperature works for this input as well. The production of such data includes additional information from microwave channels, which is absent in IR brightness temperatures, and hence a combination of these two datasets could lead to better tracking of multiple scale cloud systems. Finally, we show the utility of the developed framework through the following use case scenarios:</p><p>• Study and track the equatorial MJO over the Indian ocean.</p><p>• Study events that lead to intense rainfall over Mumbai, <ref type="bibr">India, in</ref> July 2005.</p><p>• Study the movement of clouds during the period that the tropical cyclone Aila made landfall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>We describe the related work in two categories -those related to feature tracking and visualization, and those related to the study of cloud systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Feature Tracking and Climate Visualization</head><p>Several efforts in the past use computational topology to identify and track features of a spatio-temporal input. Laney et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and later Bremer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> use the Morse decomposition to identify features of the input and track these features across time using the geometric properties of the features. Pascucci et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> identify features using merge trees, and track burning cells during turbulent combustion by computing the overlap of the features. Widanagamaachchi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> extend this technique and design a framework to explore time-varying data. Kasten et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> map critical points of the input scalar function across time steps and create a merge graph that is used to track unsteady flow fields. While these methods track the movement of features, they do not capture orthogonal movement that might be present within the feature. Directly related to this work, Gambheer and Bhat <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> track clouds by considering the overlap of sub-level sets across time steps. More recently, Fiolleau and Roca <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> consider the time varying two dimensional input as a three-dimensional volume, and track clouds by tracking seed points within this volume. In addition to the threshold used to identify clouds, these techniques also require users to specify other parameters as input. Again, these techniques while capturing cloud movement, miss any different movement that is present within cloud systems.</p><p>There has been some recent work on developing visualization frameworks for the exploration of climate and weather data. Lundblad <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> design a software for visualizing weather and ship data. Ladstädter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> design a framework to explore the variables of climate model data. Santos et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> propose a work flow based, provenance enabled system, called UV-CDAT, that integrates climate data analysis libraries and visualization tools into a single application. Work on visualizing clouds focus on accurately rendering clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no work that allows for exploring and querying patterns of cloud motion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Cloud Systems</head><p>Occurrence of an MJO is typically identified in a meteorological dataset by using the spectral analysis technique of Wheeler and Kiladis <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, which relates spatial frequency with spatial scale of the harmonic. A variable such as outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is generally averaged over a large latitudinal extent such as 15 • N-15 • S and space-time harmonic analysis conducted for the entire latitudinal belt. An MJO is identified if power exists at a global wave number of 3-5 and time-period corresponding to 40-50 days. Tracking of meridional oscillations on the intra-seasonal scale has been attempted by using continuous space-time wavelets and searching of significant energy on the spatial scale of 4000 km and a related peak in the 40-50 day scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. Neither of these bring out the rich structure of multi-scale interactions which our proposed framework attempts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">BACKGROUND</head><p>In this section, we briefly introduce the necessary background on techniques from computer vision and computational topology that form the mathematical and algorithmic basis of the proposed framework for visualizing and exploring cloud systems. Comprehensive discussions on these concepts is available in several textbooks <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Scalar functions and Level sets</head><p>A scalar function is a function that maps points in a spatial domain to the set of real values R. Scalar functions are used to represent temperature or precipitation data from satellite images or weather simulations.  The scalar function is typically represented using a structured grid G, together with a piecewise bilinear function f : G → R. The function is defined on the vertices of the grid and the function value at a point within a cell of the grid is computed using bilinear interpolation.</p><p>The preimage f −1 (a) of a real value a of a scalar function f is called a level set. It is the set of all points on the domain having function value equal to a. A sub-level set of a real value a is defined as the preimage of the interval (−∞, a]. It is the set of all points having function value less than or equal to a. Similarly, the super-level set of a is the preimage of the interval [a, +∞). The closed red and black curves in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>(a) denotes two level sets of the input function. The region inside these curves denote sub-level sets, while the region outside the curve denotes super-level sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Join tree and Split tree</head><p>Consider a sweep of the input function f in increasing order of function value. The nature of topological change to the sub-level sets of f when the sweep encounters a vertex determines the vertex type.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">The vertex is regular:</head><p>The topology of the sub-level sets do not change.</p><p>2. The vertex is a minimum: A new sub-level set component is created. The scalar function shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>(a) has three minima A,B, and C.</p><p>3. The vertex is a split saddle: Two sub-level set components merge into one. This is equivalent to one of the components being destroyed. The point D in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>(a) represents one such saddle where the sub-level set components created at minima A and C merge into one.</p><p>The split tree tracks the changes in the connectivity of sub-level sets of the input scalar function. Nodes of the split tree correspond to the set of minima and split saddles of f . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>(b) shows the split tree corresponding to the input function shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>(a).</p><p>The join tree of f is defined similarly, and tracks the connectivity of the super-level sets of f . Nodes of the join tree correspond to the set of maxima and join saddles of f . A maximum is a vertex where a new super-level set component is created during the sweep of the input in decreasing order of function value, and a join saddle is a vertex where two super-level set components merge into one.</p><p>A vertex that is not regular, such as a minimum or a saddle, is called critical. Efficient algorithms to compute join and split trees of an input scalar function can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. Regular vertices are often inserted into the join / split tree as degree-2 nodes to obtain an augmented join tree / augmented split tree. Clouds may be represented as sub-or super-level set components of an appropriate scalar function. The split and join tree help extract and analyse individual clouds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Topological persistence</head><p>Consider the sweep of the input function f in increasing order of function value. As mentioned above, the topology of the sub-level sets change when this sweep encounters a critical point. A critical point is called a creator if a new component is created and a destroyer otherwise. It turns out that one can pair up each creator v 1 uniquely with a destroyer v 2 that destroys the component created at v 1 . The persistence value of</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v 1 and v 2 is defined as f (v 2 ) − f (v 1 )</formula><p>, which is intuitively the lifetime of the feature created at v 1 , and is thus a measure of the importance of v 1 and v 2 . In this paper, we are only interested in the persistence of the set of minima or the set of maxima. For an appropriately chosen scalar function, the persistence is a measure of the size of the corresponding cloud. Given an input domain of size n, the persistence of such features can be computed efficiently in O(n log n + nα(n)) time using the union-find data structure, as compared to the cubic-time required by the algorithm to compute general topological persistence <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. The persistence diagram <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> plots the features of the input function as set of points on a 2D plane, where the x− and y−coordinates of a feature corresponds to its birth and death time respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Optical flow</head><p>Given a sequences of images over time, the optical flow is the apparent motion of the brightness patterns in the image <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. It is computed as a velocity field, which provides the velocity with which every pixel of an image moves. Studying the optical flow helps understand the motion of objects in the images. In the context of weather data, we aim to use it to understand the motion of features such as clouds. The basis of most optical flow computation algorithms is the assumption of brightness constancy, which states that when a pixel flows from one image to another, its intensity or colour does not change. Let I(x, y,t) denote the intensity of the pixel (x, y) at time t. Let the pixel have flow (u(x, y,t), v(x, y,t)). Then, the brightness constancy can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I(x, y,t) = I(x + u, y + v,t + 1).</formula><p>Linearizing by applying a first-order Taylor expansion to the right hand side yields the approximation</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">I(x, y,t) = I(x, y,t) + u δ I δ x + v δ I δ y + 1 δ I δt .</formula><p>This gives the optical flow constraint equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">u δ I δ x + v δ I δ y + 1 δ I δt = 0.</formula><p>Both the brightness constancy equation and the optical flow constraint equation provide just one constraint on two unknowns for each pixel. Algorithms computing the optical flow introduce additional constraints in order to solve the above equations. We refer the reader to multiple surveys on the topic for a comprehensive discussion of algorithms for computing the optical flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">TRACKING CLOUD MOVEMENT</head><p>Clouds are masses of condensed water vapor floating in the atmosphere. They are spatial features that evolve over time. This section describes methods for efficient identification of clouds and tracking of cloud movement based on techniques presented in the previous section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Identifying Clouds</head><p>Two scalar functions commonly used by climate scientists to study clouds are infrared (IR) brightness temperature and precipitation, respectively. The function is sampled on a grid representing the geographic region of interest. We now describe how a cloud is identified using these two functions. Clouds are extracted from both types of data using level set analysis. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">IR brightness temperature</head><p>The IR brightness temperature data that we use in this work is the CPC-merged dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This dataset has been prepared by merging pixel resolution IR brightness data from GOES/8/10, METEOSAT-7/5 and GMS geostationary satellites at a spatial resolution of 4km and temporal resolutions of 30 minutes. The data is available from February 2000 to present. This is a unique dataset that allows study of tropical systems such as Cyclone and Monsoons at multiple scales from the local cloud scale to the planetary scale with a single comprehensive dataset. Given the IR brightness temperature distribution, the set of clouds over the corresponding geographical region is identified as the collection of sub-level set components for a given temperature threshold t. Commonly used thresholds are approximately in the temperature range t ∈ <ref type="bibr">[192K, 235K]</ref>. The threshold values usually depend on whether the clouds of interest are tall or short. Colder temperatures (≤ 210K) indicate tall clouds with cloudtops at 7.5 km or higher and are associated with Cumulonimbus (Cb) cells, while higher temperatures indicate short clouds that are associated with Stratus clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. However, there is no single good value for t. We propose the use of the persistence diagram to identify the threshold of interest.</p><p>A cloud is represented by the smallest minimum contained in the corresponding sub-level set component. We generate the persistence diagram of the set of all minima of the IR brightness temperature. The persistence of a cloud is represented in the persistence diagram as the height of the corresponding point above the x = y line. Clouds of interest often correspond to high persistent features. The persistence diagram helps locate highly persistent minima whose temperature lie within a larger feasible interval of values. The search space for the threshold is now reduced to the smaller temperature range containing these minima. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows the persistence diagram for the input shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>(a). The most prominent clouds correspond to those formed in the threshold range <ref type="bibr">[200K, 210K]</ref>. This is also validated by the fact that there are no new significant clouds in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>(c), which was generated using a higher threshold of 235K.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Precipitation</head><p>While IR brightness temperature is a continuous function, precipitation is more discrete (zero or non-zero) in nature. Additionally using only IR brightness temperature could have problems in separating high level cirrus from tall Cb clouds. However, the use of precipitation data in combination with the IR brightness temperatures could differenti- ate between tall Cb clouds which precipitate, and cirrus clouds (in the form of an anvil to tall Cb clouds) which could have low IR temperature but would not precipitate.</p><p>We use the 3B42 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> in our experiments, which combines data from TRMM precipitation radar, TRMM microwave image and infrared scanner merged with IR brightness from geostationary satellites. It has a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees (approximately corresponding to 25 km in the deep tropics). The temporal resolution is 3 hours. This dataset spans December 1997 -present and is one of the widely used datasets for studying tropical convection at various temporal and spatial scales ranging from comparison with modelling studies at monthly scale to obtaining diurnal signatures of rainfall. More details about the creation of this dataset can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</p><p>When using precipitation as input, a higher value of precipitation corresponds to tall clouds since Cb cells are likely to produce more rain than stratus. Given the precipitation over a geographical region of interest, the set of clouds is computed as the collection of superlevel sets for a given precipitation threshold p. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5(a)</ref> shows the precipitation of the same region over the east coast of India as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figures 5(b)</ref> and 5(c) show the set of clouds obtained using two different thresholds. We again use the persistence diagram of the set of maxima of the precipitation to identify an appropriate threshold and compute the clouds of interest. Unless otherwise specified, the examples in the remainder of this paper use IR brightness temperature as their input scalar function. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Tracking cloud movement</head><p>Climate scientists are often interested in studying the temporal properties of a cloud system such as its origin, how it interacts with other clouds, and its movement. Given the set of clouds at two consecutive time steps, we track the movement of clouds using the optical flow between the pair of IR brightness temperature images. In particular, our software uses an implementation of the Farneback algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> provided by OpenCV <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3(d)</ref> shows the velocity field for a time-step obtained using this algorithm. The advantage of using optical flow is two-fold: 1) by not explicitly representing each cloud with a single point, it captures intra-cloud system movements that are missed by existing methods, and 2) it results in a time-varying vector field that captures the smooth local motion of the clouds. As we show later in Section 6, the local motion can help visualize the cloud movement and, more importantly, it can also be used as a powerful tool for querying and identifying interesting patterns in cloud movements. The velocity field obtained as the output of the optical flow algorithm is used to construct a cloud motion graph, that maps clouds from one time step to clouds in the next time step. This graph captures the movement and interaction between clouds over time. It essentially captures when clouds originate, how they merge and split with other clouds, and when they cease to exist. We use this graph to obtain a higher level representation of the cloud system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">VISUALIZATION OF CLOUD SYSTEMS</head><p>We now describe our software framework which allows users to explore and visualize the movement of cloud systems. For ease of explanation, we assume the input function is specified as IR brightness temperatures. Note that the same techniques described below will work for a precipitation input by reversing the function values. Also note that in order to use this system, users do not require knowledge of the underlying representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Exploring the data</head><p>Given the input data for different time steps, we first compute the set of clouds at each time step. We then compute the optical flow between consecutive time steps, and use the obtained velocity field to construct the cloud motion graph. The different data structures present in our framework can be used to support various queries over the given input. We now describe the different ways in which users can explore the input data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Explore different thresholds</head><p>As mentioned in Section 4.1, there is no universally correct threshold to be used. Depending on the goal, climate scientists use different thresholds to identify clouds. Without a priori knowledge of the system being studied, a trial and error method to obtain the right threshold becomes very cumbersome. While using the persistence diagram helps narrow this search space, computing the clouds at different possible thresholds is still computationally expensive. Moreover, since the search space is continuous, there are theoretically infinite possible thresholds that can be used.</p><p>The split tree (Section 3.2) captures threshold ranges in which there is no change to the structure of a cloud. If we order the critical points in increasing order of function value, then there is no topological change in the structure of clouds between the function values corresponding to two consecutive critical points. This provides a way to discretize the search space. Also, by storing the augmented split tree it is easy to recover the clouds at a threshold t ± ε given the set of clouds at t by moving up / down the arcs of the split tree.</p><p>We therefore first compute the set of split trees for the given input, and use this as a data structure to identify clouds. In addition to providing a set of discrete function intervals that the users might be interested in, the split tree also allows us to efficiently compute clouds with changing threshold values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Query the input</head><p>Both the velocity field obtained from the optical flow algorithm, and the cloud motion graph encode information about the motion of cloud systems. This enables us to support queries on the input, which greatly eases the effort of users to find patterns in cloud movements. Our framework supports queries on individual clouds as well as on cloud systems. The different queries supported by our system with respect to individual clouds are:</p><p>1. Query clouds based on direction of movement. Users are often interested in finding clouds that move in certain directions. Using the optical flow, we allow users to search for clouds that move in the four principal directions, i.e. north, south, east, and west.</p><p>2. Query clouds based on its longevity. This allows users to identify clouds that are alive for a given duration. The lifetime of a cloud is measured similar to persistence, based on its mergers and splits over time.</p><p>3. Query clouds based on its size. The user can view only those clouds that have a given size. While we currently use the area of the cloud as a measure of its size, it can be easily extended to support other measures of size as well. 4. Query clouds based on its velocity. Knowing the rate at which clouds are moving, wind patterns can be estimated (generally known as Cloud Motion Vectors).</p><p>We also support queries based on movement, lifetime, size and velocity of cloud systems, which are represented as connected components of the cloud motion graph. In addition to this, we also support the queries on cloud systems based on their behaviour over time. An example of such query is when a user wants to identify cloud systems which is involved in a lot of merge / split activity between clouds. If two cloud systems merge, they are likely to form bigger systems which could result in higher rainfall / more unstable weather. Conversely splitting and moving away could indicate weakening of the system. Our system also supports temporal queries, which the user can use to find time intervals that contain clouds or cloud systems having any of the above given properties.</p><p>In addition to the above queries on the movement of clouds, we also support queries to gather various statistics of the cloud system such as the area covered by the clouds and the frequency distribution of cloud heights. The latter is particularly of interest for climate scientists. The change in such a frequency distribution within a cloud system could indicate whether the cloud system is intensifying (having more taller clouds) or decaying (having less taller clouds). If multiple cloud systems with tall clouds are seen in a region, then more unsettled weather is highly likely over that region. One can also get an overview of the frequency distribution of cloud heights using the persistence diagram. Thus, such queries can be used as a now-casting tool.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Visualizing cloud movement</head><p>In addition to exploring the data, our framework also supports visualizing the interactions between clouds and their movement. We provide three ways in which this movement of clouds can be visualized -(a) by showing inter-cloud interactions, (b) by showing local movement of select clouds, and (c) by showing long term movement of select clouds. We now describe each of these visualizations in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">Cloud interactions</head><p>Users are interested in understanding how clouds interact with each other over time. In particular, they are interested in identifying clouds that belong to the same cloud system. Such interactions are captured by the connected components of the cloud motion graph, which represents the set of cloud systems. Let the edges of this graph be directed towards nodes having a later time step. Then, a node having more than one incoming edge would correspond to multiple clouds merging into a single cloud, while a node having multiple outgoing edges would correspond to a cloud splitting to multiple clouds.</p><p>In order to show such interaction between clouds, we assign a unique colour to clouds that belong to a common component. Thus, when the user selects a time step, clouds having the same colour would correspond to those within a cloud system. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>(a) shows clusters of clouds at a particular time step. Clusters are determined by the cloud interactions either in the past or in future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">Local cloud movement</head><p>The intra-cloud system movement can easily be overlooked when viewing an animation of the cloud system movements. This is especially true for potentially interesting short term movements which could identify interesting phenomena. Climate scientists are therefore interested in viewing such intra-cloud system movement of a cloud of interest as a static image. The velocity field obtained using the optical flow algorithm, which tracks the motion of individual pixels forming a cloud, may be processed to identify the intra-cloud system interactions.</p><p>We use the streak lines of the computed velocity field to visualize such movement. The user first selects a cloud of interest at a particular time step. We then sample points within this cloud depending on the required density specified by the user. Using the sampled points as seed points, we compute and display the streak lines. Climate scientists also want to differentiate between the history and future of these trajectories. We therefore colour code the streak lines depending on the time step of the selected cloud. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6(b)</ref> shows the local movement of one such cloud. With respect to the time step of the selected cloud, the past movement of the cloud is represented using a red trajectory, while the future movement is represented using a yellow trajectory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.3">Long term cloud movement</head><p>Users are also interested in viewing the long term movement of clouds in a single frame, rather than keeping track of the clouds by either explicitly changing time steps, or through an animation of their movement. In addition to the long term direction of movement, they are also interested in tracking the size of the clouds over time, since this provides a sense of whether the cloud system is growing or decaying over time.</p><p>As mentioned in Section 4.2, this movement is stored in the cloud motion graph. When the user selects a cloud of interest, we trace the evolution of that cloud as a set of nodes in the cloud motion graph. A  uniform sample of the time steps are then selected. The clouds corresponding to the nodes in these time steps are then displayed so that the change of size over time can be visualized. In order to differentiate between the different time steps, the clouds are colour coded over time. Note that having a dense sampling of time steps could clutter the visualization. In addition to displaying the clouds, the general direction of movement is also displayed as a glyph. This direction is computed as the vector that transforms the center of the cloud system from one time step to the next. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>(c) shows the long term movement of the green cloud in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>(a).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">USE CASE SCENARIOS</head><p>In this section, we demonstrate the utility of our framework through three use case scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Implementation and Experimental Setup</head><p>We first describe the implementation of our prototype software and the experimental setup. Experiments are performed on the CPC-merged dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The data is available as a set of 62 MB binary files, where each file stores the data for the two 30 minute intervals within the corresponding hour. We first crop the data based on the given time period and the spatial range of interest. We then pre-process this input in order to support interactive exploration and visualization. Preprocessing includes computing and storing the split trees for the different time periods. We also compute the birth temperature, death temperature, and persistence of various clouds when computing the split tree. The optical flow associated with each time step is also stored while pre-processing the input.</p><p>Our software then uses the stored split trees and optical flow to compute the set of clouds and the cloud motion graph using the threshold specified by the user. The software allows the user to view the movement of clouds as an animation. Alternatively, the user can view a specific time instant. The software also allows the selection of clouds of interest in order to view either the local or long term movement of the clouds. The user can also specify the density of sampling and the density of time intervals that are used to generate the resultant visualizations. The visualizations are generated using the pre-computed data structures, which are small compared to the entire input data. Also, given a time step of interest, we load only the data corresponding to neighbouring time steps into memory. This helps reduce the memory overhead and hence the software can handle very large time periods.</p><p>In our current implementation, querying of cloud systems is supported via a command interface. Querying is currently performed using a brute-force search. Due to this, queries over a large time range (typically greater than two weeks) requires time in the order of minutes to finish. Adding specialized data structures would potentially improve the querying time. In all the reported experiments, no filter corresponding to the size or lifetime of the clouds were applied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Analysis of movement of the equatorial MJO over Indian Ocean</head><p>Nakazawa <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> used 3-hourly IR data and showed that within the intraseasonal Madden Julian Oscillation there exists super cloud clusters of spatial size of thousands of kilometres moving eastward at 10-15 ms −1 and had a time scale of less than 10 days. Embedded inside these were cloud clusters of 100 kms and time scale 1-2 days moving westwards. We could verify the existence of such cloud clusters over the Indonesian region using our framework. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref> shows the local movement of a couple of selected clouds of the MJO on 2 January 2007, which shows a general westward movement of the cloud clusters. The eastern movement of the super cloud clusters was speculated to be due to the successive cloud cluster formation east of an older one, leading to an overall eastward propagation. Since the actual clouds move westwards, identifying the eastward propagation of the westward moving clouds would normally require the user to manually analyse cloud movements over a longer time period. Also, such analysis would only provide qualitative verification of the phenomena. Using our query framework it is possible to obtain a quantitative verification of such phenomena as follows.</p><p>The idea behind the following experiment is to study the concentration of west moving clouds over a long time interval. We first query for the set of west moving cloud systems at regular intervals in time. We used an interval range of 6 hours in our experiment. We then use the geometric centre of all the clouds of the obtained cloud system to approximate the concentration of the west moving clouds. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref> plots the longitude of these centres at different times. Note that initially, the concentration of west moving clouds also moves westward. Then, as a new set of west moving clouds are formed to the east of existing cloud clusters, the cloud concentration begins to move eastward until the new cloud clusters are fully formed. As these newly formed clouds moves westward, the cloud concentration again moves to the west. The above process keeps repeating with every new cloud cluster that is formed to the east, which implies a gradual eastward motion of the MJO. The plot also indicates the time scale of the west moving cloud clusters, the time between the formation of one cloud cluster and the next, to be around 1-2 days.</p><p>While the expected movement of clouds within these cloud clusters is in a westward direction, it is also possible that there are exceptions, wherein there is an occasional short term eastward movement due to a convectively coupled kelvin wave <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Manually searching for such possibilities is difficult. It is also possible that only parts of a large cloud moves eastward. In addition to the size of such east moving clouds being small, the duration of this eastward movement is short. It is therefore possible to miss such movement through manual analysis. Using our framework, we query the input for clouds that move eastward. The result of this query is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, which shows the eastern moving clouds for one time step. Our analysis indicates the asymmetry of the embedded cloud clusters. Westward moving clusters are more and of longer duration while eastward moving clusters are of shorter duration and fewer. Further it indicates that MJO are a multi-scale phenomena with each scale having a characteristic signature, that is, a larger scale envelope that gives the eastward moving MJO and shorter scale cloud clusters that move westward within the envelope. These short term westward moving cloud clusters in turn contain smaller clouds that move eastward. Our analysis also indicates that the movement of envelope is associated with an eastward movement of the position of genesis of westward moving cloud clusters. This insight has been easily obtained from our present analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">2005 Mumbai Rainfall</head><p>The heavy rainfall event at Mumbai (Bombay), India was of unprecedented intensity. It occured on 26-27 July 2005. It was a highly lo-calized event with Santa Cruz (Mumbai Airport) receiving 94.4 cm of rainfall within 24 hours. In constrast, Colaba in South Mumbai received a scant 7.3 cm during the same period. Most of the 94 cms fell within a few hours. If we examine the large-scale features we note that prior to this event, monsoon was in an inactive phase from 19-22 July 2005. On 23 July a low pressure area formed over Northern Bay of Bengal, intensified into a well-marked low, and moved westward <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">(Figure 10(b)</ref>) show that the large cloud is moving from the west towards Mumbai. On the other hand, the smaller cloud was formed over Mumbai, and it moves west towards the Arabian sea. Looking at the long term movement in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 10(c)</ref> shows that the larger cloud has travelled across the breadth of India after originating in the region east of West Bengal. This cloud then splits into two, one part moving in the north west direction, while the other merges with the small cloud that has formed over Mumbai. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 11</ref> shows the persistence diagram corresponding to this input. Note that the presence of high persistence clouds that were created in the threshold range [215K,225K] suggests using a high threshold. We therefore use a threshold of 220K. The validity of the range suggested was also verified using a lower threshold of 210K. In this experiment, we couldn't capture the merger between the large west moving cloud and small cloud that was born over Mumbai.</p><p>The use of higher threshold to capture high rainfall around Mumbai could be related to the fact that quite a bit of rainfall are orography related. That is, when moist flow faces an obstruction such as the Western Ghats, copious rainfall can occur even with relatively shorter clouds. Mahani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> have also commented on the problems related close to regions of high orography.</p><p>The breaking of the MCS with a part going north-westward and another part moving towards Mumbai has not been documented in the previous study of Sahaney et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. They used conventional methods of manually tracking low pressure systems <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref> in their paper).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Cyclone Aila</head><p>One generally reads only about the movement of the entire cyclonic system. In this use case, we show the rich structure of cloud movements within a cyclone whose motion could be very different from that of the larger envelope, which in this case is the cyclone. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> shows the movement of clouds when cyclone Aila made landfall on May 2009. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12(b)</ref> shows the local movement of the cloud corresponding to the eye of the cyclone, which indicates a spiral pattern. The long term movement, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>(c) of this cloud system corresponds to a movement towards West Bengal. Note that the cloud splits after landfall.</p><p>This again shows the occurrence of multi-scale interactions, the smaller cloud systems embedded in the larger scale cyclone with differing life cycles and direction of movement. While the splitting of the system is mentioned in the IMD report <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, no supporting satellite pictures are shown. Our framework easily tracks this splitting of the system. Such a split in the cloud, which results in the split clouds moving away from each other, indicates that the system is likely to weaken. Such observations from real time data could again be used for now-casting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we proposed a framework to identify and explore cloud systems. It uses techniques from computational topology to efficiently identify clouds at different thresholds. The motion of clouds are then tracked using optical flow. Our framework allows for various queries on cloud systems that helps to easily and effectively analyse cloud systems without any knowledge of the underlying techniques.</p><p>Our framework clearly brings out that most tropical convective phenomena such as the Madden Julian Oscillation and tropical cyclone are multi-scale phenomena with smaller scale cloud systems embedded in the larger envelope. The movement of the envelope could be very different from that of the individual cloud systems. For MJO, our method clearly brings out that the envelope moves eastward due to the eastward movement of the genesis region of westward moving cloud clusters. Multiple cloud systems over a region could indicate severe weather while splitting of a convective system and their drifting away could indicate weakening of the larger system. These indicate that our framework has potential as a now-casting tool. We intend to release this framework for use by meteorologists and climate scientists to facilitate their study of cloud systems.</p><p>Currently, the cloud motion graph is used only for supporting queries. In future, we intend to use it as a user interface to interact with the visualization system. Additional visualizations of the calculated statistics such as distribution of cloud sizes could help guide users to explore the data. While queries on the input are processed quickly for smaller time intervals, this is not true when the data is available over large time periods. It will be interesting to consider indexing data structures to support interactive querying over large data sets. A web based interface for the framework that accesses real-time data will help complement existing now-casting tools.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 (</head><label>2</label><figDesc>a) shows an example of a scalar function defined on a plane.
