				<p>Fig. 1. Incorrect vessel segmentations (left) can by modified interactively in high quality by our algorithm (center left). An annotation mechanism for inflows and outflows allows the creation of models suitable for computational hemodynamics (center right, right) Abstract-The precise modeling of vascular structures plays a key role in medical imaging applications, such as diagnosis, therapy planning and blood flow simulations. For the simulation of blood flow in particular, high-precision models are required to produce accurate results. It is thus common practice to perform extensive manual data polishing on vascular segmentations prior to simulation. This usually involves a complex tool chain which is highly impractical for clinical on-site application. To close this gap in current blood flow simulation pipelines, we present a novel technique for interactive vascular modeling which is based on implicit sweep surfaces. Our method is able to generate and correct smooth high-quality models based on geometric centerline descriptions on the fly. It supports complex vascular free-form contours and consequently allows for an accurate and fast modeling of pathological structures such as aneurysms or stenoses. We extend the concept of implicit sweep surfaces to achieve increased robustness and applicability as required in the medical field. We finally compare our method to existing techniques and provide case studies that confirm its contribution to current simulation pipelines.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Patient-specific models of vascular structures are an important foundation of many clinical applications. Due to their complex morphology and their vital function, vessels are of particular importance when assessing risks or evaluating different surgical strategies. The simulation of blood flows (computational hemodynamics), for instance, is an important new field in medical imaging. The basic idea is to avoid the risks of invasive measurements by using vessel segmentations as a basis to simulate quantifiable patient-specific blood flows. These simulations can then, for instance, be used to compute and visualize wall shear stress gradients, fractional flow reserve (FFR) statistics or intra-aneurysmal flow patterns.</p><p>To perform reliable simulations, accurate vascular models are of utmost importance. In pathological cases, such as stenoses or aneurysms in particular, expressive modeling techniques are required to capture the patient-specific vascular geometry. Automatic vessel segmentation is a traditional field in medical imaging and a huge variety of methods has been developed over the last decades. However, none of these methods can guarantee a perfect segmentation in all scenarios. Pathological cases in particular tend to pose problems even for state-of-the-art vessel segmentation algorithms. A manual inspection of automatically generated segmentations is thus usually inevitable before performing computational hemodynamics. In case of deficiencies, a common approach is to run segmentations again with a changed parameter set that hopefully leads to improved results. Another approach is to export data to generic geometric modeling tools where trained profesionals perform plausible corrections <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>. This workflow is impractical for every day's clinical routine as it requires significant geometric modeling skills and involves complex tools.</p><p>To solve this problem, we present an image-independent vascular modeling technique. Our method allows to generate high-quality vascular models from automatic segmentations and provides facilities to interactively correct those models in an integrated intuitive workflow. We model individual vascular branches using implicit sweep surfaces and smoothly blend them at furcations. To avoid bulging, we use a recently published gradient-based blending operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, which perfectly suits our vascular application. We furthermore present an extended interpolation technique that significantly contributes to the robustness of implicit sweep surfaces for challenging datasets. To generate data which is directly suited for simulation frameworks, we propose an automatic inflow and outflow annotation technique which allows for easy user manipulations. We validate our method by evaluating its accuracy on a broad set of medical data sets, ranging from manually annotated coronary arteries to automatically segmented centerline descriptions for whole-body arterial trees. In addition, we compare our method to existing approaches and present case studies, which confirm its contribution to the computational hemodynamics pipeline.</p><p>Our method is based on geometric centerline descriptions since they provide a natural way to represent the topology of tubular structures and an excellent basis for navigation during user interactions. In this article, we presuppose the presence of a centerline description for a given vessel tree. The tree may contain automatically segmented cross-sectional contours, as they are generated by geometric segmen-tation algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49]</ref>. If the centerline tree contains no cross sections, surface models can be created from scratch manually.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Vascular modeling is a vast field in medical imaging and many different techniques have been proposed to generate models for various applications. In this section we will first review existing vascular modeling techniques and their individual properties. Since our method is based on implicit sweep surfaces, we will then give a brief introduction on implicit modeling and a short overview of the history of sweepbased modeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Vascular Modeling</head><p>Current vascular modeling methods can roughly be categorized to be either model-based or model-free. In this section we will first review the most important model-free approaches before giving a brief overview of model-based techniques. Extensive summaries on the topic can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50]</ref>.</p><p>Model-free methods are also referred to as implicit methods, since they usually rely on generic point cloud-based interpolation techniques and make extensive use of implicit indicator functions to interpolate models. Common choices for interpolation techniques include multilevel partition of unity implicits <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> and Poisson surface reconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>. Model-free methods are usually concerned with a robust extraction of point clouds from binary segmentation masks that is able to capture fine vessels. To generate reliable interpolations, these methods need a dense sampling and they do usually not incorporate explicit topological and geometric information on the underlying vasculature.</p><p>Model-based methods, in contrast, are motivated by the tubular structure of vascular systems and are frequently used to visualize centerline descriptions. Many techniques rely on explicit mesh generation methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52]</ref>, which is usually fast but often leads to selfintersecting meshes at vascular furcations. For computational hemodynamics, the generated models need to be smooth and free of selfintersections or unwanted inner structures. Implicit modeling provides inherent composition mechanisms to solve this problem and has been successfully used to generate model-based vascular models. An early approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> was based on convolution surfaces and produces closed, intersection-free models. It has, however, limited expressiveness, since it is restricted to polar definitions of cross sections. An implicit modeling technique that supports free-form shapes was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. The segment-based modeling paradigm, however, leads to C 0 continuous models only, which are inadequate for simulation purposes or virtual angioscopy applications. Sweep surfaces have recently been employed <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> to model vascular trees using piecewise algebraic splines with excellent smoothness properties. The authors, however, report reconstruction times of 1-3 minutes for an optimized GPU implementation, which prohibits interactive applications.</p><p>Workflows to interactively segment or correct vascular segmentations have been proposed previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47]</ref>. These semi-automatic methods, however, are bound to the resolution of the underlying dataset and allow only for an indirect manipulation of the vascular representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Implicit Modeling</head><p>Implicit indicator functions are a compact natural way to describe the volume and the surface of an object in a scalar field d(x) : R 3 → R. Even though implicit representations do not contain an inherent parameterization of the volume like polycube-based models <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>, their simplicity has made them a widely used tool in geometric modeling. For signed indicator functions, the surface of the object is usually defined by the zero level set d(x) = 0, the interior of the object is defined by d(x) &lt; 0 and the exterior satisfies</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">d(x) &gt; 0 d(x) =    &lt; 0 if x inside ob ject 0 if x on ob ject boundary &gt; 0 if x outside ob ject .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Implicit modeling is motivated by the fact that signed indicator functions can easily be combined using Boolean operators such as min and max to form unions, intersections and subtractions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>. The result of combining two signed indicator functions is, again, a signed indicator function which allows a recursive application of operators to compose complex objects. This process is commonly referred to as solid modeling and is strikingly easy to apply. One drawback, however, is that min and max operators only preserve C 0 continuity, which leads to undesirable sharp edges at object joints (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>, left).</p><p>To create smooth blends of objects, the closely related concept of potential field modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> can be applied. The original concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> was physically motivated and focused on point primitives emitting a potential field. In contrast to distance fields, whose magnitudes continuously increases with larger distance to the surface, potential fields are usually designed to drop to zero at a certain distance from the object boundary. A blending operation is required to be neutral if one of the operands is zero. This leads to a locally constrained influence since far-away regions of an object description are neutral during blending. For comprehensive overviews on implicit modeling see Wyvill <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>, Bloomenthal <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and Frisken <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>An inherent property of potential field modeling is that bulges emerge when overlapping potential fields are blended. In some cases these bulges are desirable (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>, right) but in general they are considered a problem and several strategies have been proposed to suppress them. One strategy is to offset the blended objects to reduce overlap while maintaining the desired overall shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. This technique, however, was developed for convolution surfaces with circular cross-sectional shapes and reasonable offsets are hard to guess in our case. Another strategy is to narrow the potential field <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36]</ref>. This, however, results in reduced smoothness properties of the resulting blends. The key observation is that bulges are both a blessing and a curse in potential field modeling and that they have to be treated carefully in an application like vascular modeling.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>). Sharp joints emerge. Right: The corresponding potential fields are blended using summation. Joints are smooth, but bulges emerge (solid union is overlaid as reference).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Sweep Objects</head><p>Sweep objects are generally defined as the shapes which emerge when an object is moved along a trajectory. There are two basic related areas of research: sweep volumes treat the movement of three-dimensional objects through space while sweep surfaces are commonly used to refer to two-dimensional shapes swept along a trajectory.</p><p>Sweep volumes are largely used to describe tool paths in numerically controlled milling <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>. In such applications, Jacobi rank deficiency-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and sweep envelope differential equation-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> are frequently used to compute boundary representations of the resulting sweep. These methods are, however, computationally expensive and require the presence of closed-form boundary representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> has shown that volume sweeps of polyhedral models can be approximated efficiently by exploiting the fact that in this case only ruled (or developable) surface boundaries are present.</p><p>The cross-sectional information in a vascular centerline tree leads to two-dimensional shapes associated with the centerline. Our method can thus be categorized as a sweep surface method. Early appearances of sweep surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46]</ref> described only basic translational, rotational and conic sweeps. The concept was later generalized to curved trajectories with profile curves that vary the size of the contour as it moves along the trajectory <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37]</ref>. Most of these methods focus on an immediate tessellation of the resulting sweeps in the parameter domain. In this case, the prominent problem is that depending on the trajectory and the shape templates self-intersections frequently occur. Fortunately, implicit surface descriptions allow for volumetric Boolean operations, like unions or intersections, to be performed trivially. This property was exploited to inherently remove any selfintersections by using implicit functions as sweep templates <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41]</ref>. Crespin and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> analytically describe two-dimensional distance fields which can be varied along the trajectory. Their use of an (anisotropic) polar definition, however, restricts the resulting sweeps to star-shaped templates. Schmidt and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> further generalized sweep surfaces by generating generic signed distance fields which are blended along the trajectory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Implicit Representations for Polygons</head><p>To create implicit sweep surfaces from geometric centerline descriptions, some method is required to convert consecutive point lists sampled from the vascular wall into signed implicit descriptions. A wellknown approach is variational interpolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. By solving a linear system of equations, coefficients for a set of radial basis functions are computed, which interpolate prescribed values at certain constrained positions. To achieve an interpolation, which is negative inside S i and positive outside of S i , additional interior and exterior constraints with negative and positive interpolation values respectively have to be placed <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. This is commonly done at a small offset of the interpolation constraints in a direction normal to the surface. While this method is broadly applied as it is straightforward to implement and proven to deliver smooth results, it has several drawbacks. Depending on the support of the chosen basis functions a more or less dense linear system has to be solved for every outline in the vascular model. When dealing with complex outlines, the placement of the interior and exterior constraints has a strong effect on the resulting interpolation. Disadvantageously placed constraints may even result in unusable interpolations. Additionally, the interpolated scalar field massively differs from a signed distance function if it is only constrained in the vicinity of the object's surface. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> a hybrid approach is presented, which uses an unsigned Euclidean distance transform <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, to generate additional constraints for the variational interpolation setup. This stabilizes the variational solution and increases the similarity to a signed distance function, but comes at the cost of additional constraints.</p><p>Another approach is to construct 2D piecewise algebraic splines <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> which have been successfully used to model vascular trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. This method directly incorporates a smoothness parameter σ and directly produces blendable potential fields of arbitrary continuity. For increased smoothness parameters, however, the potential fields become approximating and do not interpolate the original polygon. In our scenario with closed outlines, this approximating behavior leads to a noticeable shrinkage. Moreover the evaluation of the implicit piecewise algebraic splines is rather expensive even for quadratic splines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">SWEEP SURFACES FOR VASCULAR MODELING</head><p>Implicit sweep primitives are defined by a sweep template and a trajectory along which the template is moved. In our scenario the sweep trajectory corresponds to the centerline of an unbranched vascular segment and is described by a list of consecutive nodes F i which follow the center of the vessel. The corresponding implicit vascular contours O i are represented by lists of consecutive coplanar points (o 0 i . . . o n i ) which sample the vascular surface in the corresponding plane P i and define a closed polygon.</p><p>To create an implicit description of a vascular tree, we essentially perform three steps: first we need to convert all vascular contours O i into implicit 2D sweep templates T i <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. We then use the centerline to compute the sweep surface for each branch (2). Finally, the branches are smoothly blended together to form the whole vascular tree (3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Implicit Sweep Templates</head><p>Several methods have been proposed to generate implicit descriptions from polygons. Since our method is specifically designed to allow interactive real-time applications, we chose to precompute rasterized implicit representations. During evaluation of the implicit sweep, the precomputed images serve as implicit sweep templates, which means, distance computations in the template domain are simple and efficient image lookups. This can be viewed as a caching strategy as opposed to the in-place evaluations used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> which result in a significantly higher computational complexity. To reduce aliasing, we use standard bilinear filtering when accessing the template images.</p><p>Catmull-Rom splines (CR splines) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> constitute a popular family of hermite cubic interpolants. We will employ CR splines for several interpolation tasks in this article since they are very easy to construct and expose local control and C 1 continuity. A CR spline that interpolates a list of consecutive points p i , i = 0 . . . n with varying distances is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">CR τ p i (t) =    1 u u 2 u 3    T    0 1 0 0 −τ 0 τ 0 2τ τ − 3 3 − 2τ −τ −τ 2 − τ τ − 2 τ       p i−1 p i p i+1 p i+2    u = t−t i t i+1 −t i (2) where t i = t i−1 + |p i − p i−1 |</formula><p>and t 0 = 0 represent the parameter values of the spline associated with the interpolated points p i . For every interval [t i ,t i+1 ], the spline is defined by a local cubic Bezier curve starting at p i and ending at p i+1 . The user-adjustable parameter τ ∈ [0, 1] accounts for the so-called 'tension' which means it determines how 'curved' the spline is.</p><p>To efficiently generate shape templates, we first construct a closed CR spline CR 0.7 O i (t) that interpolates the contour samples O i . To convert this parametric curve to an implicit description, we adaptively subdivide the spline and rasterize the resulting polygon to an image of adjustable resolution. We then perform an unsigned distance transform algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> which results in a discrete distance field. To convert it to a signed distance field, we use a modified scan line algorithm that uses the subdivided polygon to flip the sign of the distance values inside the object. This is essentially a point-in-polygon test. This method (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>), is very fast and the quality of the resulting distance fields is mainly determined by the choice of the distance transform algorithm and the resolution of the rasterization. The discrete distance templates generated by this approach are clamped, but since we are mostly interested in the surface and in the interior of the final sweep, far-away regions of the distance field are irrelevant. To increase performance, the generation of the templates can easily be parallelized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Defining the Implicit Sweep</head><p>In this section we will describe how to compute an implicit indicator function B(P) from a centerline trajectory with associated sweep templates. The surface of a branch will be described by the zero level set B(P) = 0 and the interior of the vessel by negative regions with B(p) &lt; 0. Let F : R → R 3 be a smooth parametric curve that interpolates the sampled centerline positions F i at parameter values t i</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">F(t) = ( f x (t), f y (t), f z (t)).<label>(3)</label></formula><p>To define the vascular sweep surface, an affine mapping W :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">R 3 → R 3</formula><p>is needed that transforms positions from the parameter domain of the curve to the embedding space and vice versa. We will from now on refer to the setting in the parameter domain as tangent space and denote the embedding space as world space as depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. A <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. Illustration of the corresponding world space and tangent space settings of a sweep. The mapping W is defined by the orthonormal frames (F t , F n , F b ). For curved trajectories, W −1 is ambiguous since world space positions can be mapped to multiple tangent space positions.</p><p>common way to define the tangent space is to use Frenet frames which define an orthonormal basis for any curve parameter t</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">F t (t) = F ′ (t) F ′ (t) F n (t) = F ′′ (t) F ′′ (t) F b (t) = F t (t) × F n (t)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where F t is the tangent function and the normal function F n and the binormal function F b parameterize a plane which is orthogonal to the centerline. To overcome singularities at inflection points F ′′ (t) = 0 several methods have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The basis defined by F t , F n and F b allows to define the mapping W which transforms tangent space points P ′ = (P t , P n , P b ) to world space points P = (P x , P y , P z ) for any given curve parameter t.</p><p>(P x , P y , P z ) = W t (P t , P n , P b ) = F(P t ) + P n * F n (P t )</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">+ P b * F b (P t )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>To describe curved centerlines, we define F(t) using a CR spline CR 0.7 F i (t) which interpolates the discrete centerline positions F i . Unfortunately, due to the bending induced by curved centerlines, the reverse mapping W −1 from world space to tangent space is ambiguous. Any world space position may be mapped to multiple positions in the tangent space as depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. Intuitively, this means, that depending on the curvature of the trajectory and the extent of the templates, local self-intersections may occur. Since our sweep is defined implicitly, however, we can resolve these intersections in-place by successively applying a Boolean union operator. For this, we use the quadratic polynomial operator described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> which is a smooth generalization of the min <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> operator and preserves the C 1 continuity of our CR spline-based interpolations.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">min li (x, y) = 1 2 (x + y − |x − y| 2,σ )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where |x| 2,σ is a smooth quadric approximation of the absolute function |x| with blend range σ</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">|x| 2,σ = |x|, |x| &gt; 2 x 2 (1 − 1 4 |x|), |x| ≤ 2<label>(7)</label></formula><p>To prevent an unwanted self-blending for a branch, we have to choose the blend range of the operator to be very narrow. In practice, it should be chosen to be a fraction of the smallest vessel radius, that is present in the dataset. This means min li behaves much like a solid union operator, but has the theoretical property of preserving C 1 continuity.</p><p>To determine W −1 for a point P in world space, all parameter values t that allow a projection of P to F(t) in the plane defined by F t (t), have to be determined. The reverse mapping W −1 thus looks as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">W −1 (P x , P y , P z ) = W −1 t (P x , P y , P z ) ((P x , P y , P z ) − F(t)) • F t (t) = 0 .<label>(8)</label></formula><p>The computation of the projectable parameters t depends on the degrees of the polynomials used to describe F and F t . For cubic polynomial interpolations, as in our case, the roots of a polynomial of degree 5 have to be computed numerically <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. This root-finding has to be performed individually for each local Bezier curve segment of the CR spline. Once the curve parameters t for a query point (P x , P y , P z ) in world space have been found, we can map that point to all corresponding positions in tangent space, evaluate the implicit sweep, and compose the implicit values B ′ (P t , P n , P b ) obtained in tangent space using the union operator defined in Equation 3.2</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">B(P x , P y , P z ) = min li {B ′ (W −1 (P x , P y , P z ))}.<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Sweep templates are usually sparsely present at specific curve parameters t, hence some interpolation method is required to compute the sweep at intermediary positions. For tangent space points, the P t coordinate directly corresponds to the curve parameter t which leads to a stacked arrangement of the sweep templates (see <ref type="figure">Figure  4</ref>, right). This setting allows for a straightforward interpolation between the implicit templates. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>, linear interpolation is applied, which leads to C 1 discontinuities that are undesirable in our scenario since we want to model organic structures (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref>, left). To blend the distance field templates, we use CR splines CR 0.7 T i (t) where T i = T i (P n , P b ) are the values sampled from the implicit sweep template associated with parameter value t i . The implicit distance value for a point P = (P t , P n , P b ) in tangent space is thus defined as follows B ′ (P t , P n , P b ) = CR 0.7</p><p>T i (P t ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Robust Template Blending</head><p>Interpolations of signed distance fields generally have to be treated with care. Problems occur if the (negative) inside-regions of adjacent sweep templates are not aligned. Suppose an extreme case, where the inside-regions of two adjacent templates have no overlap at all, as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref> (left). If the fields are interpolated, the resulting volume will have two disconnected regions, since there are intermediate blends where the whole interpolated template is positive.</p><p>In cases where the inside-regions of adjacent templates expose a partial overlap, the volume is usually connected, which means the interpolated templates do contain negative regions. These are, however, significantly smaller than those of the surrounding templates, which leads to visible artifacts that could be misinterpreted as stenoses. For well-behaved centerline trees, this problem should not occur, since the centerline is defined to be in the center of a vessel. However, in the presence of pathologies, large calcifications or noisy datasets of lowresolution, automatic segmentation algorithms frequently deliver inconsistent models with a poor alignment of the vascular contours.</p><p>To inherently handle such constellations, we introduce a splinebased blending technique which automatically aligns the shape templates in tangent space. The key idea is, not to blend in the t direction as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref> (left), but to blend along an additional CR spline CR 0.7 mean i (t) as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref> (right). The spline is constructed to pass through the centers of gravity of the vascular contours in tangent space and basically leads a translational alignment of the blended implicit templates. This technique greatly increases the robustness of our system in handling poorly conditioned segmentations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">BLENDING VASCULAR BRANCHES</head><p>To model whole vascular trees, the individual implicit branches B i constructed in Section 3.2 need to be unified to form the global implicit indicator function V . To achieve a composition with smooth joints at vascular furcations, we use an extension of the Wyvill field function <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> to map the pseudo distance field B of an individual branch to a potential field.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">f wyvill (x) = (1 − x 2 ) 3 : R → [0, 1]<label>(11)</label></formula><p>In contrast to f wyvill , we design our field function f w (x) : R → [−1, 0], generates fields which are negative inside objects.

While B has global support and the object boundary is defined by B = 0, the potential field f w (B) has local support and the isocontour f w (B) = −0.5 corresponds to the boundary. A rich set of blending operators is available that allows to create smooth unions of these fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref> . When dealing with complex vascular trees, there are frequent constellations where vessels run in close proximity to each other. To prevent an unintentional blending of unrelated adjacent vessels, we exploit the topological information of the centerline tree to compute blend weights b(t) ∈ [0, 1] similar to the blend graphs used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The blend weights b are <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>. Comparison of two different blending techniques for composing a vascular tree.

In our modeling approach, the two vessels have a certain area where they overlap. In this case, the application of standard blending operators leads to a visible bulging artifact that would most certainly influence subsequent simulations on the model. This is also the case for an increased blend range of the operator min li which we used to resolve ambiguities in branches. Fortunately, this problem has very recently been solved <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> by using a quasi-C ∞ operator min g ( f 1 , f 2 ), which allows to generate smooth and truly bulge-free hierarchical blends. The key idea is to modulate the blending properties of the operator with the angle between the gradients of the participating implicit fields. Using min g , the implicit indicator function V for the whole vascular tree is defined as the recursive binary composition of all individual branches B i .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">INTERACTIVE MODEL CORRECTION</head><p>Vascular trees are complex structures that usually consist of many branches, each containing arbitrarily many contour definitions. For an interactive correction application, this leads to a demanding environment in terms of user navigation and computational complexity. In this section we will first give a brief overview of our interaction paradigm. We will then describe our culling-and isosurface extraction pipeline that allows an interactive editing of high-quality vascular models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Interaction Concept</head><p>Our interaction framework uses triangular meshes to visualize the current vascular model during editing. Additionally, a volume dataset can be loaded to verify the segmentation in overlay renderings. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) images provide a contrast agentenhanced view of the patient-specific vascular structures and thus constitute a common choice. If the user clicks on an arbitrary point on the 3D mesh, a linked orthogonal multiplanar reformation (MPR) view is shown. This allows to inspect the corresponding cross section of the current model as an overlay on the original image (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 11)</ref>. Using the mouse-wheel, the user is able to move up and down along the current branch which allows for a fast visual inspection of the model. If desired, a snapping feature can be activated which snaps the view to existing nearby contours on the current vessel. If the user is discontent with the model at a certain position, he can simply sketch a corrected contour in the MPR view to get an instantly updated global model. If a prescribed contour was already present, it will be replaced, otherwise a new contour will be inserted into the branch, if a contour is deleted, it will be removed from the model.  Computational hemodynamics algorithms often require masks or meshes to be annotated with inflow and outflow information. Exploiting the topological information contained in a geometric centerline model, we can automatically determine which end-nodes of the tree will most likely be inflows or outflows. To allow for an easy tagging of mesh vertices or mask voxels, we extended our model evaluation scheme to keep track of the closest vessel and the corresponding parameter value. It is straight forward to do this, since before applying f w the implicit values of the branches B i (P) correspond to the distances to the respective branches. By additionally returning the branch with the smallest distance, our system is able to directly associate world space positions P with that branch and the corresponding centerline parameter F(t).With this information we can mark vertices or voxels as inflow or outflow based on their proximity to previously tagged centerline nodes. In interactive sessions, we can thus immediately generate initial proposals for these tags as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 8</ref>. If areas are tagged incorrectly, they can easily be reassigned by the user using a hot-key.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Segment-based Culling</head><p>To generate a mesh for visualization, polygonizers need to evaluate the implicit sweep V at (many) world space positions P = (P x , P y , P z ). For every evaluation of V , we need to compute all potential projections to vessel centerlines (recall Section 3.2). This is the most computationally expensive step in the evaluation process since we need to find the roots of a polynomial of degree five. (i.e. solve for all t in Equation 8). To localize computations, we use a culling strategy based on axis aligned bounding boxes (AABBs). For this, we split the CR spline of the centerline into individual piecewise cubic Bezier curve segments for which we compute AABBs. Since we have limited a-priori knowledge about the actual surface which belongs to a Bezier segment, we heuristically determine conservative bounds for each segment. Due to the convex hull property of Bezier curves we can use the local control polygon to bound the centerline segment. In addition, we can determine the farthest distance</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">D max i = max(|F i − o j i |)</formula><p>, j ∈ 0 . . . n from a centerline position F i to the corresponding vessel contour O i . To determine the bounds of a Bezier segment we thus compute the AABB of its control points and extend it by the maximum of the distances max(D max prev , D max next ) as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 9</ref>. Since centerline nodes need not be associated with a contour D max prev and D max next here refer to the closest previous or subsequent node respectively, which is associated with a non empty contour. Since the blending operator g, which we apply as described in Section 4, increases the influence of local segments, the AABBs may need an additional extension proportional to the blend range multiplied by the local blend weight b(t). To allow for fast localized queries to V , we finally compute an octree for the segment AABBs as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 10</ref>. During evaluation we use the octree to gather a local subset of centerline segments which have to be considered when evaluating a point P = (P x , P y , P z ).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Isosurface Extraction</head><p>To efficiently generate visualizations during interactive sessions, we use a propagation-based marching cubes (MC) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> that extracts mesh approximations of the underlying model. Instead of evaluating all cells in the volume, that method tracks the isosurface with an advancing front from preselected seed cells. For each cell, the selection of neighboring cells which need to be evaluated can be made by examining the marching cubes configuration of the current cell. The problem with such methods usually lies in the determination of the seed cells. In our scenario, however, we can exploit the geometric information provided by the centerline description, since it allows us to make a precise guess about where the surface will pass in space. For each branch, we generate two seeds, one at its beginning and one at its end, yielding #branches * 2 total seed cells. We advance the cell fronts for each seed cell in separate threads which are synchronized at cell access. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> shows the seeds and cells and their thread affinity for a single vessel branch.</p><p>Computational hemodynamics based on meshes has high demands on the triangle quality and density distribution. The polygonization approach described in the previous paragraph does in general not meet these demands. Its purpose lies, however, in the instant visualization of the current implicit model during editing. The final result of our method is the global implicit indicator function V with an arbitrarily high precision that is determined by the resolution of the shape templates T i . For simulation frameworks that require meshes as input, this indicator function can immediately be polygonized with methods tuned for triangle quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Local Model Updates</head><p>During user interactions, the aim is to quickly generate updated visualizations. For this, we use a localized update strategy that only recomputes the changed portions of the surface. When the user deletes, modifies or creates a contour, we bound the modification based on the AABBs computed in Section 5.2. For this, we need to account for the support of the CR spline-based template interpolation. If an implicit template changes, two neighboring segments may potentially change their appearance. During a modification, the model may grow or shrink. We thus create an AABB that bounds all affected segments and update the model description with the new contour. We then create another AABB for the modified affected segments and finally merge those two AABBs, which yields the final bounds AABB mod for the user modification as indicated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 11 (center, left)</ref>.</p><p>To create an updated surface mesh, it is sufficient to recompute the surface inside of AABB mod . For this, we first clear the evaluations of the previous MC run in AABB mod . While doing this, we flag all cells which previously intersected the surface and lie at the border of AABB mod as seeds. Since we know the new surface will be consistent with the old surface beyond AABB mod , these seeds provide perfect entry points for the subsequent local isosurface extraction. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 11</ref> (center, right), seed cells generated this way are visualized in red color.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">RESULTS</head><p>To validate the models generated by our method, we applied it to a variety of segmentations, including cerebral vessel trees, arterial wholebody vessel trees and coronary vessel trees. For these applications our method generated smooth high-quality models with an instant manual correction capability. In addition, our method has been applied for the manual creation of 30 coronary segmentations in an ongoing validation study that compares computational hemodynamics-based FFR simulations with invasively measured blood flow data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Model Smoothness</head><p>Since our method uses CR splines to define the sweep templates and trajectories and to interpolate the sweep in tangent space, our models generally expose C 1 continuity. This continuity is preserved by the union operator min li and the gradient-based branch blending operator min g . By design, our method interpolates all prescribed contours which is important for consistent feedback during interactive editing sessions. For the visualization of vascular trees from noisy segmentations however, the ability to generate smoothed results is important. Our method can easily be extended to support this by applying smoothing kernels to the discretized shape templates T i . Another way is to blend the templates with a smooth shape, which leads to a modified template function</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">T ′ i (P n , P b ) = T i (P n , P b ) * (1 − s) + shape(P n , P b ) * s.</formula><p>This can be seen as a regularization scheme which allows to restrict  the cross-sectional shapes of vessels to a limited deviation from a target shape depending on a smoothness parameter s ∈ <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">0]</ref>. Typical shapes are ellipses or circles which can directly be fitted to the corresponding contour polygon. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref> shows the impact of an increasing smoothness parameter s.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Comparative Study</head><p>We qualitatively compared our method to the technique described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, since it is also based on implicit sweep surfaces and to our knowledge the only method with a model quality comparable to ours. The main difference is that the authors use piecewise algebraic splines (PAS) with an inherent smoothness parameter σ as the underlying implicit representation. This results in superior theoretical smoothness and continuity properties for their models. To perform a direct comparison, we implemented the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and incorporated it in our system. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 14</ref> shows close-up views of a coronary model that illustrates the high similarity of both methods for cubic PAS splines with a low smoothness parameter σ = 2. The most prominent difference we noticed in the resulting models was a shrinkage of vessels for increased smoothness parameters σ . As mentioned in Section 2.4, this effect is induced by the approximating character of the implicit algebraic spline representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> for the vascular contours. An increased smoothness thus comes at the cost of an increased shrinkage as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 14</ref> (center, right). Our explicit blending-based smoothing strategy (see Section 6.1) does not suffer from this effect. The geometric regularization shape can even be designed to have the same area as the corresponding free-form contour. This results in a very low impact of smoothing on the overall volume of a model which is an important quantity in the vascular domain. The development of our method was driven by the observation, that a manual inspection and correction system is essential for practical computational hemodynamics applications. Hence, an important feature of our method is its support for interactive editing. A major drawback of the PAS method is its computational complexity and the resulting model generation times. The reconstruction times of 1-3 minutes reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, which were already achieved with an optimized CUDA implementation, do not allow for interactive workflows.</p><p>Since <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> presents a combination of a segmentation algorithm and a subsequent modeling method, the presence of a cross-sectional contour is assumed for every centerline point. Our method explicitly supports centerline points that do not contain a vascular contour, but only contribute information about the centerline trajectory. This allows the sampling of the centerline to be independent of the number of crosssectional definitions. For a given centerline of arbitrary complexity, a single contour is thus sufficient to define the whole sweep with a constant cross-section. In addition, this allows the user to adaptively place  <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> (red surface) with our models (blue overlay). Smoothness parameter sigma for <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> from left to right: 2, 5, 6. Blend range for our method was set to w = 3mm in all examples. Left: for a low σ both methods are qualitatively indistinguishable (notice the z-fighting of the overlays which results from highly similar surfaces). Center, Right: for higher smoothness parameters σ PAS models visibly shrink due to their approximating nature. more contours in pathological regions like stenoses or aneurysms, while leaving less detailed regions with sparse contour information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Quantitative Comparison</head><p>To quantitatively validate our method, we compared the results to our implementation of PAS and an implementation of convolution surfaces (CS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> that is shipped with the medical imaging framework MeVisLab <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows Hausdorff distance statistics measured between our models and meshes extracted from PAS and CS models. For σ = 2 the mean distance between our models and PAS models is &lt; 0.07mm which is fraction of the voxel size delivered by current CT or MRI protocols. Note that the high increase in the surface distances to the PAS method for σ = 6 is due the loss of entire regions of thin vessels during isosurface extraction. This is an effect of shrinkage since the uniform MC algorithm cannot adequately sample vessels if they become too thin. As indicated by <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, the effect is particularly pronounced for vascular trees with thin vessels like coronary or cerebral trees. The cerebral tree model only contained radii associated with centerline nodes. Our method easily supports this type of data, if the shape templates are replaced with implicit circle definitions, similar as in the smoothing approach presented in Section 6.1. Since CS only support radial models, we could not compare the results for the other datasets. CS models and our models are, however, very similar except for the fact that convolution surfaces inherently generate rounded caps at vessel ends. These are precisely the regions where both methods have the largest differences and which account for the max error in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Performance</head><p>The time needed to generate and visualize our models is mainly determined by the number of vascular cross sections that are present and by the resolution of the mesh that is extracted. The rasterization time for the cross sections depends on the target resolution of the template images. In all examples shown in this article, this resolution was set to 64 × 64 since it is a good trade-off between accuracy and rasterization time. Computation times are, however, mostly dominated by the isosurface extraction since it involves the costly root finding as mentioned in Section 5.2. The initial complete mesh generation time is usually in the range of 2.5 -4.5 seconds for real world vascular trees with a marching cubes resolution of 256 3 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). After this, interactive local modifications take less than 0.5 seconds on our datasets which is fast enough for interactive feedback. Local update times are mainly determined by the density and the constellation of the templates. Here, models with a dense template configuration result in faster update rates, because the template support is spatially more restricted. Changing a template in a sparse model, in contrast, causes large portions of a branch model to change which leads to a more global recomputation of the mesh. This behavior is reflected in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table  2</ref> which shows that updates for the cerebral tree are very fast, even if its model is substantially larger than the arterial and the coronary trees. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5">Simulation Example</head><p>The benefit of our manual correction method can be demonstrated by the following example. The velocity visualizations shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 16</ref> were generated using a Lattice-Boltzmann simulation technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> that was executed on a binary mask generated from our global indicator function V . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 16 (left)</ref> shows the results for the original automatic centerline-based segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Since it did not accurately capture a present calcification, the velocity magnitude colorcoded streamlines exhibit no saliencies and indicate a normal blood flow. The results on the right, in contrast, were generated from a corrected vascular model and clearly indicate the temporarily increased velocity of the blood flow inside the stenosis. This illustrates, that even small shortcomings in a segmentation can result in significantly distorted simulation results. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 16</ref>. Streamline visualization with color-coded simulated blood velocities generated with a Lattice-Boltzmann method <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.Left: the automatically segmented model did not capture a stenosis that was present and thus leads to an unsuspicious velocity pattern. Right: the corrected model reveals the increased blood velocity inside the stenosis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We have presented a fast and robust method to generate high-quality vascular models from geometric centerline descriptions. By employing a local update mechanism, it is in particular fast enough to allow for local model updates at interactive rates without resorting to a simplified model representation. Our method incorporates a useradjustable smoothness parameter which allows to choose between a strictly interpolatory or an approximating behavior depending on the application. A blend range parameter can be used to control the blending behavior at vascular furcations. The implicit modeling approach guarantees that all models are self-intersection free and expose C 1 continuity. In addition it inherently provides an assignment of locations in space to a specific vessel branch and the corresponding parameter of the centerline spline. This property can easily be used to automatically annotate meshes and voxelizations with inflow and outflow information as it is required by many computational hemodynamics frameworks. Our method thus enables the creation efficient workflows to manually inspect and correct automatic segmentations or to create new ones given a presegmented centerline tree. We have applied and evaluated our approach on a variety of clinical datasets and have shown its improvements over similar state-of-the-art methods. We have provided case studies that confirm the important contributions that our method brings to the clinical computational fluid dynamics pipeline. Currently our method is implemented in a prototyping application. Future work will focus on the tuning of our interaction concepts for the clinical environment and on the tight integration of our method into corresponding simulation frameworks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Comparison of distance field modeling and potential field modeling.
