<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION 1.Motivation</head><p>With the fast generation of large and complex data nowadays, it is desirable to develop new frameworks aiming at generating a visualization of the entire data needed for navigation, detection, exploration and a global understanding of selected objects or regions of interest (ROIs). Complex geometric structures are often better visualized and analyzed by mapping the surface properties, such as normal map, angle, or area, to a simple canonical domain, such as a rectangle or a sphere. Surface flattening and texture mapping offer a good way of visualizing a surface section by enabling the visualization of all surface parts within a single planar image.</p><p>In general, surface flattening and texture mapping unavoidably introduces distortions. There are two types of distortions, angle distortion and area distortion. A mapping, which is both angle preservation and area preservation, must be isometric. Therefore, the surface must have zero Gaussian curvature everywhere, namely a developable surface or a ruled surface. For general surfaces, one can only choose either angle-preservation mapping or area-preservation mapping, but never both of them simultaneously.</p><p>Angle-preservation (conformal) mapping/surface flattening preserves local shapes, and thus has been broadly used in many feature oriented applications in visualization and medical imaging. However, a conformal method usually substantially distorts area, thus failing to display accurate size of area, including height, width, thickness or diameter of ROIs. Unfortunately, these distorted area parameters are extremely important in many medical image recognition and auto diagnosis applications, such as brain fold detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> or colon polyps detection and diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Moreover, it is well known that conformal mapping induces severe area distortions for surfaces with long tube shapes, such as the elongated lion head model, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>. This disadvantage derives from the fundamental obstacle of conformal mapping theory and we can not easily overcome it. Imagine a cylinder r(θ , z) = (cos θ , sin θ , z), a conformal mapping φ (θ , z) = e −z (cos θ , sin θ ) maps it to the unit disk, the area distortion factor e −2z is exponential with respect to the height z, and in practice easily exceeds the machine precision.</p><p>By comparison, area-preservation mapping can generate accurate and information lossless mapping results, which is a key objective for many medical imaging applications, with the ability to carry out measurements for detecting anatomic abnormalities. For example, in virtual colonoscopy, the physician may want to measure and compare different sizes of polyps, in order to determine disease conditions and cancer risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. A special case of this problem also occurs in any application where volume or area measurement is critical (e.g., brain data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>). From human cognition perspective, area-preservation mapping and flattening can also enhance the viewer's ability to easily recognize the component-aware patches or long branch parts distribution of models, and consequently understand the local feature with the knowledge of a global structure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 2)</ref>. Therefore, area-preservation mapping has vast potentials for many visualization and graphics applications.</p><p>To simultaneously tackle the above challenges, we have developed a flattening framework which provides a global view of the surface with minimal area distortion, while, at the same time, maximally preserving local angle/shape features on the flattened surface. In this work, we introduce our flattening framework using optimal mass transport (OMT), based on Monge-Brenier theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Optimal Mass Transport</head><p>Our approach is inspired by the similarity between our mapping problem and the OMT problem. Monge <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> has raised the classical OMT problem that concerns determining the optimal way, with minimal transportation cost, to move a pile of soil from one place to another. Formally, spaces X and Y are with measures μ and ν, respectively, the transportation cost for moving from x ∈ X to y ∈ Y is c(x, y). The optimal transport map T : X → Y is measure preserving, namely for any B ⊂ Y , ν(B) = μ(T −1 (B)), it minimizes the total transportation cost X c(x, T (x))μ(x)dx. From OMT perspective, the surface mapping/flattening can be viewed as an optimal transport map T , and the size of area can be viewed as the preserved measures μ and ν.</p><p>The solution of the OMT problem lies at the following theory. Kantorovich <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> has proved the existence and uniqueness of the optimal transport plan. The Monge-Kantorovich optimization is as follows, the space X and Y are discretized to samples</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X = {x 1 , x 2 , ••• , x n }, Y = {y 1 , y 2 , ••• , y n }, with Dirac measures μ = {μ i }, ν = {ν j }.</formula><p>A transport plan is represented as n 2 unknown variables γ i j , ∑ i γ i j = ∑ j γ i j = 1, γ i j represents the percentage of μ i at x i , which is transported to y j . Then the total transportation cost is a linear function ∑ i j γ i j c(x i , y j ). Thus the optimal transport plan can be solved using a linear programming method on n 2 variables.</p><p>Monge-Kantorovich optimization has been used in numerous fields from physics, econometrics to computer science, including data compression and image processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Recently, researchers have realized that optimal transport could provide a powerful tool in image processing, if one could reduce its high computational cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. However, it has one fundamental disadvantage that the number of variables is O(n 2 ), which is unacceptable to visualization and graphics applications since a high resolution 3D/volume dataset normally includes more than <ref type="bibr">10 6</ref> vertices.</p><p>An alternative Monge-Brenier optimization can significantly reduce the number of variables. Brenier <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> has developed a different approach for special optimal transport problem, where the cost function c(x, y) is a quadratic distance c(x, y) = x − y 2 . Brenier's theory proves that there is a convex function u : X → R, and the unique optimal transport map is given by its gradient map, x → gradu(x). The Monge-Brenier's approach reduces the unknown variables from n 2 to n, which greatly reduces the computational cost, and improves the efficiency. In our framework, we follow Monge-Brenier's approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Area-Preservation Mapping/Flattening</head><p>Texture mapping on arbitrary surfaces with minimal distortion can preserve the local and global structure of the texture <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Dominitz and Tannanbaum <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> have proposed a method to compose conformal mapping with an area-preservation mapping, using the technique of OMT, based on Monge-Kantorovich theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, which accurately preserves the area element and also maximally preserves the angle. Suppose we want to compute an area-preservation map from a metric surface (S, g), where g is the Riemannian metric, to the planar disk D. The method starts with an angle preserving φ : S → D, which introduces area distortions on the disk; the area distortion factor is used to define a measure on the disk, denoted as μ. Then, an optimal mass transport map is computed between the disk with this measure and the disk with the Euclidean measure dxdy, ψ : (D, μ) → (D, dxdy). The composition ψ • φ : S → D gives the area-preservation map.</p><p>Their method is based on Monge-Kantorovich's theory and approaches, which require n 2 variables. For example, in image registration applications, a 1024 × 1024 image would result in 2 40 variables, the storage cost is thus very high, and the computation is extremely expensive.</p><p>In contrast, we use Monge-Brenier's approach to compute the optimal transport map. Our discrete algorithm is solidly based on the variational principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Basically, we only discretize the target space Y , and find a convex function whose gradient gives the optimal transport map. Finding the OMT is equivalent to optimizing a convex energy, which can be efficiently achieved using Newton's method. The whole computation requires only n variables. Therefore, this method greatly reduces the computation cost and improves the efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Our Contributions</head><p>The key contribution of this work is the introduction of a novel areapreservation mapping/flattening algorithm using the optimal transport technique, based on Monge-Brenier theory. The new method has the following merits:</p><p>• It reduces the number of variables from n 2 to n, greatly reducing the complexity.</p><p>• It converts the optimal mass transport problem to a convex optimization problem, and can be solved using Newton's method, greatly improving the efficiency.</p><p>• The algorithm gives users full control of the size of area everywhere. Users can design and manipulate the area of each triangular component freely, improving the flexibility.</p><p>The organization of this paper is as follows: In Section 2, we review and discuss related work. In Section 3 and Section 4, we describe the theory of our OMT optimization and sketch the analytical procedure and algorithms to find the optimal mapping. We illustrate examples using our framework, discuss relevant implementation issues and present distortion comparisons in Section 5. Finally, in Section 6, we summarize our work as conclusion and propose some possible future research directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>We review the research projects on optimal mass transport that are most relevant to our approach targeting both algorithms and applications, and discuss the comparisons with our framework.</p><p>Theoretic Development. In 1781, Monge <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> has formulated the OMT problem. In the 1940's, Kantorovich <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> has proved the existence and the uniqueness of the optimal transport plan. At the end of 1980's, Briener <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> has proved that the optimal transport map is the gradient map of a convex function, when the transportation cost is the quadratic of the Euclidean distance. In the discrete case, Brenier's result is equivalent to the existence and the uniqueness of the convex polyhedron with prescribed projected facet areas. This has been first shown by Alexandroff <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> in 1920's. Aurenhammer <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> has shown the connection between Brenier's construction and power diagram, where the existence has been proven. Recently, the connection between the discrete optimal transport map and the discrete Monge-Ampere equation, which is based on variational approach, has been given by Gu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Monge-Kantorovich Approach. Most existing works are based on Monge-Kantorovich approach. Bonnel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> have proposed a method for interpolation between distributions or functions based on advection instead of blending for rendering purposes. This method decomposes distributions or functions into sums of radial basis functions (RBFs), then solves a mass transport problem to pair the RBFs and applies partial transport to obtain the interpolated function. Rubner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> have proposed a content based image retrieval method using the earth mover distance as a metric for the OMT problem. However, it fails to give a warped grid, an essential requirement for image registration and image morphing. Rehman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> have listed several advantages of the OMT method for multiresolution 2D/3D nonrigid registration. Meanwhile, they stress the fact that the optimization of OMT is computationally expensive and emphasize that it is important to find efficient numerical methods to solve this issue.</p><p>Monge-Brenier's Approach. The following techniques are based on Monge-Brenier's approach. Merigot <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> has proposed a multiscale approach to solve the optimal transport problem. To solve an optimal transport problem between a measure with density μ to a discrete measure ν, this method builds a sequence ν 0 = ν,...,ν L of simplifications. Then, it first solves the easier transport problem between μ and ν L , and uses the solution of the problem to be the initial guess for the optimal transport between μ and ν (L−1) . This step is iterated until a solution to the original OMT problem. The method is applied for computing the Wasserstein distances between probability distributions, and for image interpolation. de Goes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> have provided an optimal transport driven approach for 2D shape reconstruction and simplification. They have further presented a formulation of capacity constrained Voronoi tessellation as an optimal transport problem for image processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. This method produces high quality blue noise point sets with improved spectral and spatial properties. Compared to our method, de Goes's method only applies between 2D domains while our method maps a 3D surface to a 2D domain. Our method can further lead to a fast, scalable algorithm to generate high quality blue noise point distributions of arbitrary density functions.</p><p>Minimal Flow Method. Tannenbaum group has introduced this novel approach. The basic idea is to construct an initial mass preservation mapping, then deform the mapping such that the total transportation cost is reduced and the deformed mapping is still mass preserving.</p><p>Namely, it designs a gradient flow in the space of all mass preservation mapping space. Haker et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> have presented a method for image registration and warping based on the OMT. The method is parameter free and has the unique global optimum. However, its linear programming of the optimal map can be solved with O(n 2 ) variables, which is prohibitively expensive when n is large. Zhu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> have combined conformal mapping and area-preservation mapping for flattening branched physiological surfaces, such as vessels. The optimal transport map is carried using the minimal flow approach. Similar method has been applied for image morphing <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Rehman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> have applied the minimizing flow approach for the OMT with applications to non-rigid 3D image registration. The implementation also employs multi-grid and parallel methodologies on a consumer graphics processing unit (GPU) for fast computation. Although computing the optimal map has been shown to be computationally expensive in the past, we show that our approach is orders of magnitude faster than previous work. Dominitz and Tannenbaum <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> have proposed to use the OMT for texture mapping. The method begins with an anglepreservation mapping and then corrects it using the mass transport procedure derived via a certain gradient flow. A multiresolution scheme is incorporated into the flow to obtain fast convergence to the optimal mapping. Both methods require designing divergence free vector fields to drive a diffeomorphic flow to minimize the energy.</p><p>Comparison. Our method mainly follows the Monge-Brenier approach, based on the variational principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Comparing to the state-of-the-art techniques, it has many merits as follows:</p><p>• Comparing to the Monge-Kantorovich approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, our method only requires O(n) variables. In contrast, Kantorovich approach requires O(n 2 ) variables. Therefore, our method greatly reduces the storage complexity, and it is thus much more efficient.</p><p>• Comparing to the Monge-Brenier based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, all the existing methods are for image processing tasks. Our method however focuses on surfaces. For image processing, the samples are relatively uniform, and therefore, the computation is relatively stable. In our case, the sample points are produced by the conformal mapping, the sample density is highly non-uniform, and thus conventional methods are very vulnerable and errorprone for the large area distortions induced by the conformal mapping. Our experiments indicate that conventional methods are not robust enough. Therefore, we have specially designed our step length control algorithm (Section 4.2) to improve the robustness.</p><p>• Comparing to the minizing flow methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>, the solution of latter is equivalent to a gradient descend method for optimizing the transportation cost. In contrast, our method is equivalent to the Newton's method to optimize a convex energy, which has a higher order convergence rate. Therefore, our method is more efficient.</p></div>

Suppose (S, g) is a surface embedded in R 3 , with the induced Euclidean metric g. Let the mapping φ : (S, g) → (D, dx 2 + dy 2 ) transform the surface to the planar unit disk D, where dx 2 + dy 2 is the planar Euclidean metric.

For the input, aiming to get ROIs with arbitrary shape (e.g., irregular shape of the brain folds), we utilize the saliency map <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> for the ROI detection. Once users specify local area weight w i everywhere, the system will iteratively solve the OMT map and refine the area-preservation result that yields strict equality of weighted sizes of area between the input surface and flattened plane. The area weighting parameter w i is defined as weighted areas in 2D or weighted volumes in 3D. After the generation of the OMT map (bijectively area-preservation mapping), we directly apply the ROI guided texture mapping to obtain the output. Merits of Saliency Map. The application of saliency map can (1) accurately detect arbitrary ROI shape to obtain the accurate area preservation; and (2) provide hierarchical resolution of surface models, supporting the reduction of triangles in the context area, while preserving high resolution ones in ROIs, for the purpose of fast computation. Take the brain model as an example, instead of using the original model with 100K faces, with the saliency guided ROI detection, we can significantly reduce the face account to 10K or less (data oriented).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Initialization</head><p>Our algorithm uses the conformal mapping result (angle preservation) to set up the initial position for each vertex v i . We first normalize the mesh such that its total area equals to the area of the planar domain Ω. We then initialize a discrete conformal mapping φ : M → D. In our framework, we utilize the discrete Ricci flow method <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> to achieve this step.

Fix a height vector, the support planes are given by π i (h) : x, y i + h i , the convex function is u h (x) = max i x, y i + h i , and its graph G(h) can be computed as upper envelope of the supporting plane π i (h). The projection of G(h) onto Ω forms a polygonal partition Ω = i W i (h).</p><p>The implementation details are listed in Alg. 1. In order to preserve the area of cell W i , we need to iteratively update the virtual variable for each vertex with height vector h = (h 1 , h 2 , ••• , h n ) (details in the paragraph Initial Height Vector below). Thus, in each iteration, we first compute the power diagram, using each vertex as a point and the weighted radius as the power in the diagram. Then, in step 3, we compute the dual triangulation of this calculated power diagram (details in </p><formula xml:id="formula_20">W i → φ (v i ).</formula><p>the paragraph Power Diagram below). We record every edge length in both the power diagram and its dual triangulation in this step to form the Hessian matrix.

Finally, in step 6, we update the vertex position as the center of the power Voronoi diagram to obtain the parameterization result with area-preservation. Power Diagram. The OMT based area-preservation computation for the partition of Ω is equivalent to the classical power diagram in computational geometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Given a point set Y = {y 1 , y 2 , ••• , y n }, each point y i associated with the weight w i as its power, the power distance from any point x to y i is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">Pow(x, y i ) = 1 2 x − y i 2 − 1 2 w i ,</formula><p>Then, the power diagram is the Voronoi diagram when we use the power distance instead of the standard Euclidean distance. In our method, the partition induced by the convex function u h in Eqn. 3 is equivalent to the power diagram with the power weight:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">w i = 2h i + y i , y i .</formula><p>Therefore, the computation can be carried out using power diagram functionalities in standard computational geometry library, such as CGAL <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.

During the computation, it is crucial to ensure that all the cells W i (h) ∩ Ω are non-empty. Suppose at step k all the cells are non-empty, then, we update h k ← h k +εH(h k ) −1 ∇E(h k ). If some cells are empty in the power diagram induced by h k+1 , we will return to h l , shrink the step length ε to be 1/2ε, and try again. If some cells are still degenerated, we shrink the step length iteratively, until all the power cells are non-empty.</p><p>Following the implementation details listed in Alg. 1, we have tested our algorithms on different surface models (details in Section 5). For practical implementations, we may need to deal with surface models with different topologies, such as the earth and brain models which are genus zero without any boundary, and map and graph cases which are genus zero with an open boundary. The basic idea is to make the topologies of the source domain and the parameter domain consistent. For example, if we want to map a genus zero surface without an open boundary, such as the brain surface, to a unit disk parameter domain, we cut a very small hole on the surface to get an open boundary so that the source domain and parameter domain have the consistent topology. </p></div>

With respect to user predefined mapping criteria (e.g., fix the disk boundary or fix the four corner points of a rectangular domain with the alignment of ROIs), the bijective texture mapping between parameterizations and image pixels is syntactically and semantically trivial. We directly call texture mapping functions provided by OpenGL with bilinear interpolation, which is fast and easy to implement.

By comparison with the conformal mapping method <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 6f</ref>), our framework ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6e)</ref> preserves major shape characteristics of the colon surface (e.g., colon folds) without any obviously visual distortion.</p><p>Arbitrary Area Weighting Scheme.

Each graph node stands for a network station, while each straight line depicts direct connection between two neighbor nodes. <ref type="figure">Fig. 9b</ref> enlarges the radius of the central core to increase the node separation, while compressing exterior nodes to further reduce the potential attention. <ref type="figure">Fig. 9c</ref> shows another area manipulation style: compressing central nodes while enlarging exterior nodes for further separation. There is no efficient way to generate a similar result using either geometry methods (e.g., conformal magnifier <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>) or deformation methods (e.g., moving least squares <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>). Taking a close look at <ref type="figure">Fig. 9d</ref>, the conformal magnifier fails to flexibly control magnification ratios in both focus and context regions.

By comparison, our system can easily manipulate the size of area everywhere to generate user preferred views with appropriate node distributions. Hierarchical Magnification. We can directly apply our mapping framework as a cascaded magnifier: applying the same magnifier repeatedly on the prior computing magnification result to obtain exponentially increasing magnification ratios. Since our method can accurately preserve the size of area by setting the target weight, we can guarantee that the final target region would be precise after each magnification process. <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref> shows that our hierarchical magnification can easily and accurately reach the high magnification ratio.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Implementation</head><p>In order to support fast visual display, our framework combines both CPU and GPU for computing optimization, parameterization, texture mapping and volume rendering using C++ with OpenGL library. Our algorithm and solution of the optimal transport map is easy to implement robustly to have interactive-rate computation for most experimental cases in this paper, overcoming a major limitation of the OMT problem -computation inefficiency. By comparison with other optimization algorithms, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, comparative experiments show that our system provides a significant speedup, empirically at least 3-5 times faster, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> (more comparison details are listed in Section 2). For the application of large volumetric data (e.g., brain dataset with size 256 2 × 142), we can easily obtain full resolution results in interactive-rate using various surface models with texture mapping or volume rendering. To further increase the flexibility of system control, our framework embeds mesh editing tools, allowing users to interactively choose a tradeoff between quality and computing speed. All experiments have been carried out on an Intel Core2Duo 2.2GHz laptop with 4GB memory and Windows 7 as the operating system.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Quantitative Analysis for Area-preservation Mapping</head><p>The main challenge of a good area-preservation mapping is yielding strict equality of area elements between the original surface and the flattened result at its final state. We examine both the area distortion and the quasi-conformal distortion per face over the mesh as the quantitative analysis. We define γ max and γ min as the larger and smaller eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the affine transformation that maps the domain triangles to the original surface, normalized with the hypothesis that the total area of the surface equals that of the domain. Then, the area distortion metric ϒ is computed as ϒ = log(γ max γ min ), while the quasi-conformal distortion metric Λ is computed using Λ = log( γ max γ min ). In both cases, zero indicates that there is no distortion and a larger value means a larger distortion. <ref type="figure">Fig. 11</ref> shows the histograms of the area distortion and the quasiconformal (angle) distortion for both conformal mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and our area-preservation approach, using the lion head surface model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig.  2)</ref>. By comparison with conformal mapping, as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 11b</ref>, our system can generate good area-preservation results with very small area distortions (the area-distortion error distribution is less than 2%) even for the complicated surface model (in theory, more complicated models typically lead to larger area distortion errors).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper, we present a new framework using the optimal mass transport method, which is implemented in a novel manner and used for various visualization and graphic applications. We present a computationally efficient numerical scheme to achieve the areapreservation mapping. With the combination of CPU and GPU, our system becomes practical for the use on large 3D datasets in terms of both speed and accuracy. Our system is built based on geometric parameterization techniques, where an area-preservation map with the minimal area distortion is generated for each input 3D surface model. The use of parameterization is compatible with various volume applications, easily and efficiently supporting the handling of various complicated data <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Moreover, the saliency map makes it easy and accurate to detect arbitrary ROIs and further supports mesh reduction in the context area. With respect to selected ROIs, results are generated after texture mapping or volume rendering using corresponding parameterized surface models to obtain flattened views with the optimized area preservation. In term of interactive operations, users can simply set different weights in the ROIs, enabling an extremely flexible style of area manipulations for data exploration and analysis. All experimental results and comparisons have demonstrated that our new OMT bases optimization approach has great potentials and applications in visualization and graphics.</p><p>A major limitation of our framework is that due to the mapping theory, our system inevitably generates angle distortions for achieving optimal area-preservation mapping. However, because we embed conformal mapping into our system (initialization), users can interactively select mapping styles to satisfy various requirements. For the future work, inspired by Sandhu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, our framework can be further extended to volumetric mapping. Meanwhile, because we use Voronoi diagram and its dual Delaunay triangulation for our OMT based mapping, inspired by Rong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, we can use the GPU to further accelerate the computing speed. In addition, a formal user study is necessary to further demonstrate advantages of our framework for various applications.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Disadvantages of conformal mapping for elongated shapes.

Right column: the angle distortion. By comparison, our framework (b) generates good mapping results with accurate area preservation and small angle distortions.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1"><head>Algorithm 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Area-preservation Mapping Input: Input triangular mesh M, total area π and area difference threshold δ w. Output: A unique diffeomorphic area-preservation mapping f : M → D, where D is a unit disk. The area w i of each cell W i ∈ D is close to the target area w i . 1. Run conformal mapping by discrete Ricci flow method [29] φ : M → D, where D is a unit disk. Assign each site φ (v i ) ∈ D with zero power weight, and target area w i = μ(v i ) defined above. Translate and scale all sites so that they are in the unit disk. 2. Compute the power diagram and calculate the area w i of each cell W i . 3. Compute the dual power Delaunay triangulation, and compute the lengths of edges in the diagram and triangulation to form the Hessian matrix of the convex energy in Eqn. 7 .</figDesc><table><row><cell>5.

Update the power h ← h + H −1 (w − w).i , denoted as c i . Then the area- preservation mapping is given by τ −1 • φ (v i ) = c i , where τ is the Brénier map τ :</note></figure>
