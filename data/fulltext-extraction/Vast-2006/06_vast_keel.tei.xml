				<p>We introduce a visual analytics environment for the support of remote-collaborative sense-making activities. Team members use their individual graphical interfaces to collect, organize and comprehend task-relevant information relative to their areas of expertise. A system of computational agents infers possible relationships among information items through the analysis of the spatial and temporal organization and collaborative use of information. The computational agents support the exchange of information among team members to converge their individual contributions. Our system allows users to navigate vast amounts of shared information effectively and remotely dispersed team members to work independently without diverting from common objectives as well as to minimize the necessary amount of verbal communication.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Research in information analysis and visualization often focuses on computational systems for the graphical representation of relationships among information items in a human comprehensible and fast accessible format. Little attention is paid to research that advances computational systems in their ability to recognize and subsequently consider relationships detected by humans. Any analysis and visualization of information, whether human or computer generated, has the potential of engaging the human mind in creative interpretations that can lead to the discovery of new relationships (interpretations) beyond what computational systems can detect. These relationships emerge through the diverse backgrounds and experiences of humans and are invaluable in the creative analysis of information. Since these relationships often remain within the minds of humans they are neither accessible to outsiders and computational systems nor can they be recorded or backed up.</p><p>The effective and thorough interpretation of an information space requires bringing together the human capacity for intuitive problem solving and the computer's capability for processing and visualizing large amounts of information. In other words, humans can not simply rely on data visualization tools and search engines for the detection of potentially important relationships but must personally engage in the discovery and evaluation of such relationships. While computationally discovered relationships enter the discourse of human mental considerations through advanced visualization techniques and data retrieval tools, human discovered relationships are less commonly transferred into the computational domain. The primary reason for this is the complex and distracting process of converting human discovered relationships for the use with computational systems. For example, asking humans to report all discovered relations among documents as a basis for future electronic processing would defer attention from more essential considerations during the examination of an information space.</p><p>The creative and incremental discovery of relationships among pieces of data, information and knowledge is commonly referred to as sense-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. For example, a stock broker may read a newspaper to construct (based on knowledge and past experience) non-obvious yet relevant relationships between news events and his/her stock portfolio. Typical sense-making tasks such as brainstorming, decision-making and problem-solving include the collection and visualization of task-relevant information, the analysis and comprehension of information, and the subsequent investigation of possible solutions and strategies. Sense-making activities commonly accumulate large amounts of data, information and knowledge, a lot of which is represented through external visual representations such as notes, graphics, diagrams, sketches and documents. Sense-makers develop a contextual understanding through the decomposition, combination, comparison, organization and analysis of such representations. While smaller and individual sense-making tasks can be handled mentally, more complex and collaborative sense-making tasks require the external representation and visual organization of information. The external representation and visual organization of information helps sense-makers compare, organize, comprehend and refl ect on what they know, to quickly access specifi c information when needed, to remember relevant thoughts and ideas, as well as to exchange knowledge and develop a shared understanding with other people.</p><p>While external representations visualize the contents of data, information and knowledge, the organization of external representations can refl ect contextual considerations. For example, if a person clips together a news article about Google's privacy policies and a news article about the public accessibility of information in China then we may assume a relationship between these two articles. Information is organized by many different people, in many different ways, and based on many different criteria and considerations. More commonly applied concepts for the organization of information often dominate. Computer generated information visualizations usually explicitly state relationships among information items thus allowing for quick and non-ambiguous explorations of an information space. Human generated information arrangements are often vague in regards to relationships thus inviting more creative interpretations of an information space. Consider, for example, the various different ways in which people organize documents on their desks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>. While the desk owner may be able to quickly locate any document, an outsider may initially spend some time evaluating the logic in the spatial organization of documents before being able to estimate the probable location of a particular document. While some of the organizational principles may be inferred from the spatial locations of documents others may require a more detailed investigation into the history, collaborative use and contents of documents.</p><p>In this paper we describe an agent supported computational environment for the visual organization and comprehension of information. A fi rst type of computational agents infers possible relationships among information items through the visual analysis of the users' spatial and temporal organization and collaborative use of information. A second type of agent analyzes these relationships to help users monitor, collect, organize, search for, exchange, and visualize information.</p><p>The primary objective of the computational agents is to infer from the visual organization of information as a basis to support "indirect collaboration" <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15]</ref>. By indirect collaboration we refer to situations in which individuals or groups of people work independently on sense-making tasks that comply with a common objective. The main advantage of indirect collaboration is that it allows for the remote, asynchronous, and intermittent participation of people with varying levels of involvement. Indirect collaboration also provides opportunities for anonymous contributions that are less infl uenced by social factors such as reputation, prestige and organizational status. The key challenge in indirect collaboration is information sharing among people that may not know each other, that may not work on a common task, that may operate under different circumstances, or that may have different foci, interests and objectives. Conventional solutions suggest shared data repositories and interfaces that allow for the collaborative storage, retrieval and visual representation of shared information. The use of shared information greatly benefi ts the qualitative outcome of collaborative sense-making tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, is more infl uential towards a fi nal group judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and allows participants to mutually confi rm each other's expertise <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>. However, the sharing of large amounts of information can lead to cognitive overloads and may signifi cantly slow down sense-making activities. Our agents system supports indirect collaboration among remotely distributed teams of sensemakers by analyzing the visual management of information, by determining what information should be shared with whom, and by automating the information exchange among users. We expect our agent system to help sense-makers effectively manage large amounts of shared information and reduce the necessary amount of verbal communication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">EWALL</head><p>In this section we introduce EWall, an experimental computational environment for the support of local and remote-collaborative sense-making activities as well as for the implementation and testing of computational agents that support such activities. We conceived the EWall system to help individuals and groups of people explore relationships among information items while simultaneously allowing observers and computational systems to estimate some of the users' mental considerations.</p><p>EWall's primary user interface is referred to as Workspace <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>, Lower Window). The Workspace allows for the visual collection and spatial organization of information. All information in EWall is represented in a visually space-saving, abstract and standardized format referred to as Cards. Cards display, embed and hyperlink the information they represent, and can easily be compared, organized and exchanged. Information to be displayed, embedded, or hyperlinked can simply be dropped onto Cards or the Workspace. Cards can be static or dynamically adapt modifi cations from Internet-based information sources. Cards can be grouped and hierarchically structured by placing Cards within the spatial boundaries of bigger Cards or by hyper-linking Cards to other Workspaces. Users can remotely collaborate in the development of a Card arrangement by copying Cards between their individual Workspaces or a shared Workspace. Users can also remotely communicate about a particular subject by using a Card's instant messaging feature.</p><p>The Workspace may be seen as an external representation of task-relevant issues that complements and intersects human internal considerations. Users spatially arrange Cards to develop a contextual understanding of a particular set of information. The spatial organization of Cards can signifi cantly infl uence comprehension and information access time <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref> as well as the quality of the task resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22]</ref>. A collaboratively developed Card arrangement also serves as a shared representation or group memory that can greatly enhance group interaction and shared understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>. For example, a group of researchers might collaboratively create a Card arrangement that represents various documents and ideas relevant for a publication. The researchers might group the Cards corresponding to proposed publication chapters. Another group might want to decide about a movie to watch, create a Card for each movie option and start grouping the Cards according to criteria such as preference, genre, or user ratings. There is no particular rule of how to use the Workspace nor do users have to be explicit about their considerations.</p><p>The Workspace concept draws from a variety of methods and technologies for the support of individual and collaborative sensemaking activities. For example, the NoteCards <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> developed at Xerox PARC provide an early example for computationally representing and interconnecting thoughts and ideas. William Pena's Problem Seeking methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref> suggests the use of small paper cards to capture comments and ideas during collaborative brainstorming sessions. Everitt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> investigated computational opportunities to keep track of and correlate physical Post-It notes during collaborative brainstorming sessions. Greenberg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> focused on the development of real-time collaborative surfaces that allow individual contributors to post and arrange information in an object-like format. Several commercial brainstorming applications also offer interfaces for representing and relating ideas in an objectlike format <ref type="bibr">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17]</ref>. Our Workspace complements and expands upon these methods and technologies through the design and realization of an inclusive computational framework for the easy creation, management and exchange of Cards as well as a Card design that combines a customizable and abstract layout with a large number of administrative and collaborative functions. EWall's secondary interface is referred to as the Kiosk <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>, Upper Window). The Kiosk displays a prioritized list of Cards that reference potentially task-relevant information available in shared databases and the Workspaces of other users. EWall estimates taskrelevant information based on its analysis of the users' spatial organization and collaborative use of Cards. Users may copy Cards from their Kiosk to their Workspace windows thus providing EWall with feedback about its suggestions. Users are not required to consider or specifi cally request EWall's suggestions nor does EWall directly interact with users to fi nd out about their preferences and interests. In other words, users gather knowledge through the casual and optional browsing, evaluation and adaptation of suggested Cards by EWall and EWall gathers knowledge through the analysis of the users' evolving Card arrangements, the collaborative use of Cards, as well as feedback derived from the adaptation of Cards by individual users. This so-called "indirect human computer interaction" causes minimal interference with human sense-making activities as it does not impose a particular work process, does not interrupt the work of users through direct interaction, does not confront humans with internal computational analyses (does not explicitly state why Cards are considered relevant), and clearly separates the interfaces controlled by the users (Workspace) and by EWall (Kiosk). Every Card copy indicates a successful suggestion and subsequently fosters additional suggestions based on similar considerations. This learning mechanism allows EWall to improve the accuracy of its suggestions as well as to dynamically adapt to particular users, tasks and circumstances.</p><p>EWall's way of suggesting relevant information is analogous to, and can proceed in parallel with, human observers that review and respond to a user's Card arrangement <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>). Human observers (collaborators, colleagues) can review a user's Card arrangement and respond with suggestions and comments that may or may not infl uence, inspire or stimulate future additions and modifi cations to the Card arrangement. Similarly, the EWall software analyzes a user's Workspace and responds with suggestions for potentially relevant information. The primary difference between human observers and EWall is that EWall does not engage users in a direct dialogue and that EWall offers a complementary computational perspective that draws from an extensive search and analysis of information on the Internet, shared databases, and the Workspaces of other users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">COMPUTATIONAL AGENTS</head><p>The information exchange in EWall is managed by two types of computational agents: Interpretation Agents and Transformation Agents. Interpretation Agents manage the fl ow of information from the users to EWall while Transformation Agents manage the fl ow of information from EWall to the users <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>). Interpretation Agents infer from the spatial and temporal organization and collaborative use of information as a basis for Transformation Agents to prioritize the information exchange among users, to help users search for and retrieve task-relevant information, or to dynamically assign teams of users. In other words, the computational agents learn about who needs to know what and investigate from where or whom this information may be acquired. Every individual agent is given a unique task many of which are modeled after human sensemaking activities. For example, an Interpretation Agent might assume relationships among Cards that are spatially located in close proximity and a Transformation Agent might determine a Card to be relevant for a particular user because another user has been using this Card in a similar context. As individual agents focus on specifi c aspects only the combination of multiple agents may achieve a particular result. The success of individual agents is determined based on the users' acquisition of suggested Cards. The infl uence of successful agents increases over time allowing the system to adapt to particular tasks, users and circumstances. Our agents do not directly communicate their conclusions with users but only adjust the fl ow of information so as to infl uence the sense-making process in ways that corresponds with the assigned objectives of particular agents. Interpretation Agents monitor user activities and translate their observations into relationships among Cards. ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> compares a Card arrangement as seen by the users with a Card arrangement as seen by the Interpretation Agents.) All discovered Cards and generated relationships are converged in a shared database <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>). Equivalent relations conceived by multiple Interpretation Agents are likely to become more infl uential in the database. For example, an Interpretation Agent might propose a relationship between two Cards because the Cards were created by the same user. Another Interpretation Agent may support this proposition due to the fact that both Cards were created during the same time frame. Contradictory relationships are not resolved but kept in memory assuming that at a later point in time the accumulation of additional relationships will put an end to the confl ict. The design of our Interpretation Agents emerged from a variety of cognitive and psychological theories and observations many of which deal with the cognitive perception of spatial object arrangements. For example, Wertheimer's <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref> research on perceptual organization provides valuable insights into how humans perceive relations among spatially arranged objects and suggests a set of principles for detecting object relations based on concept such as proximity, similarity, sequence, direction and past experience. The work Albert Zobrist and William Thompson <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref> focuses on the recognition of object clusters and introduces concepts such as curvilinear continuity, good closure and overall goodness grouping. Ullman <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref> investigated the cognitive perception of spatially arranged objects based on shapes and colors. Johnson <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref> introduced the concept of "habituation", the tendency to devote more attention to novel stimuli such as, for example, objects that have not been noticed previously, objects that appear suddenly, or objects that are located in odd or wrong locations. We implemented an initial set of fi ve Interpretation Agents to ensure the proper operation of our computational infrastructure as well as to demonstrate the integration and use of Interpretation Agents. These fi ve agents create relationships based on the spatial proximity, clustering, grouping, orthogonal alignment and modifi cation times of Cards. Various other Interpretation Agents are currently in the design stage. Our efforts focus primarily on creating relationships based on the spatial and temporal organization of Cards because these methods produce relationships that refl ect human mental considerations during sense-making activities, take advantage of our computational infrastructure, make a unique contribution, and are complementary with other methods for creating relationships among information items such as, for example, the semantic comparison of information contents <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> or the analysis of information access patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>. Transformation Agents analyze the relationships created by the Interpretation Agents to provide individual users with a customized selection of relevant information. The Transformation Agents determine user relevant information based on a comparison of relationships among Cards on the Workspaces of individual users and the relationships among Cards stored in the database. Every individual Transformation Agent specializes on one particular aspect when determining the relevance of information. For example, one Transformation Agent might search the database for Cards that maintain relationships with Cards on the user's Workspace View. Another Transformation Agent might increase the relevance of Cards that were created by authors from whom the user previously copied Cards. The relevance of information does not necessarily satisfy the interests of one particular user but a community of collaborating users as a whole. For example, if a particular Card were used by all but one collaborating user then the relevance of this Card would be considered high for the one user who is not yet using this Card. The conclusions from multiple Transformation Agents are combined and the resulting selection and sequence of Cards sent to the user's Kiosk window. The customized distribution of Cards by Transformation Agents can support a variety of sense-making activities such as managing the collaboration of users by determining what information is relevant to their work, by helping them comprehend the certainty associated with information, by helping them to converge or diverge their individual views and solutions, and by connecting together users with similar or complementary responsibilities, interests and backgrounds. The Transformation Agents not only allow users to navigate vast amounts of shared information more effectively but also remotely dispersed team members to work independently without diverting from common objectives as well as to minimize the necessary amount of verbal communication. We implemented an initial set of ten Transformation Agents to test and demonstrate the selection and prioritization of Cards for individual users. The operations of some of these Transformation Agents are explained in section 4.</p><p>Every Card copied from a Kiosk window provides the agent system with feedback about its performance and may trigger additional suggestions based on similar considerations. Agents responsible for correctly guessing information of interest for particular users become more infl uential during subsequent Card evaluations. For example, Transformation Agent A might consider Card 1 of high relevance for a particular user while Transformation Agent B and C consider Card 2 of high relevance. The user is subsequently presented with Card 2 ahead of Card 1. If the user copies Card 2 then the infl uence of Transformation Agent A increases. The infl uence of Transformation Agent A can continue to increase during subsequent iterations and eventually become more infl uential than the combined infl uence of Transformation Agent B and C. Any change to the infl uence of a Transformation Agent can also affect the infl uence of one or more Interpretations Agents (an implementation currently under development). For example, if a Transformation Agent prioritizes Cards based on relationships between Cards in the database then its rewards are shared with the Interpretations Agents responsible for establishing these relationships. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> presents a basic scenario that illustrates the EWall concept in the context of a remote collaborative sense-making activity. The scenario does not highlight the complexity involved in the simultaneous operation of multiple agents but only introduces a simplifi ed example that demonstrates how the organization and collaborative use of Cards affects the selection and prioritization of Cards. Because the effectiveness of the agent system increases with the number of users as well as the amount of Cards and relationships in the database, the selection and prioritization of Cards in this small scenario is not optimal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">APPLICATION</head><p>The scenario displays user, database and agent activities over time (columns A-F). Incremental changes are displayed in red. Rows 5-8 visualize particular aspect of the database contents as a basis for the Transformation Agents to determine task-relevant information (Cards) for particular users.</p><p>Row 5 displays all newly created Cards and all Cards used by more than one user in the database. The string of characters next to each Card indicates a Card's current users in chronological order. For example, cell 5B indicates the use of Card 1 by user A and D, and the use of Card 2 by user A, C and D. This particular information is used to investigate the authorship history, usage, popularity and activity of individual Cards.</p><p>Row 6 displays the emergent network of relationships among Cards in the database as determined by the Interpretation Agents. Every relationship represents an implicit (e.g. spatial proximity or orthogonal alignment) or explicit (e.g. bounding box or rubber line) association between two Cards on a Workspace. The database combines the Cards and relationships from the Workspaces of all collaborating users. Our current implementation additionally distinguishes between dynamic and static relationships. Dynamic relationships refl ect the current state of the database and are reevaluated after every event. Static relationships are established once and never change or expire but only accumulate over time. Thus, the sum of all static relationships represents a database's history or long-term memory while the sum of all dynamic relationships represents a database's current state or short-term memory. Row 7 displays the total number of interactions among users. An interaction is registered whenever a user copies a Card from another user. The results are displayed in a matrix with row and column headings displaying the names of users and the cells indicating the total number of interactions between users. Our current implementation additionally registers interactions whenever two users communicate through a Card's instant messaging feature and whenever an Interpretation Agent generates a relationship between two Cards created by different authors. Furthermore, our software prototype visualizes the total number of interactions between users with different shades of red color and automatically organizes rows and columns so as to place heavily interacting users near each other <ref type="figure">(Figure 7</ref>). This particular visualization is inspired by research in social networking <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19]</ref> and supposed to help Transformation Agents determine shared user foci and interests, as well as to help users determine possible team arrangements for the resolution of sub-tasks.</p><p>Row 8 displays with a line graph the difference between the total number of Cards and relationships over time. A small number of relationships and many Cards indicate a less structured and more arbitrary arrangement of Cards (high graph). A large number of relationships and few Cards indicate a well organized and structured arrangement of Cards (low graph). An unstructured arrangement of Cards is more typical during the beginning of a sense-making session when people primarily focus on exploring and collecting information. A structured arrangement of Cards is more typical during the end of a sense-making session when people conclude their analyses and organization of information. This particular visualization may be used to monitor progress during sense-making sessions as well as to recognize situations that allow for a broader exploration of issues or situations that suggest a more focused investigation. Our current software prototype complements this visualization with a time scale <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 8</ref>).</p><p>Rows 9-13 display the suggested selection and order of Cards by individual Transformation Agents. Some agents offer a common selection and order of Cards applicable to all users (all) while other agents offer specifi c suggestions for individual users (A-D). Due to graphical constraints the illustration only displays the fi rst four Card suggestions for each user (P1-P4).</p><p>Row 9 displays a prioritization of Cards by popularity. The Card popularity is determined by the number of people that are currently using a Card (compare row 5). For example, cell 9B shows a higher priority for Card 2 than for Card 1 because Card 2 is used on three Workspaces while Card 1 is only used on two Workspaces. This prioritization helps to promote commonly used Cards as well as to converge the individual investigations of users.</p><p>Row 10 displays a prioritization of Cards by centrality. The Card centrality is determined by the number of relationships a Card has with other Cards in database (compare row 6). For example, cell 10C shows Card 5 ahead of Card 3 because Card 5 is connected to two other Cards while Card 3 is only connected to one other Card (see cell 6C). This prioritization helps to promote Cards that appear to be predominant in the organization and collaborative use of Cards. Row 11 displays a prioritization of Cards by relevance. The Card relevance is determined by the number of relationships between a Card in the database and a Card on a Workspace. In other words, the Card relevance indicates the number of relationships between a Card that the user is not using and a Card the user is using. For example, user A might position Card 1 and 2 next to each other on his/her Workspace prompting one of the Interpretation Agents to create a relationship between the two Cards. If user B were to copy Card 1 to his/her Workspace then the priority of Card 2 for user B would increase. This prioritization helps users to detect potentially relevant Cards in the database based on the contextual use of information by different people.</p><p>Row 12 displays a prioritization of Cards by user interactions (compare row 7). Cards are prioritized based on how many interactions the Card recipients have with the Card authors. For example, if user A previously copied a Card from user B then he/she would be more likely to receive promotions for other Cards created by user B. Our current implementation additionally considers indirect interactions. For example, if one interaction occurred between user A and B as well as one interaction between user B and C then one indirect interaction is assumed between user A and C. The reasoning for this is that user A might have shared information with user B that subsequently user B shared with user C. Alternatively, user B might have shared information independently with user A and C. This prioritization is designed based on the assumption that the network of people interacting with each other indicates groups of users with potentially common foci, interests and work tasks. The analysis of direct and indirect interactions not only enables our Transformation Agents to provide users with potentially task-relevant information but also to make users aware of other users that might have similar interests, that might be experts on subjects of current consideration, or that might benefi t from a direct collaboration.</p><p>Row 13 displays an experimental prioritization of Cards that is based on the user's levels of exploration. The level of exploration is determined by the orderliness and modifi cation frequency of Card arrangements (compare row 8). The goal is to encourage individual users to be broad and explorative at the beginning of a sense-making session and increasingly focused and organized during the end of a sense-making session. For example, if, at the beginning of a sense-making session, the Card arrangement of a particular user is very organized and only slowly receives new additions then this user is presented with contributions by other users whose Card arrangements are less organized or rapidly accumulate new information.</p><p>The prioritized lists of Cards by the various Transformation Agents are combined and displayed in the Kiosk windows of individual users (gray areas in rows 1-4). In this scenario, the solution of every Transformation Agent is equally considered. For example, if one agent suggests a Card to be displayed in the second position and another agent in the fourth position then the Card will be placed in the third position. Our current implementation additionally provides functionality to increase the infl uence of Interpretation Agents that succeeded in correctly guessing information of interest to particular users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper we introduced a computational environment (EWall) for people to engage in the visual organization of information through the spatial arrangement and modifi cation of graphical objects (Cards). We further outlined the mechanics for computational agents to infer from spatial information arrangements and the collaborative use of information as a means to automate the information exchange among collaborating users (indirect collaboration). Our computational environment may be used for conducting sensemaking activities, for monitoring and investigating sense-making activities, and for developing and testing computational agents that support sense-making activities. The primary contribution of our work lies in outlining opportunities for a non-interruptive interchange of contextual discoveries between humans and computers during sense-making activities.</p><p>Our computational environment has evolved over many years in direct response to particular military needs and applications with primary focus on command and control collaboration. Our research objectives are currently shifting from the development of our computational environment to the investigation of cognitive and collaborative sense-making processes with the goal of developing, implementing and testing a signifi cant number of additional computational agents. Furthermore, we started to experiment with a variety of alternative options for adjusting the infl uence of individual agents such as, for example, through the application of genetic algorithms, neural networks, and autonomous agent negotiation techniques. We also collaborate with other research teams that test and evaluate the use of our computational environment for various applications and collaborative settings such as network-centric operations, matrix organizations, cross-organizational collaboration, distributed problem solving, and peer-to-per learning.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Workspace window (below) and Kiosk window (above)</figDesc></figure>

Rows 5-8 offer different visualizations of the database contents. Rows 9-13 display the suggested selection and order of Cards for particular users as determined by fi ve different Transformation Agents. The individual suggestions are converged and displayed in the Kiosk windows of individual users. Rows 1-4 show incremental changes to the contents in the Workspace windows (white) and Kiosk windows (gray) of four collaborating users (users A-D) over time. Cards are represented as small rectangles with unique numerical identifi ers (Cards 1-14). We may imagine that the four users collaborate on an intelligence analysis task and initially work individually on collecting and organizing task-relevant information based on their unique areas of expertise. A prioritized selection of potentially relevant Cards created by team mates is displayed in the Kiosk windows of every individual analyst. The goal is to keep individual analysts informed about what their colleagues are working and focusing on without interrupting their own investigations. The individual analysts can (yet are no required to) review Cards in their Kiosk windows and copy Cards from their Kiosk windows to their Workspace windows. The scenario shows individual analysts operating with different sets of Cards, arrange Cards in different ways, and occasionally copy Cards from their Kiosk windows to their Workspace windows. For example, cells 1A and 3A show user A and C creating one Card each on their Workspaces that instantly become visible in the Kiosk windows of all other users. Cells 1B and 4B show user A and D coping Cards from their Kiosk windows to their Workspace windows.</figDesc></figure>
