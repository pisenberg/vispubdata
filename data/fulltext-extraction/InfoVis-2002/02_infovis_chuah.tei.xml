				<p>Since the crash of the dot.coms, investors have gotten a lot more careful with where they place their money [3]. Now more than ever it becomes really important for venture capitalists (VCs) to monitor the state of the startups market and continually update their investment strategy to suit the rapidly changing market conditions. This paper presents three new visualization metaphors (Spiral Map, TimeTicker, and Double Histogram) for monitoring the startups market. While we are focusing on the VC domain, the visual metaphors developed are general and can be easily applied to other domains.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>We present three new visual metaphors to help track activity within the VC market and help uncover trends or strategies that can help VC firms make more effective investment decisions. Our analysis of the VC domain is based on a data set of startups, VC firms, and VC investments from VentureOne <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. Our dataset contains domestic startups and investments from VC firms that are over 1 million in value, starting from the first quarter of 1994. Only investments from venture capital firms are included. Angel funding and development funding (i.e. funding from existing businesses, such as Intel or Microsoft) are excluded. Finally, we only focus on startups that IPOed between first quarter of 1994 and third quarter of 2000. We chose to consider only IPOed startups because they have obvious measures of success and performance that are publicly available (e.g. market capitalization, revenues, growth, and profits).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Monitoring Investment Flows (SpiralMap)</head><p>One of the most important tasks in venture investing is to monitor the investment flows within the startups market. This will give VC firms a good real-time view of what their competitors are doing, which industries are flourishing, which industries are reaching saturation, and whether there is any advantage to being first within the area (first mover advantage).</p><p>The SpiralMap in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> shows this information. It represents a three level hierarchy of industry groups used by VentureOne to categorize startups. Each industry is represented by an oval. The oval position and text color indicate the industry group to which it belongs (e.g. ovals on the top-left corner with green names belong to the healthcare industry group). The color of the oval represents average investment in that industry. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> uses a green color scale where highly funded industries (e.g., industry-2B) are shown in bright green and less funded industries are shown in black. Currently the industry ovals are used as a grouping mechanism to indicate which sub-industries belong to which industries, as such, their size do not correspond to any data encoding.</p><p>Each industry contains a set of sub-industries that are represented by squares within the ovals. The color of a square indicates the average investment within the subindustry. Finally each sub-industry square contains a set of smaller squares each of which represents a startup. The color of each small square represents the total investments within a startup company. The startup squares are organized in a spiral pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Squares at the center or inner portions of the spiral are the older startups (i.e. startups that acquired seed investments or first round investments at an earlier time period) while squares at the tail or outer portions of the spiral are younger startups (i.e. startups that acquired investments at a later time period). This organization is important because it will show us whether startups that penetrated the industry at an earlier date have an advantage over the latecomers or vice versa (first mover advantage).</p><p>The SpiralMap display can also be used to mine for whitespace. Whitespace are industries or sub-industries that are successful but relatively poorly invested in. These are the areas that were unanticipated by the investment community and will yield the most significant returns on investment because they are highly profitable, and yet the profits are divided over a smaller number of investment dollars. The yellow highlights in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> indicate the top 20% of startups with the highest market capitalization during IPO day. We are using market capitalization here as a simple indication of startup success. Thus the subindustry squares with a lot of yellow are the sub-industries with many startup successes. Whitespace therefore are those sub-industries with relatively low average investments (i.e. black in color) with a lot of yellow dots (e.g., whitespace-1, whitespace-2, and whitespace-3).</p><p>Sub-industry1, sub-industry2, sub-industry3, and sub-industry4 all within the industry-2B, may have high startup success rates (many yellow dots), but they also have relatively high average investment numbers (bright green backgrounds) and as a result are less profitable.</p><p>There is a time slider at the bottom of the spiralMap interface that allows users to view how the investment flows are changing through time. We can also tell how different industries and sub-industries are growing by looking at the size of the spirals. Fast and rapid growth, combined with relative low initial investments indicates low barriers to entry, while a slow-down in growth would indicate that an industry is reaching its saturation point. Thus far we have shown average investment figures but we could easily encode total investment or other relevant attributes.</p><p>Our SpiralMap display shows similar hierarchical financial data as the SmartMoney map <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref> that was originally derived from TreeMaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The SpiralMap display, however, is unique in that it integrates several key data features that are crucial in our VC investing domain:</p><p>• Spiral organization encodes first mover advantage:</p><p>The spiral organization of startup companies within a sub-industry allows us to quickly determine whether there is any advantage to being the first to penetrate an industry by focusing on whether the center of the spirals contain bright dots. SpiralMap display, size of the sub-industry squares encodes the number of startups within it. This shows how saturated a sub-industry is, as well as indicates the rate of growth (when used together with the time slider). Both these features are important to our domain. In contrast it is more difficult to see how crowded an industry is using the SmartMoney map because each company square has a different size.</p><p>The two main weaknesses of the SpiralMap display are 1) it is not space-filing and therefore does not utilize space as efficiently as the SmartMoney map, and 2) only a single continuous data attribute (e.g. total investments) can be shown at any one time. The SmartMoney map can display two continuous attributes simultaneously through size and color.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Monitoring VC performance over time (Timelines &amp; Time Ticker)</head><p>It is important to track the performance of different VC firms and identify broader investment strategies that are effective on a group or portfolio level. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, we are comparing the performance of the top 30 largest VC firms in terms of total money invested, using timelines. Each line represents a VC firm. The x-axis represents time, in particular, it represents days-after-IPO. The y-axis represents performance of the VC firms as represented by the total returns per dollar of their portfolio. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows that timelines are useful when comparing a small number of objects but become difficult to interpret when comparing more than about five to ten objects due to overcrowding.</p><p>In order to compare many VC firms simultaneously we designed a new visual metaphor: the timeTicker. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> is an example timeTicker representation of the 30 companies shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>. The timeTicker represents each VC firm by a line. Each line is divided into multiple time segments. Each time segment is filled in based on how well a VC firm is performing at that particular time. In addition to using the segment length to represent VC firm performance, we can also doubly encode the same information using segment saturation. I.e. bright green encodes strong VC firm performance and black encodes weak VC firm performance. The timeTicker representation allows each of the VC firms to be viewed much more accurately, and in much greater detail than in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>. Unlike the timelines display, we can easily pick out the very poor performers (these are the lines with many thin and dark bars) such as VC firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">10,</ref><ref type="bibr">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">19,</ref><ref type="bibr">21,</ref><ref type="bibr">22,</ref><ref type="bibr">23,</ref><ref type="bibr">25</ref>; the mid-level performers (these are the lines with many dark green and medium length bars) such as VC firm 9, 18, 20, 29; and the good performers (these are the lines with many bright green, and long bars) such as VC firm 26, 27. We can also easily pick out the firms with unusual performance patterns such as VC firm 1 which performs well at first and then languishes towards the end; VC firm 8 which performs badly at first, but significantly improves towards the end; or VC firm 30 which has a cyclic trend.</p><p>In the timeTicker display, we are only comparing relative performances, i.e. how well a firm is doing at any one time compared to all the other encoded firms during that given time stamp. It is also possible to use an absolute scale, but that may result in dwarfing problems on the lengths of the timestamp bars. Note that comparing a data attribute (e.g. VC firm performance) across a large number of data objects (e.g. VC firms) over a given period of time is a very common problem that arises in many tasks across many different domains (e.g., managing portfolios in the stock market).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Monitoring VC success with respect to their size (Double Histogram)</head><p>In this section we examine whether large or small firms end up having greater success. For this purpose we designed the double histogram visualization <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 4)</ref>. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> we represent the size (total money invested) distribution of VC firms with a histogram. The large firms are represented on the right of the x-axis and the small firms are represented on the left of the x-axis. The heights of the bars represent the number of VC firms that fall into a given range of total investment as represented by the black bars. In our double histogram display, each black bar that constitutes the regular histogram contains a subhistogram (yellow bars). Specifically, each black bar is divided into a set of rows, each of which represents a VC firm. This VC firm line may be partially colored yellow depending on which startups are currently selected (this is similar to the SeeSoft system <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> we have selected all the startups with low market capitalization on their IPO date (i.e. the less successful startups). The VC firm lines are colored based on what percentage of a firm's startup portfolio is in the selected startups set. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows that the least successful startups (colored yellow) mostly occupy the leftmost bars, indicating that the smaller firms have a greater risk of failure.</p><p>Note that this correlation between size of VC firm and portfolio success can also be explored using a scatter-plot. However, the scatter-plot display can sometimes contain a high degree of occlusion depending on the distribution of values of the two data attributes being compared. In addition, the scatter-plot display does not readily show the number of firms that fall within each total-investment segment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper we developed three novel visualizations (spiralMap, timeTicker, and double histogram) to analyze the VC investing domain. All the tools are linked to each other through painting <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> so that selection of objects in one display will cause corresponding objects in the other displays to get highlighted as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SpiralMap:</head><p>The SpiralMap display tracks the flow of investments into different startups and industries so that VCs may keep track of the "hot" plays on a daily basis: i) "First mover advantage": Determine whether early penetration in an industry leads to greater success. ii) Industry growth: Monitor the size of an industry in terms of the number of startups currently within it. A higher growth rate may indicate lower barriers to entry and vice versa. iii) "Saturation point": Determine the number of startups an industry can comfortably support. iv) "Whitespace": Determine the whitespaces, or areas of success that may not be widely apparent.</p><p>TimeTicker: The timeTicker display monitors the success of VC firms by showing portfolio performance, over time.</p><p>The strength of the timeTicker display is that it allows many VC firms to be compared simultaneously unlike traditional timeline displays. This method is more generally applicable to a large variety of domains including stock portfolio management, sales tracking of different product lines through time, or customer tracking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DoubleHistogram (Histogram 2 ):</head><p>Unlike traditional histograms, the double histogram allows us to explore the relationships between multiple attributes. For example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> we are exploring the relationship between the market capitalization of startups and the total investment of VC firms that contain those startups within their portfolio. The double histogram is most useful when there is too much occlusion in the scatter-plot representation of the same data, or when it is important to be able to retrieve object counts based on a data attribute.</p><p>Note that the data set we analyzed may contain errors, and may be incomplete as stated in section 1. In addition, market conditions may change and these may alter the results that are discussed here. It is precisely for this reason that the visualization tools presented in this paper should be used on a regular basis with updated, real-time data so that the strategy models used by VC firms can be quickly updated to suit changing market conditions.</p><p>In the future we plan to link quantitative data to more qualitative information such as how the management team within startups, and how the relationships between people and products can affect company success. We believe that qualitative data feeds can provide external context that may explain particular quantitative changes.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>•</head><label></label><figDesc>Fixed startup positions: the size and therefore positions of startups are fixed over time. This allows us to easily see changing trends through time on a startup, sub-industry, and industry level.

Thus the size and position of companies change from one time slice to another based on changes in the data attribute encoded.• Aggregate figures at a sub-industry and industry level are shown: The display shows detailed information about each startup simultaneously with aggregated figures of their parent sub-industry and industry.
