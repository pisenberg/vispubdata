				<p>Data-mining of information by the process of pattern discovery in protein sequences has been predominantly algorithm based. In this paper we discuss a visualization approach, which uses texture mapping and blending techniques to perform visual data-mining on text data obtained from discovering patterns in protein sequences. This visual approach, investigates the possibilities of representing text data in three dimensions and provides new possibilities of representing more dimensions of information in text data visualization and analysis. We also present a generic framework derived from this visualization approach to visualize text in biosequence data.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Data-mining is the non-trivial process of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable information in data. Data-mining approaches can be classified as algorithm driven or visualization driven <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In some cases the data-mining process is a combination of both algorithmic and visualization approaches.</p><p>One of the interesting problems in biological data analysis is the discovery and analysis of sub-sequences known as patterns common to a given collection of related biosequences (protein or DNA). Discovering patterns common to a given set of sequences is an NP-Hard problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Recently, there have been efficient algorithms (Teiresias <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Splash <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and Tuppleware <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>) developed for discovering patterns in sequence datasets. These algorithms use intelligent heuristics to discover patterns of interest in computationally efficient time. A review of these algorithms and the current trends are presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Once the patterns are discovered, they can be used to search for their occurrence in un-annotated sequences to annotate them <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> or perform structural studies to understand their possible significance in the chemical structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Analyzing the distribution of patterns in a sequence with respect to other sequences, can give valuable insights into the underlying sequence. At present we are not aware of a precise definition to this problem of identifying outliers in a distribution of patterns. Developing algorithms to perform data-mining without such a precise definition is not possible. Applications like MAST <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and PATMATCH <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> use 2D visualization approaches to solve this problem and present the data to a user for visual analysis.</p><p>In this paper we demonstrate the use of a simple, yet powerful 3D model for visualizing pattern discovery data in protein sequences. Section 2 describes the nature of the data related to pattern discovery and presents more information on the related applications and the motivation for our design. Section 3 presents our visualization model and associated interaction techniques. Section 4 presents the implementation details. Section 5 presents some analysis related issues and results. Section 6 presents several observations about the properties of biosequences and the motivation behind designing a framework for visualizing biosequences. Section 7 presents a framework for presenting biosequence data in three dimensions. Finally, we present our conclusions and directions for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Pattern Discovery Data</head><p>In general a biological sequence S (amino acid or nucleic acid) of length n(n &gt; 0) is typically of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S = [A 1 , A 2 ...A n ]</formula><p>where A i belongs to a finite size alphabet set. In the case of proteins the alphabet set size is 20, representing the different amino acids, and in the case of DNA or RNA sequences, it is 4, representing the different base pairs. Two short DNA sequences with alphabet set [A, T, G, C] are S 1 = AT GGGACT CCT T CC S 2 = GAT GT GAT AT T CT CC</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Typical 2D representation</head><p>Depending on the algorithm, the syntax of the pattern obtained can vary. One general syntax as given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> of a pattern P of biological interest is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P = [A ∪ '.' ] * A</formula><p>where, A is one of the symbols belonging to the alphabet set and '.' represents a don't care condition, which means any single alphabet symbol can occur in that position. Patterns should occur in two or more sequences and should be of length at least two alphabets long. They may also overlap one another. Two examples of patterns occurring in the above set of example sequences are</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P 1 = T G..A.T P 2 = CT CC</formula><p>The input to a pattern discovery algorithm is a set of sequences S i . The output obtained is a set of patterns P i . Some algorithms provide the offsets of the occurrence of patterns in the set of sequences. In cases where it does not, we can use simple string matching algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> to generate the offset locations. The offset list L i for a pattern P i , discovered in a set of k sequences and offset lists for the patterns P 1 and P 2 are</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L[P i ] = [(S j ,offset ij ), (S j , offset ij ) ... ] where j ∈ [1..k] L[P 1 ] = [(S 1 , 2), (S 2 , 5)] L[P 2 ] = [(S 1 , 8), (S 1 , 12), (S 2 , 11), (S 2 , 13)]</formula><p>The number of unique sequences in which a pattern occurs is called the level of support of the pattern in the given sequence set. The subset of the sequence which matches a given pattern is called the matching sub-sequence element. Pattern discovery data is therefore, a set of sequences S j , a set of patterns P i and an offset list L i for each pattern. This data is the input for our visual data-mining application -PATTVision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Related Visualization applications</head><p>As mentioned before, there are simple applications like MAST and PATMATCH to visualize pattern discovery data. Typically, these applications use simple visualization models such as rectangular color bars representing a sequence and sub-rectangles of different colors showing different patterns as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> (patterns shown in the figure follow different grammar than discussed).</p><p>These applications are based on 2D and have some disadvantages. Due to the nature of these models, the user needs to spend some time in referencing the color legends showing the patterns. Some of these models do not allow the text symbols to be shown, often a requirement when studying proteins. These models do not support global+local magnification <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, thereby resulting in more navigational difficulties. Manipulation of the data representation based on real-time user interactions is also not possible. An example of data manipulation would be aligning the sequences based on a single pattern to observe the distribution of other patterns across different sequences ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, which is explained in detail in Sections 3 &amp; 5).</p><p>The applications discussed so far are developed to be light weight processes, with the objective of presenting a quick visual representation of the data at the end of a pattern discovery process. Therefore, they have the mentioned disadvantages. Once the patterns are available, most datamining approaches attempt to use automatic methods to solve large scale sequence annotation problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. An analyst interested to study specific problems or families of proteins needs a much more versatile platform for their study of pattern discovery data. PATTVision has been developed to addresses this need to perform interactive visualization and data manipulations on pattern discovery data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Visualization Model</head><p>The basic visualization model used for data mining in PATTVision is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . The model consists of a horizontal plane of amino acid sequences. Each sequence is rendered in a straight line along the length of the plane (X-axis). Individual sequences are parallel to each other on the plane (Y-axis). The model represents a rectangular grid across the plane with different sequences on one axis and the sequence represented by its alphabets on the other. Pattern match sites on the sequences in the plane are highlighted using different colors. They show the matching subsequence element of the sequence, which matches the given pattern. Each pattern is represented by a different color.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Y-Axis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>X-Axis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Z-Axis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2. Visualization Model of PATTVision</head><p>The number of patterns shown is limited to a selected set of patterns, which can be changed interactively.</p><p>The default coloring of the alphabets in a sequence is set to grey with alpha values making them semi-transparent. This allows the user to visualize the characters behind one another when they overlap at different points after projection ( <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). The pattern locations need to be highlighted in the data so their alpha values are set to make them opaque. This gives the effect of fading out the regions in which patterns do not occur and highlighting the more important pattern match sites. For all viewing transformations applied on the plane of sequences, each sequence face (X &amp; Z-axis) is rotated to remain parallel to the view plane. This results in the alphabets always facing the user in a readable manner irrespective of the point of projection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Blending Planes</head><p>An important part of the model is the use of blending planes to highlight information. They are placed above the pattern locations with additional information as their height. Currently their height represents their level of support in the dataset. This can also be used to represent other dimensions such as search scores. The blending planes appears as quads because the value of level of support, is constant across the length of the matching sub-sequence. At the top of the blending plane, the pattern matching at that site below the blending plane is displayed. This eliminates the need to refer to color indexes to find the pattern. Optionally, this display can also be turned off, showing only the blending plane ( <ref type="figure">Figure 3)</ref>.</p><p>The model in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the data set aligned on a single pattern. The align operation on a pattern shifts the sequences individually along their X-axes so that the pattern match site of the sequences occurs along the same crosssection of the grid. Sequences that do not contain the pattern are left undisturbed. This is useful to study the distribution of other patterns across the sequence set with respect to a single pattern.</p><p>Often two or more patterns overlap in a part of a sequence. Blending planes are useful in showing these patterns which overlap. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the overlap of three patterns in the same part of a sequence in the dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Interaction</head><p>The navigation is similar to a track-ball interface with zoom and pan control. The perspective projection+zoom option provides a bird's eye view of the dataset and helps the user to locate interesting characteristics shown by the data. The zoom interface is continuous in nature allowing the user to shrink and expand the model as necessary. In the bird's eye view the user is looking for the distribution of colors across the plane. In this view, the rendering of the blending planes is turned off to facilitate the view of the pattern distribution based only on color. Though the data shrinks to incomphrenhensible levels when showing a bird's eye view, we still continue to maintain the rendering in text form because it is more natural to see the text appear more clearer when zooming out. We also experimented using level-of-detail reduction operators such as bounding boxes with colored regions to replace the text when some point in the bird's eye view was reached. The feedback from the users suggested the use of the first approach. Optionally, the user can also switch to orthogonal projection and use clipping planes to slice through data. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Implementation</head><p>The rendering engine in PATTVision was developed using OpenGL. The widgets were generated using the XForms <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> library. The complete screen-shot of the application is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref>. The design and components used in the development were targeted to be portable across multiple platforms. We currently have successful implementations in Solaris, IRIX and Linux.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Texture Mapping</head><p>We use texture mapping for rendering the large set of text data. The use of stroked fonts was not considered due to the excessive geometry it adds to the scene. Bitmaps are a possible way for rendering text in a scene, but since graphics API's like OpenGL do not scale and process bitmaps in the same way as the other primitives, they were not used. To achieve the text rendering, one or more quads are drawn along the length of a sequence and textures drawn with text are pasted on the quads. This drastically reduced the geometry in the scene and allowed for the drawing of large sets of text. The textures were generated using a 8x13 font definition set. Texture Mapping also allows for the graphics hardware to do the expensive operations of blending and anti-aliasing, thus aiding in real-time visuals.</p><p>The interaction with the model requires turning on/off specific pattern coloring. This can be achieved only by changing the texture contents. If a pattern is turned off, the color of the text in the texture needs to be grey, and alpha values need to be semi-transparent. If a pattern is turned on, the text in the texture needs to be colored to the appropriate texture color, and alpha values need to be changed to make it appear opaque. This has been implemented using OpenGL's sub-texture replacement functions.</p><p>Currently, commodity graphics cards have around 16MB or more of texture memory. The available OpenGL features and extensions enable these cards to render in realtime large datasets of around 50 sequences or more with each sequences around 1KB long. Most of the development and testing was carried out on a PC equipped with Nvidia Geforce class graphics card having 32MB texture memory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Blending</head><p>For blending purposes, the color properties of the texture image completely replaces the color properties of the underlying polygon. This method is similar to drawing a bitmap. The final blended image was accomplished by sorting the primitives back to front and drawing them using the blending available in hardware using OpenGL calls. Since currently available generic systems have graphics hardware which support blending and texture mapping directly, our implementation provides real-time performance on most systems. When compiled for software based rendering, there was significant reduction in frame-rate because of the expensive operations associated with texture mapping and blending.</p><p>PATTVision is used to visually guide users to areas of interest in the dataset. The operation of aligning sequences based on a pattern is novel and useful, as it provides a visual of the relative distribution of other patterns. The aligning problem is non-trivial because of two issues. First, in sequences that do contain the exact pattern it may be better to align based on a different pattern which is similar. But, the problem of defining what is similar complicates the issue. Second, in cases where more than one occurrence of the pattern occurs in a given sequence, it is again complicated to determine which one is biologically significant and should be used. In spite of these issues the trivial solution we use, which is aligning based only on the pattern presence and first occurrence in the sequence works well for most cases.</p><p>We have made an assumption in the basic visual model of PATTVision that the regions of interest are shown by patterns discovered. There are cases where this is not true, for example a divergent motif that covers non-contiguous bases or amino acids may be critical for function. In order to address some part of this problem and perform further analysis of pattern distributions we are working on developing a theory of meta-patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>The concept of meta-pattern works by visually identifying and forming a complex pattern using the discovered patterns and relationships between them. The relationship can be a particular order : P 1 follows P 2 , fixed distance : P 1 is separated from P 2 by a fixed number of amino acids and variable distance : P 1 is separated from P 2 by a range of amino acids. For our discussion let us assume the relationship of fixed distance. In this case the syntax of the meta-pattern M will be,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">M = [P i ∪ '.'] * P j (i, j ∈ 1..n)</formula><p>where, n is the number of discovered patterns in the sequence dataset. An example of a meta-pattern M 1 formed by using two patterns related by a fixed distance of 4 base pairs in sequences S 1 and S 2 is</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">S 1 = AT GGGACT CCT T T CC S 2 = GAT GT GAT AT T T ACCT CC M 1 = T G..A.T . . . . T CC</formula><p>where, T G..A.T and T CC are individual patterns. For this particular case of fixed distance relationship, the metapattern is essentially a pattern which can be automatically discovered by Teiresias. The concept of meta-pattern in this case may appear to be redundant but, in case studies developed by us the fixed distance is sometimes quite large (30 or more). The change in parameters (number of amino <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Meta-Pattern present in Alpha-2 Adrenergic receptors acids and the width) required to discover such long patterns results in a large increase in the polynomial <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> computational complexity required to discover them in the first place. Visually identifying them is more practical. Thus we make a distinction between the fixed distance relationship meta-pattern and the generic pattern.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L.....DR DRY A....L...L LA....L...L</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>L-A-X(1)-A-D-I-L-V-A-T-L-X(38)-L-C-A-I-S-L-D-R-Y</head><p>Currently meta-patterns can be only discovered visually. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been used in the past to model protein families based on patterns discovered in them <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Similarly, HMMs can be used to model some properties of meta-patterns. This is a possible future study. In our studies, we were able to generate metapatterns that have been shown to produce accurate query results in searches to protein sequence databases. For example, in one of our study, we used Teiresias to generate patterns from a protein sequence dataset of 44 G-Protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) containing the different subfamilies. Among the discovered patterns we were able to visually identify two pairs of patterns separated by a fixed distance of 38 amino acids from each other in a subset of 4 sequences that belonged to Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. We used this information along with some visual filling in of don't cares forming a simple meta-pattern shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. This meta-pattern matched exactly 29 of 31 Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in SWISSPROT <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, out of more than 90,000 total amino acid sequences. However, the metapattern theory is still in early stages of development and cannot yet be applied to general datasets.</p><p>One additional functionality in the visualization model is the use of color encoding combined with alphabets to show substitution groups. The different groups; acid, base, polar, aromatic and hydrophobic can be represented by encoding color on amino acids as shown in the <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. When used in conjunction with the align operation, it is useful to observe how amino acid replacements occur across the sequence family under study.</p><p>It is possible to develop a 2D viewer that can perform most of the operations of PATTVision. But, the real advantage in PATTVision is the interactivity it provides and the more possibilities to show other dimensions of interest clearly by modifying blending planes or adding other primitives. One other issue we need to discuss is the use of <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Substitution Mode symbolic character encoding schemes to represent the text dataset. While this is standard in information visualization models, the current problem we are addressing requires 20 symbols to be presented in a manner that the user can grasp quickly. Symbolic encoding schemes aim to visually compress the data and can make the model more complicated to use. So we decided to use direct text rendering, which keeps the visuals simple and adequately serves our purpose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>Biosequences can be divided into two types, amino acid sequences and nucleic acid sequences. Typically, scientists do not visualize information in textual form in the case of genomic (or nuclei acid) sequences. Large and direct visualization of genomic sequences is not required in most cases. A more typical method is to represent data in different regions than in individual residues. Examples of genomic visual data mining models can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Currently available genome viewers (with different visualization models) use 2D to represent the data. The main drawback is that the visualization models used in these viewers make representing more dimensions of information difficult. For these problems, a 3D visualization model offers much more possibilities in data representation as shown.</p><p>For a biosequence or a set of biosequences, the associated data is predominantly static. The sequence datasets are large and each sequence has a number of variables of interest associated with it. Typical analysis methods include forming hypotheses based on observation and queries to databases to refine or verify them. Given this nature of data and analysis, we can build visual datamining models based on building texture datasets to represent the static sequence data and use other primitives to add other calculated or queried data. Most approaches to biosequence visualization have not taken advantage of the advanced rendering features available in hardware today. We believe that by exploiting these features we can obtain better analysis models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Framework for biosequence visualization</head><p>The framework for visual representation of sequence data consists of two basic parts, building the dataset and interacting with the dataset. We divide the framework into two modules Data Preprocessing Module and Rendering Module.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Data Preprocessing Module</head><p>The objective of the Data Preprocessing Module is to build the dataset to be rendered. An analogy for this module is processing architectural information to obtain display primitive data for building a walk-through. In case of PATTVision (and models based on amino acids), this processing step does not take much time and can be run when the application starts. In the case of handling genomic information, this step will typically take a longer time and therefore needs to be run once offline to generate the display dataset, consisting of the texture data and primitive data. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows a functional block diagram of the data preprocessing module. The input to the module is basically the biosequence dataset and related data/information like sequence annotations. In case of PATTVision, this data is the patterns obtained from the pattern discovery process. This input is processed to obtain display primitive information (blending planes) and texture dataset. The procedure for processing and building the output is determined by the visualization model implemented in the rendering module.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Rendering Module</head><p>The rendering module performs functions associated with displaying the visual model and handling interactions from the user. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows a functional block diagram of the rendering module. The Rendering Engine performs the task of drawing into the frame buffer. The Texture Engine performs texture management functions. In our case, sophisticated texture management schemes were not necessary. While handling genomic datasets, texture data handling techniques as discussed by D. Cline et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> might need to be implemented to handle texture swapping in memory. Queries form an important part of analyzing biosequences and they are sometimes not real time operations. Sub-modules handling the queries and non-realtime operations are required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>This paper has two important contributions. We have presented a visual datamining model for analysis of data from pattern discovery. This visualization model of representing textual information in three dimensions demonstrates the flexibility and additional advantages offered over conventional 2D sequence viewers. Our discussion about the different aspects of biosequence data and its associated analysis, thereby developing a framework for implementing visual datamining applications opens new possibilities to biosequence visualization problems. Extending metapattern theory and addressing genomic visualization problems based on the framework discussed will be objectives of our future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 3.
