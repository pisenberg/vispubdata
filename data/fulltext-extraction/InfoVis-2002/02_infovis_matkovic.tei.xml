				<p>In this paper we demonstrate how we apply information visualization techniques to process monitoring. Virtual instruments are enhanced using history encoding-instruments are capable of displaying the current value and the value from the near past. Multi-instruments are capable of displaying several data sources simultaneously. Levels of detail for virtual instruments are introduced where the screen area is inversely proportional to the information amount displayed. Furthermore the monitoring system is enhanced by using: 3D anchoring-attachment of instruments to positions on a 3D model-, collision avoidancea physically based spring model prevents instruments from overlapping-, and focus+context rendering-giving the user a possibility to examine particular instruments in detail without loosing the context information.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Information visualization (InfoViz) has emerged as an important field of research in the past few years. Process visualization as one of its sub-fields is directly related, but nevertheless much older. Processes have been visualized and monitored using traditional, analog instruments since the early days of industrialization. Analog instruments were followed by the use of digital instruments, and finally, computers are increasingly used to visualize and monitor processes.</p><p>There are a lot of software tools available, offering a comfortable and intuitive way for process visualization. Most of these tools try to mimic conventional instruments, without taking advantage of well-known InfoViz methodology.</p><p>In this paper, we describe how process visualization can benefit from information visualization. We have improved features of individual instruments, as well as global monitoring features, and finally we developed two applications which illustrate the methods described in this paper.</p><p>Features added to virtual instruments are: history encoding, multi-instruments, and levels of detail (LOD).</p><p>Besides augmenting the instruments themselves, the global monitoring system was improved by adding fo-cus+context (F+C) rendering <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and collision avoidance.</p><p>The above described features will be explained in more detail using gauge, bar, LED, and numeric instruments. The bar instrument is an instrument where the length of a solid bar corresponds to the measured value. It's analog counterpart is a mercury thermometer. The LED instrument mimics a single LED and can represent two states in our case. The numeric instrument displays measured data on a numeric display as a decimal, hexadecimal, or binary number.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">New Features for Virtual Instruments</head><p>The idea of using virtual instead of classical instruments is not new. However, most of the virtual instruments try to mimic real ones, and offer a faster, more comfortable and more flexible way of arranging a new set of measuring instruments. We improve virtual instruments themselves. We make them capable of displaying the history of data (history encoding). Our virtual instruments are also able to simultaneously display several data values within one instrument, so that divergencies in redundant information are easily recognizable (multi-instruments). Finally, a LOD representation for virtual instruments is introduced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">History Encoding in Virtual Instruments</head><p>It is often important not only to read the current value of a sensor, but also to get a clue what was the value in the near past. Of course it is possible to use some kind of oscilloscope instrument or time chart, but their size is often a limiting factor. We add history encoding to the bar and gauge instrument. Such an augmented instrument takes no more place than a common bar/gauge instrument, but gives far more information to the user in a convinient and intuitive style. In the case of the bar instrument, history is encoded through horizontal lines on the left of the numerical scale. Length and saturation of a line encode the "recentness" of a value. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(a) illustrates a bar instrument without history encoding depicting just the current value. In figures 1(b)-1(d) data history is depicted.</p><p>The same idea has been applied to the gauge instrument. The history needles in the gauge instrument are reduced to the needle tips to avoid visual cluttering ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Multi-Instruments</head><p>Common practice in fault tolerant systems, e.g., planes, locomotives, modern cars, etc., is to install several sensors for the same data. Important system decisions must not be based on a single measurement alone. If a separate instrument is used for each sensor, it is very hard to see if there are any deviations in the measurements, unless one value is significantly different from the others.</p><p>In order to make it easier to visualize such cases, we introduce multi-instruments ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). The multi-bar and the multi-gauge instrument, display several distinct data sources simultaneously, but using the same scale. The multi-bar instrument uses more bars beside each other, and the multi-gauge instrument uses more needles. The needles have different length, and shorter needles are placed on top of longer needles, so that the user immediately sees all the values. If there is a deviation in the values, one (or more) not matching needle(s) will be easily spotted. Multiinstruments can also be used whenever it is necessary to visualize related data which does not have to be identical.</p><p>In order to make it easier to read the instruments, two more features are added. First a bullet on the scale indicates the current value. This is especially useful for multiinstruments where the numerical scale is not next to all bars/needles. Furthermore, an actual-value display is added.</p><p>An actual-value display shows the current value as decimal number in a numeric display. The position of the actualvalue display loosly follows the current data value by using a running average. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows a multi-bar and a multigauge instrument.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Levels of Detail</head><p>Multi-instruments have not only the advantage of making it easier to compare related values, but they save screen space as well. This led us to the next new feature in process visualization, i.e., levels of detail (LOD). An example follows: four single bar instruments are drawn at the finest level of detail, the multi-bar instrument representing the same four values represents the next lower level, a numeric instrument which displays the average value and a LED instrument are further (coarser) levels of detail. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> illustrates the example, and gives the area usage for each level (highest level = 100%). In this way, it is possible to use the LED instrument if everything is running OK, and than switch to a higher level on demand.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Focus+Context Process Visualization</head><p>The LOD idea itself leads to a Focus+Context (F+C) process visualization. The focus+context approach is a wellknown technique in information visualization. The surrounding environment, i.e., the context, makes this approach different from simple zooming-in, where an area is displayed in another scale but the connection to the environment is lost.</p><p>According to Kosara et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> the F+C methods can be divided into three groups. The first, and widest spread group of F+C methods are distortion-oriented or spatial methods. The idea is to distort the display to allow a magnification of interesting areas without losing the context which will be displayed on a coarser scale. Examples are: fisheye views <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, stretched rubber sheets <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, etc. The second group of methods are dimensional methods, which are suitable for objects with a lot of data associated with them. Objects in focus will be displayed using more dimensions of the data. An example of such a method is the magic lens <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Finally, the last group of F+C methods is called cue methods. These approaches allow the user to select objects in terms of their features, and not their spatial relations. An example is the semantic depth of field approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> which blurs different parts of the scene in dependence of their relevance.</p><p>Our idea is to use the LOD principle introduced in the previous section for our F+C approach. The degree of interest corresponds to the level of detail of the instrument. This can be considered, according to the above introduced categorization as a dimensional F+C method. Increasing the level of detail, however, increases the size of an instrument, and instrument overlapping possibly would occur. Some kind of rearrangement of the instruments should be done in this case which makes our method a spatial method too. Therefore, our approach represents a combination of a dimensional and a spatial F+C method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">3D Anchoring and Interaction, Collision Avoidance</head><p>Virtual instruments represent real measuring sensors, that are placed in a 3D environment, and send data to the system. The user positions instruments on the screen, specifying the instruments' current and desired position. Since the real sensors exist in a 3D environment, e.g., a racing car, virtual instruments could be attached to the 3D model of the real environment and then mapped to the screen. This attachment of an instrument to a 3D position of a 3D model is called anchoring. In this way, the user can immediately recognize which data is coming from which data source. The   user can rotate the 3D model, and the assigned instruments will follow the movement. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> shows an example of four instruments assigned to the four wheels of a schematic car model. In principle, anchored instruments, which follow a 3D model, often would overlap. We developed a collision avoidance system which will prevent the instruments from overlapping. The algorithm implemented <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> uses a physically based spring model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The process of automatic placement is illustrated in figure 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Focus+Context Rendering</head><p>The LOD principle and automatic instrument placement are used for focus+context rendering. The idea is to use dif-   <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Changing the degree of interest ferent levels of detail for different degrees of interest. The instruments with the highest degree of interest will be represented using the highest LOD. After a level changes it is sometimes necessary to rearrange the instruments. Automatic collision avoidance described in section 3.1 is used in such a case. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> illustrates the change of levels, and rearrangement of the instruments.</p><p>An instrument's degree of interest can be increased either explicitly or implicitly. By explicitly changing the degree of interest the user selects the instruments that are more interesting.</p><p>Implicitly changing the degree of interest is coupled with predefined, undesired system states. If an unwanted state occurs, e.g., a value exceeds a predefined range, the instrument's degree of interest is increased automatically, to notify the user and get his attention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Application and Evaluation</head><p>The principles described in this paper are implemented in a placement prototype <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and in a commercial application TTPView 3.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The placement prototype realizes fo-cus+context visualization as well as collision avoidance as described in section 3. The TTPView 3.0 application is far more complex. It is a commercial product which is intended to be used on a daily basis.</p><p>TTPView is a high-speed bus monitoring tool for the TTP system. The TTPView 3.0 is easily connected to the system, and gets all information about existing data sources from the system. The user can arrange virtual instruments and monitor the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>This paper presents several novel approaches to process visualization. We added features to the virtual instruments and we presented enhancements to the entire processvisualization workflow.</p><p>The new features added to virtual instruments can be summarized as: History encoding, which makes it possible to display the values from the near past together with the current value. Multi-instruments are capable of displaying several values simultaneously making it easier to compare redundant values. The levels-of-detail approach makes it possible to use instruments of different sizes to represent the same data.</p><p>The advanced features for virtual instruments made it possible to improve the global monitoring system by applying: The focus+context principle, which allows the user to explore particular instruments in more detail without loosing the overall context. 3D Anchoring was used to anchor instruments on the 3D model. Collision Avoidance using a physically based spring model was implemented to avoid instrument overlapping. This paper shows how InfoViz techniques can be applied to process monitoring and visualization. We did not try only to mimic the real instruments, but also to enhance them, and the whole monitoring system, as well. As a result, a system is realized which offers more information and uses not much more screen space. It also gives the user more flexibility.
