				<p>This paper describes a system for analyzing the flow of traffic through web-sites. We decomposed the general path analysis problem into a set of distinct subproblems, and created a visual metaphor for analyzing each of them. Our system works off of multiple representations of the clickstream, and exposes the path extraction algorithms and data to the visual metaphors as web services. We have combined the visual metaphors into a web-based &quot;path analysis portal&quot; that lets the user easily switch between the different modes of analysis.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Path analysis for a website is the study of how visitors navigate through the site, what content they access and how traffic flows through the site. It involves both understanding the sequences of content pages that an individual visitor accesses as well as overall aggregate traffic flows among different content groups. The sequence (path), begins at the visitor's entry point into the site, often the site home page, contains one entry for each page that the visitor accesses, and ends with the visitor's exit page. For each visitor session, or visit to the website, a path is generated. Understanding visitor paths, what content visitors access, what links users click on, and what content visitors are missing, is a critical input for designing an effective web site. The sorts of questions path analysis addresses include: Where do visitors go after visiting the products page? Can you show all paths for visitors that accessed the page for a promotion? Do the paths for visitors who arrive from a search engine differ than those who came from an email blast?</p><p>Because this problem is so important, it has been the topic of much research. Most of this has appeared in the areas of web analysis and web usage mining, addressing problems such as extracting visitors paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, surfing patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and ordering relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and prediction of the next web page for caching strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. While past research visualized the structure of web sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, our focus is instead on how users navigate sites. In contrast to previous researchers who focused on specific aspects of path analysis, our approach is to partition path analysis into a set of related issues and build an interactive visual toolkit that addresses each issue individually. We call our toolkit the "Path Analysis Portal." Our toolkit combines unique presentation metaphors with path analysis algorithms. The visual metaphors are integrated in the portal to provide a rich environment for interactive path analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Organizing Path Data</head><p>Broadly speaking there are three classes of data that come together for path analysis. Page View Sequences: are the sequence of pages visited by the user in a session. This is often referred to as the visitor's clickstream. Site Content and Content Groups: involves the actual material on each page and how the pages are arranged within the site. The vast majority of sites follow an approximately hierarchical structure. For example, the top-levels of hierarchy within a company site be shown in a nested list as (Products (Widgets, Grommets), Company, Employment, ...). It is common for most sites to we have about 5-10 content groups at each layer in the hierarchy. Individual pages are mapped to these specific content groups. Other content categories can be defined using methods such as URL parsing or Content Management Systems that define the content structure apriori. Visit Attributes: are associated with each session, and include: visit duration, referring url, date and time, browser type, entry page, exit page, visitor type.</p><p>At first glance, collecting path data may appear to be easy <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. There are, however, many subtle issues that complicate data collection. These involve accurate sessionization, handling sites with dynamic content, multiple browser windows, etc. Details of these issues are beyond the scope of this paper. We have built a robust back-end data collection system that we used for our analysis. It extracts paths from log files, performs sessionization, and stores the result in a relational store. From this store, multidimensional and hierarchical OLAP cubes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> are produced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Presentation Metaphors and Algorithms</head><p>In this section we describe a number of path presentation metaphors and discuss the problems that they address. we have found that no single presentation metaphor is suitable for answering all of the types of questions that a user is likely to ask about paths. As such, our focus has been on the creation of a suite of lightweight presentations that can be easily manipulated and understood by the user. The presentations make extensive use of animation to show the progression of time-varying flows through the web site(s). All of the metaphors are linked together, thus allowing the user to switch between them easily. Behind each metaphor is a web service that computes the required paths and sends the result to the presentation client via XML. A common feature of our metaphors is the ability to easily toggle between showing absolute traffic flows, and flow differences over time or some other attribute.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Funnel Chart dropouts on a sequence of pages.</head><p>Funnel analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> is a technique to find dropout rates along a designated sequence of pages. For the website designer, the intent is that visitors are supposed to access a designated sequence of pages such as completing the steps in a buying pipeline. By analyzing dropout rates site key problem areas can be identified. We have created a dynamic funnel chart that can be easily attached to any HTML table. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows an example funnel chart having seven steps. The width of each rung in the funnel encodes the number of visitors accessing each page. It shows that 183 visitors entered the site and only seven completed the purchase. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Source/Target Chart all paths between two pages.</head><p>Source/target analysis shows a set of successful paths between two designated pages. The user of a source/target analysis designates two pages (e.g. the home page and the products page), and can then view the successful paths for sessions that accessed both pages. One goal for source/target charts is to identify inefficient navigation patterns. For example, if the most common paths between two pages involve a third page, it suggests adding a hyperlink to streamline navigation. A similar type of "couple analysis" computation (without a visual component) is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. We have created a new visual metaphor for this, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Here we size the flow links between successive pages to encode the traffic volumes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Leaky Pipe Chart ad hoc path and flow analysis</head><p>The previous metaphors allow a user to specify single start and end points for analysis. Sometimes however a more general analysis mode is required that allows the user to specify a set of starting points, a set of destination points, and possibly a set of intermediate points. This allows the user to set up a moderately complex network of interest and view traffic flow through that network to discover patterns in the flow. Within this presentation, we have encoded the volume of traffic by the thickness of lines so that customer dropout from source to destination is revealed. This leakypipe analysis is similar to the clickstream tool in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and can be very useful for discovering larger traffic patterns within a website. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows an image of our leaky-pipe analysis tool. We used a modified hierarchical layout algorithm with crossing reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Inter-site Chart show flow among websites</head><p>Sophisticated organizations will frequently run multiple websites that are related. For example, one large financial organization has websites for on-line banking, mortgage originations, home equity loans, etc. In total, this organization operates approximately a couple dozen websites. A critical business problem for it is to understand cross-site traffic flows. For example, how frequently do on-line banking customers access the mortgage site? <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Hierarchical Flow Chart flow among content</head><p>Flow analysis is a special case of path analysis with only a single-step transition between source and destination. For example a marketing person might want to determine how many users clicked on a promotion link to view a specific product. If we generalize this example to include multiple promotions with multiple products, a fairly complex network of single step flows can develop. To support this type of analysis, we have created a multi-dimensional data model that constructs content hierarchichies from website structures. These content hierarchies can be drilled down to show detail, or rolled up to aggregate. In our example, we might break a website down into top-level categories, two of which are Promotions and Products. Each of these can be further broken down into their specific subcategories. Attributes in the data model (such as time or visitor type) can also be used to filter the data. Our system can also show the difference in flows over time. Our system allows the user to view the differences using a sequence of color coded leftright bar charts. In addition to time, we can compute differences on any other attribute such as domain name, or visitor type. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> shows the difference in flows between promotions (left) and products (right) over time. It shows that promotion-product flow increased for all promotions except the topmost one. Our data model includes many other attributes such as time or purchasing behavior, which provide a rich capability for filtering and differencing. In addition, we can use this flow metaphor to directly represent those attributes. For example, a given flow pattern between promotions and products can be further broken down by another attribute such as time of day. Our system lets the user view those attributes as branches within the flow metaphor. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Live Hot Spot Page show click locations</head><p>A critical problem for a website designer is how to arrange the content on the page so that it is easy and efficient to use. Live Hot Spot Pages can show where users are clicking on a page. They superimpose click density information over a "live" web page, while still allowing the user to interact with the page in the same way as they would with a normal browser. Click locations in drop-down menus etc. also have click density information superimposed on them. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>, on top of each clickable location (including in the drop-down menu) a semi-transparent rectangle visually encodes the number of times that each particular link was clicked (using a blue-yellow colormap). This display is particularly useful since it shows which regions of a web page, images, and links are generating user activity. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Path Analysis Portal</head><p>We have combined all of these path analysis metaphors into a single "Path Analysis Portal" that lets the user rapidly switch between the different modes of path analysis. The portal is a browser-based thin client that uses Java applets and a dash of JavaScript. All of our presentation metaphors have a similar "look and feel" and have a number of features in common. Animation is used extensively to show either the initial directions of path flow, or to show the buildup of flow over time. The latter is used in conjunction with semiopaque rendering to "accumulate" traffic volume within the alpha channel. As multiple time-steps lay down traffic flow along a given path, the opacity of the path increases as successive semi-transparent lines are overlayed. Thus flow traffic can be visually encoded as a line thickness and/or as an opacity, depending on whether we are viewing time varying flows or a single snapshot.</p><p>This portal serves as a front end for our tiered architecture for path analysis. At the back end we have stored clickstream data in a number of data formats including relational webhouses and hierarchical multidimensional OLAP datawarehouses. In our middle tier, we have created web services that perform the path analysis algorithms, and ship the results via XML to the portal or other client for presentation. Although the client is able to send sophisticated data requests to the middle-tier services, it does so in a metaphorspecific language and without reference to specific details of the back-end data. This architecture greatly facilitates rapid creation of new presentation metaphors as the need arises for them. In most cases, we can automate the construction of our presentation parameters from a simple query to discover our product database schemae.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>This paper describes a set of charting types and a system for website path analysis. Broadly speaking, there are three research contributions. First, we have partitioned a broad problem (path analysis) into a set of six distinct subproblems. For each subproblem we constructed an algorithm for data extraction and created a visual presentation metaphor.</p><p>The second research contribution involves the visual metaphors. Although some of our visual metaphors contain conventional aspects, they also contain many novel features. The funnel charts can be attached to HTML tables (overlaid on top of any column); the source/target, leaky pipe, and intersite traffic charts are animated to show time-varying flows and can also show traffic differences; the flow charts provide a hierarchical structure to the clickstream with visual drill-down and differences; to our knowledge the live hot spot pages and source/target chart with embedded funnels are unique. Even where the chart type itself is not completely novel, it's application toward path analysis is.</p><p>Finally, our third contribution is to combine our presentation metaphors into a common portal for interactive path analysis. This portal, uses web services to provide an interactive environment for visual path analysis from a common web browser. Within this environment each individual metaphor is simple to manipulate and understand, and when taken together they provide a rich set of analysis tools for understanding web-site traffic.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Funnel chart showing dropout rates.</figDesc></figure>
