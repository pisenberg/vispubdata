				<p>Analyzing options is a complex, multi-variate process. Option behavior depends on a variety of market conditions which vary over the time course of the option. The goal of this project is to provide an interactive visual environment which allows the analyst to explore these complex interactions, and to select and construct specific views for communicating information to non-analysts (e.g., marketing managers and customers). In this paper we describe an environment for exploring 2-and 3-dimensional representations of options data, dynamically varying parameters, examining how multi-variate relationships develop over time, and exploring the likelihood of the development of different outcomes over the life of the option. We also demonstrate how this tool has been used by analysts to communicate to nonanalysts how particular options no longer deliver the behavior they were originally intended to provide.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Foreign currency exchange options are financial constructs which are widely used by investors to speculate on the price of foreign currencies and to provide protection (to "hedge") against unfavorable fluctuations in the marketplace. Option behavior is a complex, multi-variate process, where pivotal features and relationships develop over time. Option behavior, thus, provides an excellent model for exploring how visualization can be used to improve the way we understand, make decisions about, and communicate about multivariate phenomena which develop over time. One basic type of foreign currency option <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[CR85]</ref> is a call. A (long) call is the right, but not the obligation, to buy a particular currency (e.g., American Dollars) and sell a second currency ( e.g., Swiss Francs) at an agreed-upon price ratio (strike) at an agreed upon time (expiration date) in the future. (A put is the right, but not the obligation, to sell at a particular price. "Short" versions of puts and calls are the sale ¢ gresh, rogowtz, tignor@us.ibm.com £ ej.mayland@worldnet.att.com of the right to buy or sell). The value function of a put or call is typically visualized (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[WDH93,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Hul93]</ref>) using line graphs to compare the value of the option at expiration with the value at some point in time prior to expiration. (see also <ref type="bibr">[Pic95]</ref>.) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows graphs of the value of a long and short call as a function of the market condition (spot price) at the expiration date. At expiration the value of a call is the payoff (or loss in the case of a short call) if the conditional contract is invoked. For example, if the market rate (spot) is lower than the strike price the long call has zero value, reflecting the fact that it wouldn't be exercised to buy currency at a higher rate than it could be bought in the open market. If spot is higher than strike, the (unit) payoff is simply the difference between the spot and the strike since the contract can be used to buy at the strike price then sell at the spot price in the open market. The higher the spot price, the proportionally greater the option value. For the holder of the short position, these gains are instead losses, since the currency must be purchased at the spot price in order to sell it (at the lower strike price) to the exerciser of the option. This simple, ubiquitous, diagram, however, does not capture the complexity of the underlying situation, and does not provide an adequate metaphor for decision-making. First, this view typically shows the value of the option at a particular time, usually at the expiration date, and does not show how this function changes over the life of the option. At times before the expiration date, the theoretical value of the option can be computed based on the "expected payoff," using the historical volatility of the spot price. From this point on we will refer to this value as TV, for "theoretical value," and will use TV as a reasonable estimate of both where the option would trade in the marketplace and as a fair value for the expected payoff. It is possible, of course, to present a family of curves, each representing TV at a different time step on the way to expiration. These curves, however, can overlap and be very difficult to discriminate. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> is an example.</p><p>Second, decision-making about options also depends on other derived option behaviors, including, e.g., delta (the derivative of TV with respect to spot) and decay (the derivative of TV with respect to time). These derivatives are also most typically depicted as simple line-drawings, plotting individual parameters of the option as functions of spot or time. An analyst may want to examine how two different parameters interact. For example, it might be of interest to examine value and delta as a function of spot for a set of time steps over the life of the option. It is possible to create a series of line drawings for each parameter, but identifying corresponding time steps in the two graphs can be difficult. Furthermore, the analyst may want to know the value of delta at a particular point on the TV curve, or how TV and delta co-vary over time.</p><p>Third, the analyst may want to examine these data with respect to calculated criteria, for example, to estimate which regions of the curves are more or less likely to be visited over the lifetime of the option. Certainly regions closer to the current spot price are more likely than regions very far away, but a quantitative estimate is impossible without explicitly including this calculation in the representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enhancing the Standard Line Drawings</head><p>Some of the drawbacks of the standard view can be alleviated by incorporating interactivity and color into the visualization. For example, the problem of distinguishing which lines represent which time steps can be addressed by using a different color for each time step. Interpreting this type of graph, however, is not immediate or "pre-attentive," especially if there are many curves. Interactive brushing can provide help, where selecting a curve in one graph automatically highlights the corresponding curve in another graph.</p><p>Other variables can be presented simultaneously in line drawings by, for example, coloring the lines according to another variable, or according to probability of occurrence. Some examples are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 3 and 4</ref>. There are limitations to this approach, however. It is difficult to discern the development of behavior over time, it is difficult to represent a second characteristic variable along with probability, and it is impossible to represent two characteristics plus probability over time in simple line drawings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A 3D Construct for Evaluating Option Behavior</head><p>In this section we explore how 3-dimensional representations can be used to enhance problem-solving about options. Options are intrinsically multi-dimensional constructs. Option prices (and other variables associated with options prices) can show strong variation as a function of the underlying market price, as a function of time, and as a function of the interaction of market price and time. Twodimensional projections leave to the user the task of synthesizing the overall behavior from the sets of projections. It may, therefore, be more natural to show the interactions directly in three dimensions. Second, many decision criteria depend on the relationship between price and other derived options behaviors, including, e.g., delta and decay. Representing each of these behaviors in a common graphical context can help with the recognition, understanding, and communication of relationships between the various risk behaviors in a given situation. Third, once the user has reached an understanding of how a given surface represents a particular decision context, the surface can be used as a representational framework, in terms of which further information about the decision context can be organized and understood.</p><p>We have developed a 3-d metaphor which can be used to simultaneously represent a wealth of useful decision-making information, in an easy to absorb format. In this representation, we use two dimensions to represent an option parameter as a function of spot price. We use the third dimension to extrude this 2-d function from the current date to expiration. This gives the analyst a continuous view of the time-varying behavior, not simply three or four sampled time steps. Furthermore, we can use this surface to unambiguously represent the values of another parameter at each spot and at each time, representing, for example, the theoretical value of the option (TV) as height and delta as color. Furthermore, we have provided a set of different types of color maps, depending on the goal of the visualization. For example, a "segmented" color map can be used in order to visually divide the range of values into discrete, meaningful regions, while an "isomorphic" map can be used to represent continuous variables. In our system, we make use of color maps based on perceptual principles ([RT98]).</p><p>We also use this surface to represent calculated functions, such as probability, indicating which regions of the surface correspond to future market behaviors which lie within one-and two-standard deviations of the most likely market behavior. This can help the user visually separate likely from unlikely outcomes in the future evolution of the marketplace. We calculate these probability regions using the same historical volatility of exchange rate as was used to value the option.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An Interactive Visual Exploration Environment</head><p>Being able to examine option parameters in a 3-d context, however, is not sufficient to support the decision-making requirement an analyst faces. The 3-d construct provides a rich analysis metaphor, but it does not allow "what-if" experiments. In order to comprehend the interaction between variables, and how these interactions change over time requires an interactive user interface.</p><p>We have created a visual environment which allows the analyst to interactively select variables, and to explore them using linked 2-and 3-D representations. In our application, the analyst uses the 3-d visualization to provide a global framework for analyzing the option, and uses the linked 2-d projections to enhance that understanding, by providing a reference back to more familiar, traditional visual representations of option behavior. The focal point is the three-dimensional plot depicting an option parameter as a function of spot over time. The analyst interactively selects which option parameter to represent, and can easily cycle through various parameters, e.g., value, delta, or decay, and see how these parameters play out over the time course of the option. The user can also interactively choose whether or not to color the canonical 3-d surface with a color map. A value surface, for example, can be colored by delta, or by the value of the probability function at every point. The user can also select which type of color map to use. The user can also interactively select whether or not to show the probability curves, and can interactively select which sections of the probability space to show. For example, the analyst can look only at the section of the surface which falls within 1 standard deviation of the expected value, or, alternatively, only those sections which are very unlikely to occur.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Examples of Contextual Analysis</head><p>Common uses of options include speculation (taking directional bets on currency price movements), hedging the value of currency payments to be received in the future, and adjusting the risk behavior of other options positions.</p><p>Working with a foreign currency analyst, we have used our interactive system to design visualizations to focus attention on features that are relevant to a particular decision scenario. The goal is not to price the option but to examine a particular contract, under a particular trading objective, relative to the current market conditions, and ask how we can estimate and communicate whether this contract is (still) performing the economic job that it was intended to do.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 1: A "Dead" option</head><p>As our first example we consider a short call <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2</ref>) in a situation where it is "out of the money," that is, where the strike (in, for example, Dollars per Deutsche Mark) is significantly higher than the current spot price. Suppose this option had been sold some time ago either as a straight bet that the Dollar to Deutsche Mark exchange rate would decrease or as a hedge against a future receipt of Deutsche Marks. As <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows, the exchange rate did decrease, and now there is about a month to go until expiration. If this call had been sold as a straight bet on the currency rate, then, while it has been profitable, there is essentially no potential for further profit if the Dollar continues to fall. If, on the other hand, this option had been sold as a hedge against receiving Deutsche marks at some date in the future, then while the loss on the future receipt has been at least partially compensated for by the money we made selling the short call, there is no protection from a further drop in the Dollar. In terms of its likely behavior over the next month, this option is "dead," unable to provide further value. Assuming that we still have the same market view and objectives, and assuming that we still want the hedge or bet, it might be advisable to sell a new call, struck at the current spot price.</p><p>Visually, our diagnosis of "essentially dead" amounts to the fact that this contract has low delta (rate of price changes) over those future market conditions which are likely to occur. To show this, we take the same four curves as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, and spread them out into the third dimension ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5)</ref>. A surface has been drawn connecting the lines, and is colored with a color map representing delta. Low delta regions (less than 0.2) are blue, intermediate values are colored green, and high values are colored yellow. We have used an isoluminant color map to distinguish actual color differences from differences in appearance due to shading of the 3-dimensional surface. The color map is segmented to allow the viewer to visually separate the space into meaningfully distinct regions.</p><p>A vertical red line marks the current spot price, and this red line is continued across the surface, showing the region of the surface that the option will be in if spot price remains at its current value. Clearly if spot doesn't change, this option would remain in the blue (low delta) region. The green and gray parabolas bound regions within one-and two-standard deviations respectively, of the current spot. Clearly, within one standard deviation, most of the surface is blue, indicating a fairly low probability that spot will move out of the low delta region over the lifetime of the option. This is another way of saying that this contract has little remaining potential for participating in changes in the price process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 2: Symmetric Risk</head><p>In this example we consider a call in a situation where it is well "in-the-money," that is, where the current spot price is significantly higher than the strike. Suppose this option had been purchased some months ago (for a fraction of its current value), either as a hedge against a future currency obligation or as a straight bet on this particular exchange rate. This contract has been a winner, but in terms of its likely near-term behavior, this option has acquired symmetric risk and reduced leverage, both undesirable relative to the stated trading objectives. How can visualization help us recognize and understand the problem with this option?</p><p>First of all, what is the problem with symmetric risk? Before the expiration date, for every dollar that spot increases, the value of the option increases by a dollar. But similarly, for every dollar that spot decreases, the value of the option decreases by a dollar. It is as if the holder of the option is holding the currency itself, rather than an option on the currency. This customer has lost downside risk protection. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref> clearly shows this symmetric risk situation. The recommendation would be to sell the option (receiving a high price) and then purchase another call struck at the currently higher spot price.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 3: Leaking value</head><p>As a final example we show an option that has "leaking value." In this case decay, the derivative of value with respect to time, is large and negative: the value of the option is decreasing rapidly with time. This typically occurs as the expiration date of the option nears. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figures 7 and 8</ref> show views of decay (rather than TV) as a function of time and spot price. The value of the option is currently dropping at over 5% per day, and that decay is likely to grow worse as time goes on. A typical recommendation for cases where this behavior is undesirable relative to current trading objectives might be to sell this option and buy a new one with an expiration date farther in the future. Note that this view utilizes a different color map than used previously. Here the map is constructed to specifically highlight regions where decay is greater than 5% per day.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We have described an interactive environment which allows the viewer to examine a variety of variables characterizing option behavior over the time remaining until expiration, while also allowing estimation of the likelihood of different regimes. The same visualization construct can be used to examine portfolios of options, e.g. sets of options designed to achieve particular goals of risk protection at a reasonable price. As an example, consider the multinational firm interested in protecting itself against a large exchange rate fluctuation. The firm can purchase both a call and a put on a particular currency and count on offsetting income should politics, war, or a natural disaster radically change the value of the currency. Furthermore, the firm can choose the strike prices of the call and put to reflect either its belief in the likelihood of such an event or its willingness to pay for the coverage. The portfolio of options illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref> shows a portfolio termed "bottom vertical combination." The strike prices of the call and put are 1.45 and 1.5 respectively. The firm will absorb small exchange rate fluctuations but is protected against swings which might otherwise be a serious problem. The flat horizontal region of the 3D representation shows the range of exchange rates over which the firm will absorb price fluctuations. The visualization construct also handles other common combinations such as spreads, butterflies, and barrier options.</p><p>In addition to using this system to design effective ways of visually communicating certain types of options behavior, we have also created a mechanism to automatically create sets of visualizations based on a database of customer option portfolios, and deliver these over the web. This type of system could be used by options marketing representatives whose responsibility it is to monitor customer portfolios and communicate recommendations to their customers. In this system, appropriate viewing parameters are automatically created based on characteristics of the option and the type of behavior to be highlighted, and web pages incorporating text and images are automatically generated and placed on a server.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we have studied the visualization of foreign currency options as a way of gaining insight into the representation of complex, multivariate behaviors. We have developed an interactive environment which allows the analyst to explore many variables and their interactions, and to design visual representations which make it easy to recognize, understand, and communicate those aspects of the situation which are relevant for decision making. One application of these representations would be to help marketing managers more quickly communicate why a particular option is no longer behaving as desired, and to help clients make better informed decisions about what they should do.</p><p>An important goal of this work has been to create understanding at a glance: The ability to see multi-variate dependencies over time, marked by probability boundaries. Use of the third dimension allows the addition of significant additional information to the curves, without obscuring the information contained within the original lines (with which the viewers of this information are familiar). Not only is the shape of the value or decay curve as a function of both spot price and date shown directly, but in addition, two other variables (e.g., decay or delta, and probability) can be shown simultaneously. All of these variables are important in communicating and quantifying the characteristics of the option given current market conditions. In addition, the application can easily be used to educate the viewer not only about options, but also about how to view three dimensions, by animating the standard view into the three dimensional view. This education has been found to be very useful to users initially unfamiliar with three-dimensional representations.</p><p>By using the prototype application we have developed, an analyst can interactively explore the options using a wide range of possible visualizations (which variable is shown, what color map is used, what region is shown, what lines are drawn, etc.) In this paper, we have shown how an analyst could represent a few classic scenarios which a customer might want to restructure. Once this elucidating representation is selected, the prototype can automatically represent these, and similar options, in this manner, and post the resulting visualizations on a server for web access.</p><p>Finally, the flexible application allows easy experimentation to explore the types of visualizations which best serve the goal of educating the end viewer (client).     represents high delta (greater than 0.6).
