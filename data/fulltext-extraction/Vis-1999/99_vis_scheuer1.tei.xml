<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Vector fields play a substantial role in mechanical engineering and physics. In recent years, many different techniques for visualizing two and three-dimensional vector fields have been developed. Traditional approaches in vector field visualization comprise symbolic representations with glyphs, streamlines, and stream surfaces. Although important features of the vector field can be extracted with all these methods, in general they require detailed knowledge about where to place symbols or seed points. Depending on their placement, eddies or other singularities can be missed. Texture based methods do not suffer from these problems and will be introduced next.</p><p>A continuous visualization of a two-dimensional vector field can be presented by a texture. The directional information is depicted by line structures in the direction of the vector field. These lines can be "seen" due to the higher coherency between neighboring pixels in the field direction. Spot noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> and line integral convolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> are based on this principle (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> for a detailed comparison). In computational fluid dynamics (CFD) the flow direction is often visualized by a gray-scale LIC image. The image can be colored by the velocity of the flow. This can be easily achieved by using the HSV color model. The velocity is mapped into hue and the gray-scale LIC image is used as value.</p><p>We have focused our attention to a special case of vector fields:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Ú Å Ê ¿ (1)</formula><p>where Å is an open subset of Ê ¾ . The idea is to split the vector field into tangential and normal components. Then we can compute an LIC texture in tangential space and deform the plane or manifold according to the given vector field. Subsequently, we can use standard texture mapping technique to project the LIC image onto the deformed plane. The resulting three-dimensional scene is lit by parallel light and its diffuse reflection on the deformed plane enables the viewer to experience the three-dimensional deformation. This process is supported either by interactively changing the point of view or by automatically moving the light source around the object on a predefined path. The movement of the shadows on the deformed surface makes it possible to detect the three-dimensionality of the deformation.</p><p>It should be noted that the extension of our strategy is straight forward, if Å is a two-dimensional manifold in Ê ¿ instead, although it might be hard to distinguish between the initial deformation of the surface and the actual deformation itself. One idea is to enable the viewer to interactively change the scaling of the deformation normal to the surface, so it is possible to find the areas of large normal deformations.</p><p>In the following, we will first present, in Section 2, some background information and cite related works. Section 3 describes our idea and strategy in detail. In Section 4 we introduce an application from mechanical engineering to prove the relevance for examining planar vector fields with normal components. Some implementation issues and results are discussed in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper with some final remarks and future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background and Related Work</head><p>To visualize three dimensional vectors on a manifold, placing glyphs (e.g. directed lines, arrows, cones, etc.) at selected points of the vector field, is an idea which immediately springs to mind. The directed line, for example, starts at the point with which the vector is associated and is oriented in the direction of the vector components. The length of this line should be equal to the vector norm, but typically, scaling by a constant is necessary to improve visual results. This method is often referred to as a hedgehog. Rendering techniques for displaying deformation surfaces have been previously investigated and are a standard feature in some visualization systems such as FAST <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>One more sophisticated method was presented by Max, Crawfis and Grant <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. Their idea was to grow little hairs out of the surface and then have them bend in the flow field. Since we have no vector field defined outside of the plane, this method is in our case rather equivalent to the above hedgehog.</p><p>Another method has recently gained very much popularity: Line Integral Convolution (LIC). It is based on van Wijk's spot noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> and was introduced by Cabral and Leedom <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Although it is able to deal with two dimensional vector fields only, it provides maximum insight into the directional structure of the vector field.</p><p>Such an vector field Ú Ê ¾ Ê ¾ can be graphically depicted by its integral curves, also known as streamlines. The tangent vectors of an integral curve coincide with the vector field:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Ù ´Ùµ Ú´ ´Ùµµ<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Using arc length reparametrization and chain rule yields</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">× ´×µ Ù Ù × Ú Ú<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Note, that this reparametrization is only valid if Ú ¼ along ´Ùµ. Now we can compute the streamline at Ü¼ by solving the differential equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>with initial condition ´¼µ Ü¼.</p><p>Let be an arbitrary streamline. Then the line integral convolu- </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Á´Ü¼µ Ä Ä ´×µÌ´ ´×µµ × (4)</formula><p>where Ì is a white noise texture and is some filter kernel with Ê Ä Ä ´×µ × ½ . The resulting image consists of highly correlated pixel intensities along the streamlines, but independent in perpendicular directions. This original LIC method tends to be slow, due to the fact that a new streamline is computed for every pixel of the output image. Premising a constant filter kernel , Stalling and Hege <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> developed a very fast method for computing LIC images, called FastLIC. This method computes many pixel intensities along each individual streamline by updating the pixel intensities with just two small correction terms.</p><p>The above standard LIC algorithm is applicable only to vector fields over regular two dimensional Cartesian grids. Forssell <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> presented an extension to the LIC method to visualize vector fields over curvilinear grid surfaces, i.e. surfaces which can be parametrized globally using 2D-coordinates. Battke, Stalling, and Hege <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> have used an approach in which the surfaces are tessellated with triangles. Therefore they are able to handle the case of general, possibly multiply connected surfaces.</p><p>A related technique for our approach was presented by Okada and Kao <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> in which LIC textures were colored based on the normal-component of the 3D vector field to reveal flow separation from a manifold in fluid flows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Visualizing Planar Vector Fields with Normal Component</head><p>Let us assume, that the three dimensional vector field Ú Ê ¾ Ê ¿ is discretely defined on a planar and rectangular Cartesian grid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">LIC Computation</head><p>First, we project the given vector field into the tangent space. Since the tangent space is here the parameter space (the plane) itself, we get a two dimensional vector field Ú Ê ¾ Ê ¾ which simply consists of the Üand Ý-components of Ú.</p><p>Then we compute an LIC texture of the vector field Ú. The input texture is a white noise image with 256 different gray shades. We implemented the FastLIC algorithm using a fifth-order Runge-Kutta integrator with adaptive step size adjustment (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> for details). As already mentioned by Stalling and Hege <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, the order of pixels, where streamlines are being computed, is relevant for the execution time of the FastLIC algorithm. We verified in our test cases that quasi-random sequences are superior to simple box or scanline sequences, but results may vary depending on the vector field topology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Triangulation of the Plane</head><p>The next step is the triangulation of the defining plane. If the vector field Ú is defined on a regular grid, e.g. quadrilateral cells, this task is quite easy. Otherwise more sophisticated triangulation algorithms must be employed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Deformation of the Planar Triangle Mesh</head><p>We now deform the previously generated triangle mesh according to the vector field Ú. Therefore, we shift every mesh point along the normal vector about the normal component of the associated vector. Typically, this length is scaled by a user defined scaling factor ¼. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> shows how the grid point È is moved to its</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">new position È ¼ È • ´ Ú´È µ ¡ Òµ £ Ò,</formula><p>where Ò is the surface normal at È . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Data Reduction and Smoothing</head><p>Regular grids can be stored in a very compact way: both the grid points and cells are represented implicitly by specifying the dimension, data spacing, and origin. The deformation process destroys both the planarity and the regularity. Therefore we have an increased memory consumption. Since one of our goals was to render the scene with interactive frame rates on non high-end computers, we decided to reduce the number of triangles in the mesh. There are several suitable polygon reduction methods available, which preserve the original topology and form a good approximation to the original geometry. Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, for example, provide a method for computing a multiresolution adaptive parameterization of surfaces, which enables one to choose the resolution at runtime; possibly depending on the hardware capabilities. On the other hand progressive schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> allow incremental transmission and reconstruction of triangle meshes. However, we decided to use Schroeders algorithm "decimation of triangle meshes" <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> in our test implementation, since it is an integral part of VTK <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore it is often necessary to smooth the decimated triangle mesh, to avoid unintentional light reflections in the forthcoming rendering step. Therefore we choose the very simple, but effective, Laplacian smoothing. This smoothing operation is described by the following equation. Let Ü be the position of point È , then</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Ü •½ Ü • Û Ü • ´Ü Ü µ (5)</formula><p>where Ü •½ is the point's new position, Ü is the position of point È , which is connected to È , and is some user-defined weight. Equation <ref type="formula">5</ref>adjusts È by the average vector Û multiplied by . This equation is applied to all mesh points one after the other. Typically, is a small number (e.g. 0.01) and the smoothing process is appropriately repeated (e.g. 50-100 iterations). Its global effect is a reduction of the curvature's high frequencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Texture Mapping and OpenGL Rendering</head><p>In the end we merge the results from the above visualization techniques by mapping the computed LIC texture onto the deformed plane. Therefore, texture coordinates and normals need to be computed. We chose Phong shading, also known as normal-vector interpolation shading, as illumination model. We defined the material properties of the deformed plane in such a way that diffuse reflection occurred mostly. Higher contributions of specular reflections lead to poor results, because the low curvature of the deformed plane results in large highlights on the surface, which tend to be more confusing than informative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Application</head><p>In this section we give an detailed example of a planar vector field with normal components Ú Ê ¾ Ê ¿ , since it is not very obvious that these vector fields do exist in real-world applications.</p><p>The research group for Recyclability in Product Design and Disassembly at the University of Kaiserslautern investigates the deformation of loaded mechanical parts. One of their goals is to replace composite materials by pure ones. This simplifies the disassembly and recycling process and reduces costs; production costs as well as disassembly costs. The deformation is gauged by an electronic speckle pattern interferometer (ESPI) which calculates the deformation distributions in quantity with the help of phase shifting and digital image processing. The object under test is illuminated with laser light and is viewed using a CCD camera (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, for example). The interference pattern caused by the laser and observed by the CCD camera includes the information of the deformation in each point of the imaged object.</p><p>We are now looking into the deformation of an intake manifolds's flange. This intake manifold is designed and produced by Mann &amp; Hummel GmbH, which is a german auto component company. The intake manifold feeds air to the various cylinders of the five cylinder turbo-charged diesel engine, that is built into Daimler-Chrysler's Mercedes-Benz C250 and E290 passenger cars (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref>). The flange is bolted to the engine block. So the deformation due to the axial pressure caused by the bolting is simulated by a compressive load and gauged by the ESPI <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 6 and 8)</ref>.</p><p>The flange consists of glass-fiber reinforced polyamide. The characteristics of this material depend on the glass fiber content, the fiber orientation as well as on its length and its distribution. Furthermore the material properties indicate a strong dependency on time, temperature, and moisture content. Usually, the flange is stiffened by a carrying bracket, but has been removed for the experiments. The recess at the flange lower surface is just as caused by production as the point of molding on the lower left-hand side.</p><p>The ESPI yields the relative displacements between the undeformed and the deformed state. Therefore, we assume the part's surface to be planar, which it is obviously not, but the ESPI does not know, either. The displacements, gauged by the ESPI, are given as a 16-bit gray-scale image for each Ü-, Ý-, and Þ-component, respectively (see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>) on a regular Ü ¾ grid (it is subsampled by a factor of five to speed up the visualization pipeline, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>).</p><p>The absolute displacement is known for the minimum and max-  imum gray-scale only, so other gray-scales need to be interpolated linearly. The individual components are joined for each grid point to a three-dimensional vector and serve then as input data for the following visualization algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>The Hedgehog method supplies a rough overview of the deformation of the flange <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Figure 10</ref>). The areas, within which material is moved forward or backward, can be clearly distinguished. However, the in-plane shift remains practically invisibly, since the deformation is larger in the normal direction than those of the other two tangential directions.</p><p>Critical points of the vector field are likely to be overlooked, because this method relies on a "sufficient" chosen number and placement of the spines. The molding point, for example, is insufficiently emphasized.</p><p>Let us now have a look at the standard LIC method. Therefore we project the vector field into tangent space, that is in this special case the ÜÝ-plane. The LIC image shows the directional informa- tion only <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 9</ref>), but the amount of displacement, i.e. the vector length, can be visualized by a color coding scheme (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, for example). A surprising result of the LIC visualization of the deformed flange is, that the deformation is asymmetric, although the flange and its loading situation let us expect a symmetric deformation. This is caused by the anisotropic behaviour of the glass-fiber reinforced polyamide.</p><p>In the previous section we described a slightly different approach to visualize the normal component of the vector field: We deform the plane according to the vector field and then map the LIC texture onto this deformed plane. We have implemented a program, which enables us to input the ESPI's gray-scale images and to perform the visualization pipeline in Section 3. The program is implemented in C++ using the Visualization Toolkit 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. It runs on SGI-Irix as well as PC-Linux. We had to add only a few filters to VTK (LIC computation, for example), to construct the whole pipeline of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. One of the various results that can be obtained by our program is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 1</ref>. Some results can be experienced interactively using an arbitrary VRML-2.0 viewer (CosmoPlayer 2 , for example). Point your favorite viewer to the URL given in the footnote. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Eye point Another idea is to fix the point of view and move the light source along a predefined path. Let us assume the undefined plane, i.e. the parameter space of the vector field, lying inside the ÜÝ-plane. Then we can choose a radius Ö in the ÜÝ-plane and height above the plane based on the dimensions of the bounding box of the deformed plane ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>). The movement of the light source can now be parameterized by the angle «. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 11</ref> shows eight rendered images with « £ AE ( ¼ ). The three dimensional deformation of the plane can be "'seen"' due to the shadow movement on the surface. The importance of the molding point might even be underestimated by the LIC visualization technique <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 9</ref>), but the deformation peak in the normal component is clearly emphasized here. The information gained from the deformation and the LIC texture gives engineers hints how to change parameters in the molding process to produce even more durable and loadable parts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We have described a simple, but effective method for visualizing planar vector fields with normal components. Further we presented an application from mechanical engineering, to prove the practical relevance of such vector fields. This visualization method is especially useful in structural mechanics, but can be used in other application areas, e.g. fluid dynamics, too.</p><p>We still have several ideas in mind: First, the gauged information at the surface of a mechanical part can be used to verify the results obtained from finite element analysis. In the case of the flange presented in the previous section, FEA is complicated due to the highly anisotropic behavior of the fiber-reinforced polyamide. Moreover, the stress-strain relation (the material property tensor) depends on the position, i.e. the material is not homogeneous. Therefore, the molding process needs to be simulated to gain additional information about the fiber distribution and orientation.</p><p>The second goal is to extract the geometry of the mechanical part from a CAD model. Then we can visualize the exact deformation on the part's surface. As we have already mentioned, the LIC texture can then be computed directly on the triangulated surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Since the ESPI gauges the deformation in a rectangular area only, one challenging problem is to automatically find the corresponding area on the CAD model. If the area under consideration contains any feature edges, this task could probably be accomplished.    <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> which adhere to the RenderManÖ interface standard (RenderMan is a registered trademark of Pixar).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Data-flow diagram of our visualization pipeline tion at Ü¼ ´¼µ is defined by</figDesc></figure>
