				<p>Visualization of topological information of a vector field can provide useful information on the structure of the field. However, in turbulent flows standard critical point visualization will result in a cluttered image which is difficult to interpret. This paper presents a technique for collapsing topologies. The governing idea is to classify the importance of the critical points in the topology. By only displaying the more important critical points, a simplified depiction of the topology can be provided. Flow consistency is maintained when collapsing the topology, resulting in a visualization which is consistent with the original topology.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Helman and Hesselink introduced the concept of vector field topology in flow visualization, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Flow topology combines the simplicity of schematic depictions with the quantitative accuracy of curves computed directly from the data. Topology visualization captures the essential features when applied to simple flow fields. For complex flows, however, the large number of critical points results in an image that is difficult to interpret. For example, consider the topology of a turbulent flow in figure 1. The data originates from a direct numerical simulation of flow around a square cylinder at a high Reynolds number. The image shows the topology of the skin friction on one side of the cylinder. Small colored icons are used to display the critical points: a spiral icon denotes a focus, a blue cross denotes a saddle point, and disks denote nodes. Green is used to denote source points while red is used to denote sink points. The trajectories are tangent lines connecting two critical points. The computed set of 338 critical points is very large. It is difficulty to perceive the global structure of the field due to cluttering of critical points and trajectories in the image. Note that critical points tend to be clustered in small local regions of the flow.</p><p>An approach to overcome the problem of cluttering would be to visualize a selection of the topology of the flow. The governing idea is to classify the importance of the critical points. By only displaying the more important critical points, a simplified depiction of the topology can be given, yet the global nature of the flow field is maintained.</p><p>In a previous paper, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, we proposed a technique for the visualization of global flow structures using multiple levels of topology. A filter mechanism was introduced that prunes less important critical points. The filter is based on a user controlled distance metric between certain pairs of critical points. In this paper, we first generalize the notion of multiple level topology visualization. Second,  a new method is introduced for maintaining topology consistency when deleting critical points. Third, a new filtering criterion is introduced, based on an area metric. The area metric is a more accurate classifier of the importance of critical points. The technique can be used to improve the importance in the selection of the set of critical points. The resulting visualization is simpler, yet consistent with the original topology.</p><p>The format of this paper is: In the next section we briefly review previous work. Section 3 introduces some nomenclature, discusses the notions of inflow and outflow areas and show how a topology can be collapsed without compromising topology consistency. In section 4, we discuss the computational aspects involved in constructing a topology graph and the steps involved in collapsing topologies. Finally, in section 5 we apply the technique to a complex application: the visualization of skin friction on a square cylinder in a turbulent flow field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>The visualization of vector field topology has been introduced by Helman and Hesselink, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The topology presents essential information of a flow field by partitioning the field in regions using critical points connected by tangent lines. Critical points are points in the flow where the velocity magnitude is equal to zero. Each critical point is classified based on the behavior of the flow field in the neighborhood of the point. For this classification the velocity gradient tensor is used. The velocity gradient tensor -or Jacobian -is defined as J = rũ = ux uy vx vy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> in which subscripts denote partial derivatives. The classification is based on the two complex eigenvalues (R1 + i I 1; R2 + i I 2).</p><p>Assuming that the the critical point is hyperbolic, i.e. the real part of the eigenvalues is non zero, five different cases are distinguished (see figure 2) : Saddle point, the imaginary parts are zero and the real parts have opposite signs; i.e R1 R2 0 and I1 ; I 2 = 0.</p><p>Repelling node, imaginary parts are zero and the real parts are both positive; i.e R1 ; R2 0 and I1; I2 = 0. Attracting node, imaginary parts are zero and the real parts are both negative; i.e R1 ; R2 0 and I1; I2 = 0. Repelling focus, imaginary parts are non zero and the real parts are positive; i.e R1 ; R2 0 and I1; I2 6 = 0 . Attracting focus, imaginary parts are non zero and the real parts are negative; i.e R1 ; R 2 0 and I1; I 2 6 = 0 .</p><p>When the real part of the eigenvalues is zero, the type of the flow is determined by higher order terms of the approximation of the flow in the neighborhood of the critical point.  Trajectories traced from saddles in the direction of the eigenvectors of the velocity gradient tensor will partition the flow field in distinct regions.</p><p>In a previous paper, we have proposed a technique for the visualization of multiple levels of flow topology, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Two methods have been introduced: implicit methods filter the data in order to suppress flow patterns at small spatial scales. A low pass filter can be used to suppress high-frequency patterns and thus limit the number of critical points. Explicit methods prune the set of critical points, making use of specific knowledge about characteristics of the flow topology. As an example of an explicit method a pair distance filter was introduced. The motivation of this filter is that an often occurring small disturbance of the flow is caused by pairs of critical points. For example, the topological structure of a two dimensional vortex consists of a repelling or attracting focus combined with a saddle point (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">figure 3)</ref>. The size of the vortex is determined by the distance between the pair of critical points. Removing the pair from the topology will result in a collapsed topology in which the global structure of the flow is still intact. Multi-level topologies are a first step to make flow topology analysis more useful for transient and turbulent flows. It has been successfully applied to a complex turbulent flow. Nevertheless, a number of drawbacks to the pair distance filter should be mentioned. First, the distance filter cannot be used to robustly determine the neighborhood relation near a number of critical points. For example, if there are three critical points all more or less with the same distance to each other, which pair is to be removed? Choosing the pair with the minimum distance is not always the correct choice. Second, distance is not a accurate metric for the influence of the critical point pair on the rest of the flow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Concepts</head><p>In this section we introduce nomenclature of vector fields and flow functions and discuss the concepts of inflow and outflow areas. We illustrate these with a simple example. Refer to Asimov's notes on flow topology, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, or Arnold's book on ordinary differential equations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, for a more rigorous treatment of these concepts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nomenclature</head><p>We consider a flow field in 2 . Define D 2 as a closed set of Euclidean space 2 bounded by a closed curve B.</p><p>The two dimensional vector field on D is given by a function f : D ! 2 . The flow function : D T ! D defines the trajectory of a point p 2 D for a time t 2 T. In this paper, we assume that the topology of the flow field is continuous and is structurally stable; i.e. the topology will not change by an arbitrary small perturbation of .</p><p>Critical points are points p (p 2 D) for which p; t = p. We denote a sink point as p in , a source point as p out , and a saddle point as p .</p><p>The function b : B ! is denoted as the mapping of every point on the boundary to ,; , depending on the angle of the tangent of with respect to the boundary B. A boundary inflow, denoted as B in in which B in B, is defined as the curve segment for which the function b is positive. A boundary outflow, denoted as B out , is defined as the segment for which the function b is negative. The points where b = 0 or b = are called switch points. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> We distinguish two types: A positive boundary switch point, denoted as p w+ in which p w+ 2 B, is a point on the boundary in which points into B in . A negative boundary switch point, denoted as p w, , is a point on the boundary in which points into B out . We denote the index of critical point p as Ip and the index of curve X as IX. An arbitrary vector field will satisfy the following condition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X i Ipi = IB (2)</formula><p>in which pi is a critical point and B is the boundary of the domain of the field; i.e. sum of all critical point indices is equal to the index </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">IB = p w+ , p w, + 2 2 (3)</formula><p>in which p w+ and p w, are resp. the number of positive and negative switch points. Combining these relations taking into account that the index of a source or sink is 1 and the index of a saddle point is ,1 we get the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p in + p out = p + p w+ , p w, + 2 2<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Flow Regions Define the sink region of a sink point p in as the set of points whose trajectories "end up in" p in ; i.e. R p in = fp j lim t!1 p; t = p in g <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> in which p in 2 D and p in is a sink.</p><p>Similarly, a source region is the set of points whose trajectories "originate from" a source point p out ; i.e. R p out = fp j lim t!,1 p; t = p out g <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> in which p out 2 D and p out is a source.</p><p>Define the inflow region as the set of points whose trajectories "enter" via boundary B in ; i.e. R B in = fp j 9 b 2 B in 9t 0 : p; t = bg <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> in which B in B and B in is an inflow boundary.</p><p>Similarly, an outflow region is the set of points whose trajectories "exit" via boundary B out ; i.e. R B out = fp j 9 b 2 B out 9t 0 : p; t = bg (8) in which B out B and B out is an outflow boundary.</p><p>Four interesting properties hold for source and inflow regions:</p><p>1. The intersection of any source or inflow region is empty.</p><p>2. The points which do not belong to a source or inflow region are the points located on trajectories originating at saddle points or positive boundary switch points. These trajectories are boundaries between regions.</p><p>3. The boundary of a source region is a curve consisting of a collection of boundary segments which link saddle points to sinks or outflows.</p><p>4. The boundary of a source region can be constructed by following trajectories which originate at a saddle (the two trajectories in the direction of the eigenvectors for which the eigenvalues are positive) or positive boundary switch point.</p><p>Similar properties also apply to sink and outflow regions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Flow areas</head><p>The flow area of a region R, denoted as A R , is the area of a region. Areas can be sorted as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">0 A R 1 A R 2 :::: A R n (9)</formula><p>with n being the total number of inflow, outflow, sink and source regions.</p><p>The influence of a source/sink on the global structure of the flow field is determined by the corresponding region; the smaller the region, the smaller the influence. The area metric assigns the importance of each source/sink point as proportional to the area of the corresponding region. Less important points correspond to small areas.</p><p>Collapsing To simplify the topology, a collection of critical points is replaced by a single critical point. To maintain topological consistency critical points cannot be removed arbitrarily. The new topology should only be locally different from the original topology. Therefor collapsing is introduced.</p><p>Assume an arbitrary closed region C bounded by B C of domain D (i.e. C D). Such a closed region can be contracted to a single critical point without changing the topology outside C. The index of the contraction point will be equal to the index of B C .</p><p>To prevent the introduction of higher order critical points we will limit ourselves to regions where the index of boundary B C is equal to 1. This condition is satisfied if B C is a single boundary in/outflow with respect to C. The type of the contraction point (a source or sink) is determined by whether B C is a boundary inflow or outflow. A collection of critical points can be collapsed into a single source or sink if it can be enclosed by a boundary which is a single boundary inflow or boundary outflow.</p><p>We describe two examples of topologies which satisfy this condition and thus can be collapsed into a single critical point (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">figure 6)</ref>. The first example (left) is where two sources are connected via a saddle. The three critical points are collapsed into a single source. In this case the closed region is an infinitesimal region around the three points and their connecting trajectories. In structurally stable fields a boundary satisfying the conditions needed for collapsing can always be found.</p><p>The second example (right) is a source region contraction. In this case, the closed region C is a complete source region and its boundary plus an infinitesimal layer around it. Collapsing results in a sink point. All trajectories linked to the sink points on the boundary will be connected to the sink point. The middle image shows the shows the corresponding sink and outflow regions. Sink points are shown as six small incoming arrows. Outflow boundary regions are shown with a thick line and an outgoing arrow.</p><p>The right image shows the shows the source and inflow regions. Source points are shown as six small outgoing arrows. Inflow boundary regions are shown with a thick line and an incoming arrow.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">w + w + w - w -w -w - ======== ======== ======== ======== ======== ======== ========</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Computational Model</head><p>In this section we discuss how to compute a collapsed topology based on an area metric. The algorithm consists of the following steps:</p><p>1. Calculate critical points and trace trajectories starting at saddle points. Construct the topology graph and determine the flow regions.</p><p>2. Compute the area of each region. Because the boundary segments are known, numerical integration along the boundary can be used.</p><p>3. Iteratively collapse regions until all remaining areas are greater than a user provided area threshold value. The source/sink/inflow/outflow region with the smallest flow area is collapsed first, followed by the region with the second smallest flow area, etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Draw the collapsed topology.</head><p>Steps 1 and 3 are detailed in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Compute flow regions</head><p>We limit the discussion to source regions. Computing and collapsing sink regions are very similar. The two step procedure is outlined as:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">construct topology graph</head><p>For every saddle point in the data set D, trace two trajectories in the direction of the eigenvectors for which the eigenvalues are 0; i.e. in the outgoing direction. These trajectories must end in a sink point or intersect the domain boundary at a boundary outflow. For every positive boundary switch point on the boundary of the data set, trace a trajectory in the outgoing direction of the switch point.</p><p>Use the obtained information to construct a list of incoming trajectories for each sink point and boundary outflow.</p><p>At each sink point this list is sorted as follows: Choose the first trajectory in the list. For all other trajectories at the source point compute the angle of the tangent vector of the trajectory with the tangent vector of the first trajectory; i.e. anglev0; v i = i where vi is the tangent vector of trajectory si at the source point. Sort the list of trajectories in counterclockwise order according to value of i (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">figure 8)</ref>. At each boundary outflow, the list of trajectories is sorted as follows: sort the intersections of the trajectories with the boundary counterclockwise along the boundary (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">figure 8)</ref>. Similarly, for each source point and boundary inflow, construct a sorted list of outgoing trajectories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">compute region boundaries</head><p>From each source point, choose an arbitrary trajectory from its sorted list. The end point of this trajectory (a saddle or a boundary) is labeled the starting point of the source region boundary. Assuming the starting point is a saddle, compute the two angles of the tangent vector of the incoming trajectory with the tangent vectors of both trajectories in the outgoing direction. Follow the trajectory with the smallest angle to a sink point or boundary outflow.</p><p>Continue by choosing the next trajectory in the sorted list of trajectories associated to the sink point or boundary outflow. At a saddle point, continue by choosing the other trajectory associated with the same eigenvalue. Continue this procedure until the boundary ends in the starting point.</p><p>The idea of constructing a source region boundary is illustrated in <ref type="figure">figure 9</ref>. The left image shows a sample topology containing 7 saddle, 4 source, and 4 sink points. Stippled lines denote sink/inflow regions and solid lines denote source/outflow regions. The middle image shows a zoomed in view of a source region consisting of a source point, 3 saddle and 3 sink points. Small diamonds are used to denote saddle points that are linked to the boundary. Trajectories originating from the source (shown in stippled lines) are labeled as s0; s1; s2. Trajectories ending in a sink point are labeled as s3; s4; s5; s6. Constructing the topology graph will result in a data structure shown on the right. For each point, the trajectories are sorted in counterclockwise order with respect to the angle of their tangent vector in the neighborhood of the point. To compute the region boundary, choose an arbitrary trajectory (s0) and follow it to the starting saddle point. Choose the outgoing trajectory with the smallest angle, i.e. s4, and follow this trajectory to a sink point. Choose the next trajectory in the counterclockwise sorted list, i.e. s6. Continue this procedure until the starting saddle point is reached.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Collapsing Regions</head><p>We now discuss some implementation details of collapsing a source region into a single sink contraction point. The sink point on the <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>: A sample topology (left) containing 7 saddle, 4 source and 4 sink points. Stippled lines denote sink/inflow regions, solid lines denote source/outflow regions. A detailed view is given of one source region (middle) with the corresponding part of the flow topology graph (right). The topology graph is used to construct the region boundary of the source region.</p><p>boundary of the source region with the largest flow area is used as the contraction point. To prevent deformation of the domain boundary, a special case is used for region boundaries that contain a boundary outflow: in this case the boundary outflow is used as the contraction point. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> The idea of collapsing a source region is illustrated in figure 10. In this image part of the topology presented in figure 9 is collapsed. The left image shows the collapsed topology (stippled lines denote sink/inflow regions and solid lines denote source/outflow regions). The middle image shows the collapsed source region. Incoming trajectories to sink points on the boundary of the source region are joined to the contraction point by appending the already existing trajectory segments of the boundary. The right image shows the collapsed topology graph. Hence, if the topology of the original data set is consistent, then the subsequent collapsed topologies will be consistent.</p><p>The motivation of reusing existing trajectory segments to reconstruct the topology graph is based on our desire that the visualization of the collapsed topology closely resembles the original data. Note however that part of the trajectories are reversed in direction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Computational Errors</head><p>The collapsing topology technique described in the previous section works well in theory. In practice, however, there are various sources of computational errors which may lead to inaccurate results. We list a number of these errors:</p><p>The step in which computational errors have the greatest consequences to the correctness of the technique is the trajectory integration. Computing trajectories is error prone due to the instability of the integration process near critical points, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Instabilities even occurred using an adaptive fourth order Runge-Kutta method where the timestep was based on the length of the computed segment. Stable adaptive integration has been addressed by also reducing the time step when the angle of the computed segment with respect to the previous segment is too large.</p><p>A criterion to stop integration when approaching a critical point is difficult to formulate. For example, in the case when two critical points are close together, the distance between the end of the trajectory and a critical point must be sufficiently small to be certain that the line is linked to the correct critical point. However, when a trajectory approaches a rotation center, using a small distance as a criterion will result in extremely long trajectories. In our implementation, we address this problem by extending the distance criterion with information on the trajectory and the type of critical point. For example, the stop distance is set to a larger value when approaching a rotation center.</p><p>Computing the area of a flow region may be prone to numerical error, due to the very large number of small segments that define a boundary. The impact this has on the technique is not very significant, only areas close to the threshold may be unjustly collapsed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Skin Friction on a Square Cylinder</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, methods are discussed for direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent flow. In this particular problem, a DNS of a turbulent flow around a square cylinder at Re = 22,000 (at zero angle of attack) has been performed. The resolution of the rectilinear grid is 314x538x64; the grid was finest nearby the cylinder. The number of time steps saved on disk is 7500. The skin friction on all sides of the cylinder has been computed, resulting in four 2D data sets with a resolution of 104x64. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref> shows three collapsed topologies of the original topology of the skin friction in figure 1. The number of critical points in the original data set is 338. An increasing area threshold has been used to generate the images. From left to right topologies with respectively 139, 59 and 10 critical points are shown. The boundary switch points are shown as blue discs and the boundary of the set is colored to reflect boundary inflows (green) and boundary outflows (red).</p><p>The skin friction field on the square cylinder is characterized by two vertical separation lines, located left and right in the field. The topological representation of the left separation line consists of a number of source and saddle points. The topological representation of the right separation line consists of a number of sink and saddle points. Trajectories originating from the saddle points link both separation lines.</p><p>The global structure of the flow is preserved using the area metric technique. The right image shows the most simplified view of the topology, yet the two main separation lines are preserved. The left image includes many important details caused by the turbulence of The computation time for determination of the topology graph, including trajectory integration, takes 7 seconds on a 250 Mhz MIPS R10K processor. Most time is spent on checks to decide if a trajectory is connected to a source or a sink (see second item in section 4.3). Determination of a collapsed topology from the initial topology for a certain threshold can be done in real-time. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref> shows a detail of the field described above. The detail is taken from the top right of the original field. It is treated as an independent field with its own boundary inflows and outflows. On the left all 85 critical points found in the data are shown. The middle image shows the field using 14 critical points. Here, the individual flow areas for the critical points are clearly visible. Also the separation line is easy to follow. The image on the right shows the result of a very high threshold value. Here the field is reduced to a single source surrounded by a boundary outflow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, a technique for the generation and visualization of collapsed topologies was presented. In this way essential topological features of a flow field can be visualized without an excessively cluttered image. The governing idea of the technique is to classify the importance of critical points. Critical point importance is related to its flow area which is determined by the topology graph. Consistency of the topology graph is maintained when collapsing the topology. The collapsed topology closely resembles the original data.</p><p>After computing the topology graph, collapsing can be achieved in near real-time. This can be used to interactively vary the threshold area. For example, when zooming in on a part of the topology. The technique has been applied to a complex turbulent flow data set from a direct numerical simulation. The application clearly benefits from the collapsed topology technique, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The data set contains an abundance of detailed information. Using traditional topology visualization methods on these data sets, excessive cluttering cannot be avoided. Using the collapsed topology based on the area metrics technique, simplified views of the topology can be obtained without cluttering.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>CWI, Department of Software Engineering, P.O.

The source point and all critical points on the boundary of the region are replaced by one sink point and a collection of trajectories from the sink points on the boundary. On the left is the domain after collapsing the source region. The resulting topology graph is shown on the right. The region collapsing procedure maintains flow consistency, as defined by the relation P i Ipi = IB; i.e. 1 source point, N saddle points and N sink points are replaced by 1 sink point.</figDesc></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">This definition does not take into account the case that b = 0 along a segment of boundary B. It can be shown that in this discussion these segments can be treated as extended switch points.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">We do not collapse the (more complicated) cases in which the boundary of the source region contains more than one boundary outflow because this would introduce deformation of the boundary.</note>
