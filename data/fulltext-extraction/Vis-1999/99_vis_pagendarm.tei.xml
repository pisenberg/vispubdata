				<p>The detection of vortical phenomena in vector data is one of the key issues in many technical applications, in particular in flow visualization. Many existing approaches rely on purely local evaluation of the vector data. In order to overcome the limits of a local approach we choose to combine a local method with a correlation of a pre-defined generic vortex with the data in a medium-scale region. Two different concepts of a generic vortices were tested on various sets of flow velocity vector data. The approach is not limited to the two generic patterns suggested here. The method was found to successfully detect vortices in cases were other methods fail.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Vortex Characteristics</head><p>The notion of a vortex is defined by some fluid dynamicists with roughly the same level of precision as a layman tends to talk about a spiral staircase by spiralling his finger towards the sky. There are, however, quite usable definitions for selected types of vortices and their properties which then, hopefully, lead to a mathematical formulation. In order to detect and visualize vortices from within a set of vector data some mathematically defined property is most desirable. Consequently, many of the existing methods suggested to visualize vortices concentrate on one or a limited number of physical properties which are easily defined mathematically and hopefully are detectable when a vortex is in place. One of the simplest approaches is probably the search for local pressure minima which then may be visualized using isosurfaces. Obviously, pressure drop may be caused by flow features other than vortices as well. So the results of this method needs to be interpreted with great caution. Nevertheless, the method is a useful one when applied with its limitation in mind. There exists a wide selection of methods which maybe used for detecting and visualizing vortices. Most of them work with a scheme which uses local properties of the flow field only, that is scalar or vector data at a given grid node or from the grid cell adjacent to the node for the calculation of derivatives at the most (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>).</p><p>One of the widely used algorithms is the λ 2 -method presented by Jeong and Hussein <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Their method is a local method which means that it is fast to evaluate. In their paper they argue against certain methods which attempt to detect closed spiralling streamlines. One argument which they state against this approach is the observation that many streamlines won't complete a full cycle. On a first glance it seems to be very obvious for the human visual system to detect a vortex when it is visualized in some experimental flow. This obviously comes from the fact that the visual system does not evaluate the flow pattern locally, but rather identifies a pattern of color or smoke streaks distributed over a certain region. When the typical spiralling pattern of a vortex becomes visible nobody hesitates in attributing the term vortex to that particular flow feature. This happens because much of the work necessary to make the pattern has been done already beforehand by an experienced experimenter who knows where to introduce the smoke in order to visualize a vortex. In practice this is the tricky part. In particular within unsteady flows, vortices are hard to visualize experimentally. Obviously, it would be an advantage to use a method which is not purely local but does not necessarily require the vortical motion to be consistent across a region large enough to complete a full cycle. This is what we would like to call a medium scale correlation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Concept of the Vortex Detection Method</head><p>The approach suggested here was inspired by the work of de Leeuw and van Wijk <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> on a flow probe. They suggest an icon which bends according to the local curvature of a streamline. Such analysis of a bent piece of a streamline should reveal information about the centre of rotation. While the location of the center of rotation may be done as a local technique, many of those resulting centerpoints which happen to fall into a small region would suggest that the surrounding vector field is highly correlated. By introducing a correlation integral which accumulates the effect of many clustered center points a Curvature Center Density function may be defined. This function should be useful to detect the centre region of vortices which are often referred to as vortex cores. The idea was first picked up for 2-d vector fields by Sadarjoen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The method was successfully applied even to highly irregular flow fields such as coastal flows. In order to cope with the special demand for the analysis of costal flows with its elongated or distorted vortices Sadarjoen and Post <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> have enhanced the method with an additional clustering step. In this paper we will apply the same idea to 3-d vector fields. The problem is more complex because the local properties of a vector field don't immediately reveal information about a large scale vortical pattern. In order to find some way to deduce information about the shape of a vortex from a point-wise local analysis of the vector field, some restricting assumptions about the vortex are needed. For a proof of concept we have implemented to alternative procedures. In one case we assume that a significant portion of the vortex we are after, behaves like a rotating rigid body. The rotation vector or curl is constant and pointing parallel to the axis of the vortex everywhere. However, an arbitrary axial component of the velocity vector may be superposed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Detecting Vortical Phenomena in Vector Data by Medium-Scale Correlation</head><p>In the second case we have assumed that the circumferential velocity of the vortex behaves like a so-called potential vortex. The circumferential speed decreases inversely proportional to the radius. An arbitrary axial velocity component is acceptable for each layer of constant radius. While the potential vortex produces a rotation or curl of zero length, the axial component results in a shear which produces a rotation perpendicular to the vortex axis. These generic vortex models appear to cover a range of vortices occurring in practical cases. For each model the resulting Curvature Center Density will be different. In practice this means that the methods proposed here will not extract a vortex in general but will rather produce a correlation with the selected generic model. This, however, is not a disadvantage. It allows to tune the method to optimize the detection of specific types of vortices. Obviously, one can think of more generic vortices than the two suggested above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Extracting the Local Information</head><p>The mathematics for extracting the necessary local information from the vector field follows the concepts described for the flow probe earlier (see de Leeuw <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for a detailed explanation). In order to obtain the local curvature of a streamline or trajectory line of the velocity vector field u in steady case.</p><p>we need the velocity gradient tensor or Jacobian matrix</p><p>Then the curvature vector normal to that streamline may be found as:</p><p>Now one can construct a local coordinate frame (index l) from the normalized velocity vector which points in streamwise direction everywhere, the curvature vector which points towards the center of rotation and the bi-normal of the first two vectors:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">u u v w) T , , = J u ∇ u x u y u z v x v y v z w x w y w z = = c Ju u u • ( ) u u Ju • ( ) - u 4 ------------------------------------------------------- = M u u ------ c c ----- u c × u c × --------------- , ,     =</formula><p>In a two-dimensional case the curvature c could be immediately used to calculate the position of the center of curvature or the center point of an osculating circle. The distance to the center point would be equal to the radius of the circle or inverse of the curvature. However, in a three-dimensional vortex field the trajectory lines or streamlines are practically always spiralling. As a result of this spiralling motion the curvature is significantly less because the lines are elongated. While the curvature vector by its definition still points towards the center point the distance from this point is much less. In fact, very near to the center the streamlines will be almost straight. The small curvature would result in huge radius where a small radius would be correct. In order to correct for this spiralling effect we need to make assumptions about the velocity distribution in the vortex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Defining a Generic Vortex</head><p>We will now define a generic vortex, which is the model or feature we want to locate within the discrete data later. This vortex will be defined in his own coordinate system which we will denote with index g:</p><p>The three velocity components will later be specified by some parametric function of the distance from the vortex axis . In case the generic vortex is assumed to be derived from the potential vortex these velocity components will be given by: G and T being the parameters which define the actual shape of the vortex. These will later be evaluated when the generic vortex is fitted to the discrete data. In the alternative case the generic vortex is derived from a rigid body rotation as explained earlier a different set of parametric functions is used:. Again g and t are parameters which will later be determined. Obviously, these are intuitive choices which simplify the concept of a vortex to an extreme degree. One can easily think of more elaborate concepts. Until now, we have implemented these two approaches and used them successfully. Work on more complex concepts is on-going and probably will improve the results even further. In order to fit the generic vortex to the discrete data at a given point in space we need to derive equations for the parameters (G,E or g,e in the cases above) as well as for the position of the vortex, that is the coordinate transform between the x g ,y g ,z g coordinate system and the x l ,y l ,z l coordinate system which is aligned locally with the velocity vector. In order to do this we create a coordinate transform analogously to the procedure described in section 3. This can be</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">u g u g v g w g , , ( ) T = r x g 2 y g 2 + = u g Gy r 2 ------- Gx r 2 ------- - E r 2 ----- , ,     T = u g gry grx - e ,<label>, ( ) T =</label></formula><p>performed algebraically. The components of the curl or rotation vector are used to fit the generic vortex to the data. The vector components of the curl of the generic vortex transformed to the local coordinate should be equal to the components of the curl calculated from the discrete data. From this we obtain three equations which allow to express the unknown position of the generic vortex x g ,y g ,z g as well as the parameters G and E (g,e respectively) with the known components of the vector . To close the set of equations we require, of course, that the velocity of the generic vortex is equal to the velocity in the discrete data and the streamline curvature is equal as well.</p><p>The resulting equations are easily obtained. They depend on the generic vortex chosen. We will skip the mathematics here, because it would consume a lot of space in the paper while the result turns out to be rather trivial for the two examples chosen here. This is because the generic vortices don't depend on the coordinate z g , the local coordinate system always points towards the vortex axis and the curl is either purely representing the shear or is independent of the radius depending on which concept was chosen. We obtain simple relations for locating the center of curvature. In a sense, the two selected options represent two extremes of the possible choices. For the first case, that is if the circumfrential velocity decreases with 1/r as in a potential vortex the distance of the curvature center is given by:</p><p>This is equivalent to requiring that the axis of the vortex is perpendicular to a plane spun by the curvature vector and the curl vector. For the second case, in which the circumfrential velocity is proportional to the distance from the center, the distance to the curvature center is given by:</p><p>This is equivalent to require that the axis of the vortex is within a plane spun by the curvature vector and the curl vector.</p><p>Any more complex generic model would lead to a value between these two extremes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluation of the Center of Curvature Distribution</head><p>Once we went through the mathematics described above one may easily run through the discrete data and for any point where the curvature is significantly different from zero obtain a position for the center of curvature by simply multiplying one of the alternative distant measures r with the normalized curvature vector. This will give clouds of points which are dense near the centers of vortices. A weight function f(x) for a center point i is defined as:</p><p>Here <ref type="figure">x=(x,y,z)</ref> is the position where the weight is evaluated, x i is the position of a center of curvature p i in space, V i is the volume of the computational cell from which the point p i is derived because points from larger cells represent more flow volume in irregular grids and r max is the outer limit of the medium scale correlation to be calculated. r max should be chosen according to the radius of the vortical structures which are to be detected in the data. The distribution of the centers of curvature may be represented by a scalar given by</p><p>The curvature center distribution CCD may be evaluated anywhere in space, in particular at the nodes of the computational grid. This allows to visualized the scalar as an indicator for vortex cores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Implementation</head><p>The calculation of curvature center points for the two simple test vortex types was implemented within our in-house visualization system called HighEnd. This allows to visualize the point clouds along with isosurfaces of the resulting curvature center density function and streamribbons in order to verify the results. Whenever operators such as gradient or curl are needed, the system relies on Gaussian integral formulations. This allowed for an easy implementation both for structured and unstructured grids. Aside of testing the algorithm against algebraic test data which naturally provides exact fits, the method was successfully applied to a range of CFD results. We will show only two case studies here. Work on further generic test vortices allowing more free parameters is on-going.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Lambda Vortex in Transitional Flow</head><p>A vector field extracted from a timestep of a 3d-transitional flow exhibits a weak lambda-shaped vortex. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> shows the cores of the vortex nicely visualized as iso-surfaces of the curvature center density. Streamribbons selected to pass through those regions verify the roll-shaped vortex due to their S-shaped behaviour. The distortion of the streamlines is indeed confined to the vincinity of the isosurface. The image, which is also available from different view points provides a strong proof of the concept. In this case the</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ω g ω l r u ω • ω u ----------------c = r t 3 t Jt × ------------ = with t u u ω • ω ------------- ω ω ------- -     = f i x ( ) V i ; if x i x - ( ) r max ≤ ( ) 0; if x i x - ( ) r max &gt; ( ) = CCD f i x ( ) i ∫ =</formula><p>generic vortex used for the test was of the type with increasing circumferential velocity when the radius increases. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> Isosurfaces of the curvature center density precisely denote the shape of the lambda vortex in a simulation of a transitional flow.</p><p>Due to the space constraints of the paper we show only a single image here. We supply images with different viewpoints in the color section revealing even more details. The curvature center density makes it really easy to select starting points for meaningful streamribbons, such as the blue ribbon in the center which splits into two diverging traces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Vortices separating from an Ellipsoid</head><p>The flow field around an ellipsoid exhibits conical vortices with strong axial flow <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>. Once the curvature density function is visualized, the coincidence of the vortical motion with the CCD signal is easily verified using streamlines . <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> Isosurface of the curvature center density visualizing cores of separating vortices.</p><p>This data also reveals a problem of the traditional way of representing vortices by streamribbons. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> combines the iso-surface with a stream ribbon. The highly curled portion of the ribbon ahead of the iso-surface appears to suggest strong vortical motion there.However, the coloring of the ribbon which visualizes the magnitude of the velocity vector proves, that the total motion rapidly decays at that position. Obviously the vector field has a vortical shape there leading to highly curled streamlines. However, there is hardly any motion and streamline integration is trapped in a "deadzone". Only where axial velocity picks up the vortex gains strength. This is correctly visualized by the curvature center density <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> A close-up of the same isosurface combined with a curly streamribbon.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Conclusion</head><p>The extension of the existing curvature center density concept to 3d-space becomes possible after introducing a concept of various simple vortex types. So far, two vortex types were implemented and tested on various CFD-data with good results. Only results from two data sets are shown here.
