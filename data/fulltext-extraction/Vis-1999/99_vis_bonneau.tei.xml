				<p>Multiresolution analysis based on FWT (Fast Wavelet Transform) is now widely used in Scientific Visualization. Spherical biorthogonal wavelets for spherical triangular grids where introduced in [5]. In order to improve on the orthogonality of the wavelets, the concept of nearly orthogonality, and two new piecewise-constant (Haar) bases were introduced in [4]. In our paper, we extend the results of [4]. First we give two one-parameter families of triangular Haar wavelet bases that are nearly orthogonal in the sense of [4]. Then we introduce a measure of orthogonality. This measure vanishes for orthogonal bases. Eventually, we show that we can find an optimal parameter of our wavelet families, for which the measure of orthogonality is minimized. Several numerical and visual examples for a spherical topographic data set illustrates our results.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Representing large data sets by decomposition in a wavelet basis has many applications in scientific visualization. This includes LOD (level of detail) visualization, local area zooming, progressive transmission over networks, compression, and others ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>). Since wavelets were originally discovered in signal analysis, where the data comes from regular samples, their application in scientific visualization began with uniformly gridded data sets. An important application domain for uniformly gridded data visualization is volume visualization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>).</p><p>In the last few years, a major challenge has been to extend wavelet decompositions to work on more general data sets. The introduction of triangular wavelets in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> for geometric meshes, and triangular spherical wavelets in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for scalar spherical data sets, were two crucial steps in that challenge. More recently, generalized Haar wavelets for irregular triangulations have been introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Triangular wavelets are defined over nested triangular grids. These grids are the result of a subdivision process starting on a base triangular mesh, and dividing recursively each triangle into four subtriangles by inserting new vertices at the midpoint of each edge. In LMC-CNRS, BP.53, F-38041 Grenoble Cedex 9, France. the case of spherical data, each edge is part of a great circle, the midpoint is the geodesic bisector, and the base mesh may be either a spherical tetrahedron, octahedron or icosahedron, see This paper deals with piecewise constant triangular wavelets. While this may be seen as a restriction for smooth data sets, it is sufficient for large and non-smooth data. In particular, many earth data sets, which are of special interest in scientific visualization, are usually non-smooth, and thus can be tackled efficiently with piecewise constant wavelets. This has been verified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> where Haar bases are shown to work as good as smoother bases for the compression of the topographic data set that we will use in our illustrations.</p><p>Wavelet bases may be orthogonal, semi-orthogonal or simply biorthogonal. As we shall see later in more detail, over these three types, orthogonal wavelet is the only one which gives direct access to best approximation by discarding wavelet coefficients. Unfortunately, there is no orthogonal triangular Haar bases on the sphere. To overcome this lack, the concept of nearly orthogonality was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. A spherical wavelet basis is said to be nearly orthogonal if it becomes orthogonal when the subdivision depth increases (i.e. when the spherical triangles become planar). Two wavelet bases that are nearly orthogonal were given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we extend the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> in the following directions. First, we give two one-parameter families of spherical Haar wavelet bases that are nearly orthogonal and simpler than in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Then we introduce a measure of orthogonality. This measure vanishes for orthogonal bases, and converges to zero for nearly orthogonal bases, as the subdivision depth increases. Eventually, we show that there exist an optimal parameter value for our new wavelet families, for which the measure of orthogonality is minimal. This paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we give the basics on piecewise constant triangular Haar wavelets. Section 3 is a review of the concept of orthogonality, semi-orthogonality, and nearly orthogonality in the context of triangular Haar wavelets. In section 4, the two new nearly orthogonal one-parameter families of wavelets are introduced. Section 5 is dedicated to the measure of orthogonality and to the optimization of this measure over the new families of wavelets. Eventually, section 6 illustrates our results on an earth topography data set.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nearly orthogonality</head><p>The concept of nearly orthogonality for spherical wavelets was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. As the subdivision depth increases, the spherical triangles become planar, and the areas of the four sub-triangles become uniform.

A wavelet basis is defined as nearly orthogonal, if it is orthogonal in the limit case, i.e. when the four sub-triangle areas are equal.</p></div>

Both of these matrices were proved to be semi-orthogonal and also nearly orthogonal in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>New families of nearly orthogonal Haar bases</head><p>A quick look at previously introduced reconstruction matrices (3), Since we wanted to find both simple (i.e. with low degree polynomial coefficients), and nearly orthogonal matrices, we have started with a 43 sub-matrix containing arbitrary polynomials of degree 1 (linear functions) in 0; 1; 2; 3. Without any condition on the coefficients of these polynomials, the number of free parameters would be 434 = 48.</p><p>A first condition that has to be fulfilled is symmetry. This property states that, when permuting the indices (1,2,3) in the right and left-hand side of the local decomposition/reconstruction relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, the equality should be preserved. Imposing symmetry reduces the number of free parameters from 48 to 10.</p><p>The second condition is semi-orthogonality. This condition reduces further the number of free parameters to three, and we get the following unnormalized, semi-orthogonal families of reconstruction matrices: It should be kept in mind that (7) and (8) must be normalized, and this implies that there is really only one free parameter in (7) and (8). In fact, we can assume without restriction that a = 1 in the rest of this paper (more precisely, if a 6 = 1 , then replacing a by one, and b by b a gives the same matrix after normalization).</p><p>Thus (7) and (8) define two one parameter families of wavelet bases that are symmetric, semi-orthogonal, and orthogonal if 0 = 1 = 2 = 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Orthogonality measure and optimal Haar bases</head><p>In section 4, three previous wavelet bases were recalled, and two new families of wavelet bases were introduced. We now introduce a measure to distinguish all these wavelet bases and we show that, for the wavelet families (7) and (8), optimal values with respect to this measure can be calculated.</p><p>Since our main concern is on the orthogonality of the bases, the following measure was chosen:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">MK = 1 n K X k=1 X T k Z k 1 k 2 + Z k 1 k 3 + Z k 2 k 3 (9)</formula><p>Here K is the finest subdivision level, n is the number of triangles at that level (n equals to the number of base faces times 4 K ), k traverses all levels, and T k traverses all triangles at the level k.</p><p>A straightforward property of the orthogonality measure (9) is that it vanishes if and only if all inner products also vanish, i.e. if the wavelet basis is orthogonal.</p><p>Another property of this measure is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 3</ref>. This figure shows the behaviour of the orthogonality measure (9) for the semiorthogonal basis (3) introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and for the new nearly orthogonal wavelets (7) with parameters a = 1 and b = 0 . The measure (9) has been computed at increasing subdivision depths K, and for three base spherical triangulations (tetrahedron, octahedron, icosahedron). The behaviour of the measure (9) is the same for the three nested triangulations: for the semi-orthogonal basis (3) it increases up to a limit, and for the nearly orthogonal basis (7) with a = 1 and b = 0 it decreases and converges to zero. This is due to the fact that the inner products in (9) converge to a non-zero value for the semiorthogonal basis (3) and to zero for all nearly orthogonal bases.</p><p>Thus we see that the orthogonality measure (9) allows to distinguish the semi-orthogonal and the nearly orthogonal bases.</p><p>It can also be observed that the measure decreases more quickly for the nested grid based on an icosahedron. This is because the triangles become more quickly uniform for this grid.  In the rest of this section, we use the orthogonality measure (9) to find an optimal basis between the two new families of bases (7) and (8).</p><p>In order to do this, we have fixed a certain subdivision depth K,  the free parameters in the bases (7) and (8). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 4a</ref> shows a plot of the results for the family (7), with parameters a = 1 and b increasing from -50 to 50, for the three different nested triangulations, and at the subdivision depth 3. This plot suggests that there exist optimal parameter values for which the orthogonality measure (9) is minimal. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 4b</ref> shows a zoom for the parameter values a = 1 , b</p><p>increasing from -2 to -1. On this plot, the optimal parameter values for the family (7) are now clearly visible. The same behaviour is shown on figures 4c and 4d for the wavelet family (8). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 4</ref> shows also that the family (8) enables to reach a significantly smaller orthogonality measure. In table 1, the computed optimal values at the depth 5, up to a precision 10 ,3 , together with the corresponding orthogonality measure (9) are given.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Results</head><p>The new nearly orthogonal bases (7) and (8) with optimal values given in table 1 have been tested and compared against the previous semi-orthogonal basis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. The tests were performed on three nested spherical triangulations (base mesh tetrahedron, octhedron and icosahedron), subdivided to the level 7. The original topographic data set, available from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration 1 is a 43202160 uniform grid of short values. This data set was mapped on the finest triangulation in order to find the input data values of the wavelet decomposition algorithm. The mapping was done by a simple trapezoid quadrature formula that computes the integral of the original data on the finest triangles. The data set was then decomposed and reconstructed with an increasing number of wavelet coefficients. For each test, the difference between the true L 2 error and the square rooted sum of the squared wavelet coefficients was computed. This measures the orthogonality of the wavelet basis with respect to the input data set in the following sense: it vanishes for orthogonal bases, and increases when the inner products of the wavelets modify the true L 2 error.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>: These tables give the relative difference between the true L 2 error and the square rooted sum of the squared wavelet coefficients used for the reconstruction of the topographic data set. This difference vanishes for orthogonal bases, and should be smaller as possible. The tables show, in particular for the spherical icosahedron base mesh, that the difference is infinitesimal for our optimal wavelet bases (7) and (8).</p><p>wavelet bases (7) and (8) with the optimal parameters given in table 1 greatly reduces the L 2 error due to the non-orthogonality of the basis functions.</p><p>The color plate shows some partial reconstructions obtained with the wavelet basis (8) and optimal parameter values, for the spherical icosahedron nested triangulation. The base mesh can be seen in red on each figure. The parameter a is fixed to 1, and the parameter b is chosen on the X-axis. These plots show the existence of optimal parameter values for which the orthogonality measure is minimal.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .Figure 1 :</head><label>11</label><figDesc>2 subdivision steps starting on a spherical tetrahedron 2 subdivision steps starting on a spherical octahedron 2 subdivision steps starting on a spherical icosahedron Subdivision of spherical triangular meshes</figDesc></figure>
