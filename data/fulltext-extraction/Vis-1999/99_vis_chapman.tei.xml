				<p>The detailed underwater bathymetric data provided by Sonar Research and Development&apos;s high speed multi-frequency sonar transducer system provides new challenges in the development of interactive seabed visualization tools. This paper introduces a &apos;Whole Field Modelling&apos; system developed at Sonar Research and Development Ltd and The Department of Computer Science, University of Hull. This system provides the viewer with a new 3D underwater visualization environment that allows the user to pilot a virtual underwater vehicle around an accurate seabed model. In this paper we consider two example case studies that use the Whole Field Modelling System for visualizing sonar data. Both case studies, visualizing real-time pipeline dredging and pipe restoration visualization, are implemented using real survey data.</p>

The objective of WFM is to provide the viewer with a new 3D underwater visualization environment which allows the user to pilot a virtual underwater vehicle, 'SRDl', around an accurate seabed model. This underwater model contains high-resolution' seabed terrain, gathered using the sonar Seabed Visualization System (SVS) <ref type="bibr">[3, lo]</ref>, and may contain any number of other objects such as pipelines and oilrigs etc. The user can pilot SRDl to areas of interest and may interact with a large database containing related information. For example, the user may pilot SRD 1 to a section of The sonar Seabed Visualization System gathers topographical data with a typical positional resolution of 5-10cm and a depth resolution of Icm. The interactive nature of a fly-over requires the terrain to be rendered at multiple levels of detail for rendering efficiency. 0-7803-5897-X/99/$10.00 Copyright 1999 IEEE . pipeline exposure3 where they can examine video footage from a particular section of pipeline captured usin8 video cameras mounted on a remotely operated vehicle <ref type="bibr">(ROV)</ref> .</p><p>The WFM system is being used to effectively model the seabed and provide the user with a more intuitive method for accessing large amounts of survey data. This method is in contrast to the traditional approach of printed survey charts. WFM allows the user to interact with a large visual database using little more than a joystick.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows a still from the WFM seabed visualization environment depicting depth textured seabed, an exposed section of pipeline, an imported oil-rig model and the SRDl user controlled vessel. The user can select from a number of external camera viewpoints. Selecting the SRDl cockpit viewpoint enables the viewer to pilot the SRDl vessel to a specific area of interest.</p><p>The WFM system consists of a single PC Pentium I1 system containing three Obsidian lOOSB graphics cards that allow rendering to three displays simultaneously (port, central and starboard views). One benefit of the Obsidian graphics card is that the central view can be connected directly to a video recorder through the SVHS-Out socket on the card.</p><p>A section of underwater pipeline can be in one of three categories: buried, exposed or free-spanning. A free-spanning pipe has lost all support from the seabed consequently increasing the strain and probability of pipeline fracture.

The user interacts with WFM using the Microsoft Force Feedback 'Sidewinder' joystick which was selected for its durability, large number of programmable buttons, and its inclusion of torque which is used to change SRDl's heading.</p><p>The WFM database contains all the seabed terrain and object information within the underwater environment including their positions and 'hotlink' associations. The user can select objects by firing a pseudo laser from SRDl at flight-time. The laser's vector is calculated for collision against objects within the environment. If a collision occurs then the system interrogates the internal database to see if that object is associated with a hotlink. An example hotlink might be audio information relating to the contents of a pipeline or corresponding video footage of the pipeline captured using video cameras mounted on an ROV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">CASE STUDIES</head><p>This section describes two seabed visualization case studies describing how WFM has been successhlly used to visualize sonar survey data returned from the Seabed Visualization System. The first case study considers real-time dredging visualization of a section of pipeline in Zeebrugge, Belgium. The second case study briefly describes how 3D models can be effectively imported into an underwater model allowing the user to visualize alternative techniques for pipeline restoration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Real-time Dredging Visualization</head><p>'Dredging' [7] is the process of relocating silt and sand from the seabed. This process uses dedicated vessels called 'Dredgers' that contain long 'hoppers' or arms that are ,lowered down and positioned directly over the seafloor. The 'dredge-head' at the end of the arm is carehlly positioned over the area to be dredged and a suction pump activated. Dredging is typically used for deepening a shipping channel and for underwater pipeline work.</p><p>SRD were commissioned to work alongside a dredging company to provide a sonar survey of a section of pipeline off the coast of Zeebrugge that had become exposed. The objective of the operation was to reduce the stress load on the pipe by dredging the seabed either side of the exposure, consequently lowering the pipeline to the seafloor.</p><p>The WFM system was extended to provide a real-time highresolution model of the dredging process, providing visualization of the seabed, underwater pipeline, dredging vessel and dredgehead. The crew of the dredging vessel would normally rely on simple echo sounders to manoeuvre their vessel and to position the dredgehead in the correct location. The real-time WFM visualization system provides the captain and crew of the vessel with a more intuitive 'natural' visualization of all the data ( <ref type="figure">Figure  2</ref>), facilitating the positioning of the vessel and dredge-head during the survey and dredging process.</p><p>A 3D model of the dredging vessel was created prior to the dredging survey using 3D Studio Max, based on the vessel's technical drawings. The dredgehead and arm were modelled as separate objects so they could be manipulated independently from the vessel at run-time. The 3D Studio models were then imported into the WFM database for on-line visualization. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows a snapshot from the real-time display including all the model components: dredging vessel and dredgehead, the 200 metre strip of seabed to be dredged, the exposed section of pipeline and the water level (viewable on the vessel's hull). Points 'A' and 'B' represent the extremities of the dredging survey and point 'C' highlights the dredge-head position above the pipe. The different seabed colours (visible in the colour plate) represent changes in seabed depth. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> describes the WFM transition and data-flow for real-time dredging visualization. Initially, the crew of the dredging vessel will start surveying from point 'A' to 'B' (depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>) using SRD's Seabed Visualization System. After approximately 15 minutes, the dredging vessel will reach point 'B' and the digital terrain maps (DTMs) and pipe information files will be created f?om the raw sonar data and loaded into the WFM system. This DTM conversion and import process takes less than 20 seconds and does not hinder the dredging process in any way. After surveying the seabed, the vessel starts dredging the seabed alongside the pipeline. The real-time visualization allows the captain to see the exact position and orientation of his vessel and dredgehead and their corresponding relationship to the seabed and pipeline. The Few of the dredging vessel can use this realtime viewing environment provided by WFM to manoeuvre the vessel and position the dredge-head.</p><p>The vessel will dredge the strip of seabed slowly returning to position 'A'. The WFM display also provides the captain with numerical information such as distance under keel (altitude), depth of dredge-head and the Eastings and Northings position of his vessel.</p><p>The real-time positioning of the dredging vessel and dredgehead is achieved through a serial link to the Seabed Visualization System which in turn is linked to GPS navigation and motion sensors. The serial string consists of a time stamp and the vessel's Easting, Northing, draft, heading (yaw), pitch and roll. The serial string also contains the dredgehead position which is identified as an offset from the centre of the vessel.</p><p>The WFM object database is updated with the new dredging positional data approximately three times per second. The object database is the main input to the rendering module that provides the real-time display. This display is updated continuously at 22Hz as the dredging vessel returns to point 'A'. At this stage dredging stops and the strip of seabed is surveyed again (A to B) to determine the effects of the latest dredging process. WFM updates its database with the new digital terrain maps and the process of dredging begins again. This cyclic survey-dredge survey process continues until the sonar returns from the top of the pipe reveal a similar depth to the supporting seabed, indicating that the pipe is no longer free-spanning.</p><p>During the dredging process, WFM allows the user to toggle between previous seabed datasets at runtime. This is a simple yet powerfbl facility enabling the user to see the cumulative effect of seabed scouring [ 1 11 caused by the dredging process. The seabed datasets imported into WFM after each survey can be seen in the colour plate associated with this paper <ref type="figure">(Figure 6</ref>). Note the sand ripples to the left of <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> representing an undredged seabed, and the large scour holes to the right of <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> caused by continuously activating the dredgehead pump at the same location on the seabed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Pipeline Restoration Visualization</head><p>During the Vis'98 conference, we introduced a technique for shipwreck visualization <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4]</ref> describing how the Seabed Visualization System could effectively overlay an accurate CAD model' of a ship (with centimetre accuracy) directly over the sunken vessel's sonar returns. These 3D objects that are inserted into the model do not necessarily have to be overlaid onto sonar returns. For example, it is possible to insert any 3D model into the underwater computer environment allowing the user to visualize how the seabed might be visually affected if these objects were part of the 'real world'.</p><p>Easington, off the East Coast of England, contains a large section of exposed pipeline that requires restoration in order to fix the pipeline to the seafloor and prevent further span development6. There are a number of possible techniques available to secure a section of exposed pipeline. For example: 'screwed anchors' that literally staple the pipe to the seafloor, 'rock dumps' which involve dropping large amounts of rock directly over the exposed section of pipeline, and 'concrete mattresses' (Colour Plate - <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>) that straddle the pipe with concrete. Building accurate models of the restoration objects, again using 3D Studio Max, enables the objects to be imported into an underwater sonar model and positioned directly over the pipe at intervals appropriate to the restoration technique used. For example, in the case of screwed anchors, they should be positioned at least every 20 metres along the pipeline.</p><p>c.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 4: Visualizing screwed anchors</head><p>Figure 4 depicts screwed anchor saddles positioned every 20 metres along a 28" diameter pipeline. The pipeline and seabed are real data gathered using the Seabed Visualization System. While visualizing the data, the pilot of SRDl can fly to any location and select any viewpoint. It is worth noting in the Easington example that when the seabed is viewed from a low altitude (directly over</p><p>The CAD model was generated using the original engineering drawings from the vessel.</p><p>Further span development would be caused either by scouring [ 1 I] or sliding movement of the pipeline. the pipe), the increased height caused by the pipe restoration object, for example the screwed anchors, is similar to the average surrounding sand wave height. This graphical evidence helped convince environmentalists that the pipe restoration devices were not as obtrusive to the underwater environment as originally thought.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">CONCLUSION</head><p>This case study paper has considered a Whole Field Modelling approach to seabed visualization by considering real-time pipeline dredging visualization in Zeebrugge, Belgium, and pipeline restoration visualization in Easington, England.</p><p>The real-time visualization of the pipeline dredging process has proved to be an effective visualization tool providing the crew of the dredging vessel with a more natural data visualization environment than existing on-line paper charts and echo sounder displays. The real-time display allows the captain to see the exact position and orientation of his vessel and dredge-head and their corresponding relationship to the seafloor and pipeline. This visualization tool can be used to manoeuvre the vessel and position the dredge-head in real-time.</p><p>Our second case study briefly described how pipe restoration devices such as screwed anchors and concrete mattresses could be imported into an accurate underwater 3D model and positioned directly over a section of exposed pipeline. This model can then be viewed in the interactive WFM fly-over system enabling the user to see the visual environmental effect of the various restoration techniques. In the Easington pipeline restoration example, the graphical evidence helped convince environmentalists that securing the sections of exposed pipeline would cause minimal disruption to the underwater environment.</p><p>The Whole Field Modelling system is still very much under development yet it has already proved to be an excellent seabed visualization tool facilitating planning and decision making. The real-time possibilities of the system are also very attractive providing new on-line visual displays for the captain and crew of survey vessels and providing accurate virtual environments for offshore applications. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Whole Field Modelling System</figDesc></figure>
