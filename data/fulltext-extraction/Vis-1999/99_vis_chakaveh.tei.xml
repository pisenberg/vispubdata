				<p>Perhaps the most effective instrument to simplify and to clarify the comprehension of any complex mathematical or scientific theory is through visualisation. Moreover using interactivity &amp; 3D real time representations, one can easily explore and hence learn quickly in the virtual environments. The concept of virtual and safe laboratories has vast potentials in education. With the aid of computer simulations &amp; 3D visualisations, many dangerous or cumbersome experiments may be implemented in the virtual environments, with rather small effort. Nonetheless visualisation alone is of little use if the respective simulation is not scientifically accurate. Hence a rigours combination of precise computation as well as sophisticated visualisation, presented through some intuitive user interface is required to realise a virtual laboratory for education. Here we introduce DeltaÕs Virtual Physics Laboratory, comprising of a wide range of applications in the field of Physics &amp; Astronomy, which can be implemented and used as an interactive learning tool on the World Wide Web.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Like many other aspects of our day to day life, the World Wide Web is also, drastically changing the way we learn. One innovative idea is to explore and develop virtual and safe laboratories on the Internet for learning purposes. One of the webÕs many valuable attributes is its capabilities for interaction, enabling the user to learn intuitively using trail and error when experimenting and exploring the Internet. With the aid of a primarily Webbased 3D description language known as Virtual Reality Modelling Language or (VRML) one may represent solutions of mathematical and scientific simulations as three-dimensional anima tions for a wider access. DELTAÕ Virtual Physics Laboratory (VPL) is one such learning platform which is developed by the Teleteaching research group Distance Education and Learning Telecommunication Applications (DELTA) of Institute for Media Communications (IMK) at GMD the German National Research Centre for Information Technology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">CONCEPT</head><p>VPL is a pilot project to develop a web-based 3D environment to cover a wide range of topics in Physics and Astronomy. The aim is to realise a general and comprehension of complex mathematical and scientific theories, through visualisation &amp; interaction. Nonetheless visualisation alone is of little use for learners if the respective simulation is inaccurate. Hence a rigours combination of precise computation as well as sophisticated visualisation, represented through some intuitive user interface is required to realise a virtual laboratory for educational purposes.</p><p>Since the Internet is the medium for which VPL is thought for, it is therefore plausible to treat the tool, also as a distributed or co-operative learning environment. i.e. any desired simulation may be carried out remotely on some fast computer, and only the required browsers or players may be installed locally. Thus there is a trade off between the speed of processing (when the programming is carried out locally) and the available bandwidth of the network (when it is performed remotely).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHOD</head><p>Although VPL consists of a wide range of different topics in Physics and Astronomy, the structure of each individual application is very similar. Namely it consists of three major parts: It is evident that Virtual Physics Laboratory is an extensive theme, comprising many different topics. The project, which started as small concept, has evolved to a Thus we may only refer to some selected applications, in here, which could prove scientifically stimulating, and may be demonstrated in a short presentation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">•</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Virtual Optical Bench (VOB)</head><p>Virtual Optical Bench (VOB) is a typical application of VPL, to simulate and to represent a complete optical laboratory in 3D for learning purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. V O B Õ s visualisation &amp; navigating aspects, aid learners to comprehend the optical phenomena simply by experimenting in a virtual laboratory. To implement VOB the raytracing code is written in the programming language C and further visualised using VRML.</p><p>In reality a typical optical bench consists of a hand full of components such as; Lenses, Mirrors, Beam Splitters, Gratings, Prisms, Filters, Light and Laser Sources. Real and virtual screens &amp; detectors can also be implemented and displaced to provide an optimised final result for a complete optical system. To investigate the accuracy of VOB some trivial practical examples were simulated using the virtual optical bench. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows a schematic of a raytrace of a cone of beam through a single lens. When considering this system a number of optical phenomena may be studied in detail, which are normally caused owing to different physical parameters such as lens curvatures, glass material or other inherent optical properties.</p><p>In this way common effects, caused by inherent properties of optical components such as spherical aberration, chromatic aberration, astigmatism or image distortion can easily be represented and hence investigated in detail. In addition to its didactic capabilities the Virtual Optical Bench may also be used as a complete raytracing package for optical system design. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows a schematic of an optical telescope consisting a lens, followed by a mirror receiving light from some system of binary stars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DIDACTIC ANALYSIS AND RESULTS</head><p>In practice the chances for average pupils, to be able to experiment on some real optical bench could be rather remote. Most optical elements are costly, fairly fragile or sensitive to handle. Unlike real components there are no fears to damage the VOBÕs optical elements, so the user can freely experiment and therefore learn about this phenomena, using trail and error.</p><p>To analyse VPLÕs didactic effects and its implications in the teaching and learning environments, the tool was tested by a number of educators and students. To our great delight and amazement we discovered overwhelming positive response from the users. Students regard visualisation as an enormous aid to comprehend complex themes. The interactivity of virtual laboratories enable them to experiment on the web at their own convenience, with total confidence to overcome the fears of damaging or destroying any equipment or set-ups. Teachers refer to VPL as a tool that not only facilitate representations and drawings for their lectures but also brings about a new learning motivation for their students, enabling them to grasp the main scientific theme of each subject in considerably shorter time. Although VPL is designed to serve as a learning platform for Physics and Astronomy, its general concept may equally be applied to a number of subject areas such as Chemistry, Biology or Engineering. In short VPLÕs structure may be implemented for any subject where the scientific concept may be represented mathematically. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 Fig. 1</head><label>21</label><figDesc>Schematic represents beams through a Maksutov Telescope.
