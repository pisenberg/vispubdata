				<p>We present BARD (biological arc diagrams), a visualization tool for biological sequence analysis. The development of BARD began with the application of Wattenberg&apos;s arc diagrams [Wattenberg 2002] to results from sequence analysis programs, such as BLAST [Altschul et al. 1990]. In this paper, we extend the initial arc diagram concept in two ways: 1) by separating the visualization method from the underlying matching algorithm and 2) by expanding the types of matches to include inexact matches, complemented palindrome matches, and inter-sequence matches. BARD renders each type of match distinctly, resulting in a powerful tool to quickly understand sequence similarities and differences. We illustrate the power of BARD by applying the technique to a comparative sequence analysis of the human pathogenic fungi Cryptococcus neoformans.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The identification of sequence function is an integral part of computational biology. Sequence analysis is the process of identifying a sequence's biological function by comparison to another sequence (pairwise alignment) or other sequences (multiple alignments). The basis of functional assertions on uncharacterized sequences is the degree of similarity between the uncharacterized sequence and a sequence with an experimentally-verified function. The success of computational characterization is measured by the number of sequences with known function, the degree of sequence conservation, and the evolutionary relationship of the sequences being compared.</p><p>The number of unidentified sequences in sequence databases continues to out pace the number of known se- * e-mail: rus1@duke.edu quences. Therefore, computational biologists are expanding sequence comparison algorithms in an effort to identify similar sequences between more distantly related organisms. In addition, biologists seek to understand sequence function through sequence conservation in groups of closely related organisms. Although such analysis is beneficial in summarizing similarities between raw sequence data, the process has the side effect of creating more data. For instance, a comparative analysis of one megabase (1x10 9 basepairs) from the mouse genome and the human genome can easily result in thousands of similar regions between the organisms. Visualization is an indispensable tool in supporting analysis of this data.</p><p>There are numerous approaches to visualize sequence similarity in bioinformatics. These include applications to visualize similarity between two sequences, shared similarity between multiple sequences, and visualizations of genome-wide alignments. Each approach has limitations that are related to either the inability to accurately reflect relationships in complex sequence structure, or the inability to show shared and unique patterns in multiple sequences. This paper describes the extension of arc diagrams to biological sequences, the modifications necessary to enable this extension, and provides an example of how the visualization can be used in multiple sequence analysis. The potential for the tool to assist in the analysis of large scale comparative genome analysis is particularly exciting.</p><p>The following sections review existing visualization tools for sequence analysis, details our extension to arc diagrams in the development of BARD, and provides an example application in comparative genomics. We conclude this paper by describing some lessons learned and our plans for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Current methods for sequence visualization</head><p>Dotplots remain a common and informative tool for quickly summarizing the relationship of similarities between two sequences. Originally introduced in 1970 by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gibbs and McIntyre [1970]</ref>, dotplots are a self-similarity matrix, where the sequence is plotted on both axes and a point is placed in the matrix wherever the same base occurs in the sequence. Dotplots are useful for identifying insertions and deletions within a sequence. In this manner, repetitive elements such as tandem repeats, gene duplications, and RNA stem loop structures can be identified. Dotplots, however, become difficult to interpret as the number of repetitive elements in a single sequence and shared subsequences between sequences increases. A local alignment between two genomes produces a set of regions which share similarity above an algorithm specified IEEE Symposium on Information <ref type="bibr">Visualization 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, October 19-21, 2003</ref>, Seattle, Washington, USA 0-7803-8154-8/03/$17.00 ©2003 IEEE threshold. A Percent Identity Plot (PIP) is used to visualize the results of genome-wide local alignments. PIPmaker <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Schwartz et al. 2000]</ref> and VISTA <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[Mayor et al. 2000]</ref> are software tools that utilize PIPs. A PIP plots the results of alignments with the percentage of identical bases on the yaxis and the coordinates of the base pairs on the x-axis. For long genomic sequences the graph is plotted on multiple horizontal axes. A horizontal line is plotted at the location of a local alignment with a vertical displacement equal to the average percent identity for that region. PIPs are very helpful in displaying conserved regions between genomes. This is useful in identifying both coding regions (regions which code for a functional biological product such as a protein) and non-coding regions, such as promoters. A limitation of PIPs and VISTA is that they are not as useful in displaying co-linearity between sequences because the sequences displayed are relative to one genome. PIPs are also limited to displaying comparisons between two sequences. Example dotplots and PIPs are presented and contrasted with BARD in section 4.4.</p><p>The arc diagram <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[Wattenberg 2002</ref>] is a visualization tool that assists in conceptualizing the patterns in repetitive structures found in strings. Arc diagrams are designed to clearly visualize exact repetitive subsequences in a single string by reducing the number of visual elements needed to represent the structure of the string. N-1 arcs are drawn in a string with N repeats compared with N 2 lines in a dotplot.</p><p>In applying arc diagram visualizations to biological sequences, Wattenberg's implementation is directly applicable to the special case of exact matches in a single sequence. BARD expands Wattenberg's approach by making the visualization independent of the underlying matching algorithm, and expanding the types of matches that can be rendered.</p><p>3 Extensions to arc diagrams</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Algorithm Independence</head><p>There are a several algorithms used in molecular biology to analyze repeating subsequences in genetic strings. Tools such as BLAST <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Altschul et al. 1990</ref>] find local alignments to a query sequence. Other tools such as WABA <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Kent and Zahler 2000]</ref> perform global similarity matches. In order to support all sequence matching software, BARD accepts input in the standard General Feature Format (GFF) [The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute 2003]. Parsers can be written which translate the output of an algorithm into GFF format to enable visualization of the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Additional match types</head><p>The central task of the arc diagram algorithm is to find the minimum subset of repetitive elements necessary to represent all repetitive elements in a sequence and connect them with arcs. A member of this minimum set is called an essential matching pair (EMP). A matching pair is defined as two tuples, each with the start and end sequence coordinates of two identical subsequences. The first tuple is referred to as the source and the second tuple is referred to as the hit. In order to define essential matching pairs, we must first define maximal pairs, repeat regions, and the fundamental pattern of a repeat region.</p><p>Panels 1 through 4 in figure 1 illustrate the four conditions of a maximal pair. The definition of a repeat region is shown in panel 5 of figure 1. A maximal pair is an identical hit and source subsequence, that is non-overlapping, consecutive, and maximal. In panel 1 subsequences i and j have the same symbols and are identical. In panel 2, subsequences i and j fail the non-overlapping condition. In panel 3, the match formed from subsequences i and j and the match formed from subsequences j and k are consecutive. The match formed from subsequences i and k would not be consecutive because subsequence j occurs between i and k. Notice that the consecutive condition reduces the set of matches from three to two, but maintains the concept that all of the subsequences are equal. In panel 4, subsequences i and j fail the maximal condition because each subsequence can be extended without breaking the match.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T T C G T C A C G T C A C G T C A T T T T C G T C A C G T C A C G T C A T T T T C G T C A C G T C A C G T C A T T i j Identical: T T C G T C A C G T C A C G T C A T T Non-overlapping: Consecutive: Maximal: j i i j k j i T T C G T C A C G T C A C G T C A T T Repeat region: Fundamental pattern: C G T C A</formula><p>Panel 5 of figure 1 illustrates a repeat region. A repeat region is defined by the same subsequence occurring two or more times in succession. The repeated subsequence is the fundamental pattern. In Panel 5, the fundamental pattern is 'CGTCA'.</p><p>The three types of EMPs are:</p><p>• A maximal pair that does not occur in a repetitive region</p><p>• A maximal pair in the same fundamental pattern in a repeat region</p><p>• Consecutive occurrences of the fundamental pattern in a repeat region <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, panels 1-3 illustrate these three EMPs types. From Panel 1, (i,j ) is an EMP because it is a maximal pair that does not occur in a repetitive region. For matches in a repeat region there are two types of EMPs; from panel 2, (i,j ) is an EMP because it is formed from a maximal pair in the same fundamental pattern, and from panel 3, (i,j ) and (j,k ) are EMPs because they are consecutive occurrences of the fundamental pattern of a repeat region. See figure 3 for the BARD visualization of this sequence.</p></div>

A non-exact match is a match where the similarity of the hit and source is determined by the sequence analysis program. For example, an algorithm may consider sequences with 95% similarity or higher identical. The transformation of matches determined by sequence analysis programs to EMPs differs based on whether the match is exact, inexact, or a reverse strand match. In the case of exact matches, BARD reduces to the Wattenberg implementation. BARD's treatment of inexact and reversestrand matches are described in the next two sections. Section 3.2.3 applies BARD to matches between multiple sequences.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">j i i j k T T C G T C A C G T C A C G T C A T T</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Inexact Matches</head><p>Inexact matches allow for non-matching characters at the same position in two subsequences. Inexact subsequences are considered matches if the score, as computed by the alignment tool, of the two aligned sequences has a value above a scoring threshold. See Durbin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Durbin et al. 2001</ref>] for a thorough treatment of sequence alignment scoring.</p><p>Care must be taken when transforming inexact matches with EMPs because they do not have the transitivity property of exact matches. For example, consider an algorithm's output set that includes a match (A,B) and (A,C). In the case of an exact match, BARD would replace the nonconsecutive match (A,C) with (B,C) to satisfy the consecutive condition of a maximal pair (figure 1, panel 3). This operation is not necessarily valid in the case of inexact matches because (B,C) might not be considered a match based on the alignment tool's evaluation.</p><p>BARD solves this problem by requiring the algorithm's match set to be exhaustive. BARD does not add any matches to the match set from an inexact algorithm. However, BARD will remove a non-consecutive match if the set includes the corresponding consecutive match. For instance using the example above, if a match set includes (A,B), (A,C), and (B,C) then match (A,C) will be deleted. However, if the match set includes (A,B) and (A,C) then match (B,C) will not be added. BARD uses the same arc icon for exact and inexact matches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Reverse strand matches</head><p>DNA is a double stranded molecule with the two strands present in opposite orientation. Features (i.e genes, promoters, binding sites) can be either on the "top strand" (forward strand) or the "bottom strand" (reverse strand). Other features can appear on either strand (i.e. binding sites, restriction enzyme sites). Conventionally, the forward strand is read from the left (5 end) to right (3 end), and the reverse strand is read from the 3 end to the 5 end.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A T G C ---G C A T ---G C A T T A C G ---C G T A ---C G T A 5'</head><p>3'</p><p>A B C <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Reverse strand match with complementary bases.</p><p>A complemented palindrome match is a match in a DNA sequence where the two subsequences are complements of one another. In DNA, A and T are complementary and G and C are complementary. A reverse complement palindrome match, or reverse strand match, is a match where one subsequence is the complement of the reverse of the other subsequence. This corresponds to two matching subsequences on opposite strands. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows a reverse strand match of subsequence A with subsequences B and C. Reverse strand matches can be exact or inexact. BARD renders the arcs due to reverse strand matches beneath the axis in red to symbolize that the match is between subsequences that are reverse complements of one another. Given a set of reverse strand matches BARD reduces the non-consecutive matches where possible. The same logic as described in the previous section is used to process exact and inexact reverse strand matches. Given an exact reverse strand match set that includes non-consecutive matches (A,B) and (A,C), BARD replaces (A,C) with match (B,C). Note that subsequences B and C occur on the reverse strand, see figure 4. Since DNA is complementary a match between B and C on the reverse strand is equivalent to a match between B and C on the forward strand. BARD renders any match that is added to a set of exact matches as a green arc beneath the axis. The green arc differentiates these added matches from the reverse complement matches rendered in red as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 5</ref>.</p><p>Rendering a set of matches that are repeated on the forward and reverse strands results in interesting visual patterns. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref> is a BARD rendering of a DNA sequence with known binding domains. Notice the swooshing arcs, labeled a and b. The arc a corresponds to two reverse strand matches connected by a forward strand match. The arc b corresponds to two reverse strand matches. The sources of the matches have the same start position, but differ in length by one base pair. The hits of the two matches are spanned by a forward match. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Multiple sequence matches</head><p>Matches between multiple sequences can be thought of as repetitive elements within a super sequence that is the concatenation of the sequences. BARD utilizes this simplification to visualize multiple pairwise sequence alignments. Each sequence is rendered on the horizontal axis separated by white space. The algorithms described in sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 are then used to connect the different classes of matches between all of the sequences. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref> shows a four-way multiple pairwise alignment with exact matches. The interpretation of figure 7 is described in section 4.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Implementation</head><p>BARD has been implemented in Java and tested on an 800Mhz Macintosh PowerPC and a Pentium4 Linux workstation. It takes BARD approximately 10 seconds to evaluate and display the matches of a 450 kb (1kb = 1000 nucleotide pairs) sequence.</p><p>The program reads in GFF files to obtain the potential matches to be displayed. Non-consecutive matches which can be eliminated are identified. Repetitive regions are identified by matches with intersecting coordinates. The fundamental pattern, or period of the repeat region, is calculated by the length of the intersecting region. The diagram is then rendered by drawing arcs connecting all matches that are not in repeat regions. The repeat regions are rendered with arcs connecting the fundamental pattern of the region.</p><p>A beta web version of the application has been developed as a java servlet. The current implementation takes a GFF file of matches and the corresponding FASTA format sequence file and produces a JPEG image of the arc diagram. 4 A comparative sequence analysis application</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Motivation</head><p>The goal of comparative genomics is to identify the unique and conserved functional elements in different genomes. Primary tasks in comparative genomics include:</p><p>• identification of conserved coding and non-coding regions between genomes</p><p>• identification of differences in coding and non-coding regions between genomes</p><p>• identification of sequences that show relationships which are inconsistent with evolutionary models</p><p>• identification of evolutionary events, such as chromosome duplication BARD is being utilized for all four of these tasks in a comparative genomic study of different strains of Cryptococcus neoformans at the Duke University Mycology Research Unit (DUMRU).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Biological background</head><p>C. neoformans is an opportunistic pathogenic fungi that causes meningoencephalitis in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Heitman et al. 1999]</ref>. Cryptococcal infections are common in individuals with compromised immune systems, although infection is also possible in normally functioning immuno patients. Infections are most common among infants, transplant recipients, and AIDS patients. Among AIDS patients life threatening incidents of cryptococcal infections has been estimated between 6% to 10% in the United States. Mortality within 12 months of diagnosis has been reported to be 30% to 60% for these patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[Mitchell and Perfect 1995]</ref>. Two species of Cryptococcus, C. neoformans variety grubii (serotype A) and C. neoformans variety neoformans (serotype D) are currently being sequenced. The sequencing efforts are supporting a larger investigation of the pathogenic mechanisms of Cryptococcus. Studies have shown that virulence is correlated with the mating type (MAT) of the fungii. MATα strains are more virulent than MATa <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Casadevall and Perfect 1998</ref>] <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[Kwon-Chung et al. 1992</ref>]. In addition, serotype A is more virulent than serotype D <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Casadevall and Perfect 1998</ref>]. The MAT locus, a region of the genome demarcated by relative or absolute coordinates, for both mating types of serotype A and D have been sequenced. Currently, the sequences are being investigated for the presence of sequence differences which may highlight the unique pathogenicity and function between the strains.</p><p>BARD has been used to visualize the sequence features of the four MAT sequences. In the next section, we provide two BARD images of the MAT loci (one or more locus) and discuss how different biologically interesting features in sequence space appear in the arc diagram visualization. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref> shows a BARD generated diagram for 2 kilobases from the 5 end of the mating type loci in 2 strains of Cryptococcus. The arcs connect exact matches between DNA words of length 30 or greater on the forward strand. The axis of the figure shows the mating type loci from serotype A and serotype D. Beneath the axis are annotations that correspond to the genomic region.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">BARD visualization</head><p>The flanking region, denoted as A, is the region of shared similarity between the four sequences that marks the beginning of the mating type loci. The flanking region arcs identify regions that are contained in all four MAT loci, visualized as a set of bouncing arcs with termination points in the flanking region. Notice the twisting visual effect from the set of arcs that connect the flanking regions. This visual feature denotes synteny; the preservation of the order of genomic features between sequences.</p><p>In contrast, unique features between the four sequences are denoted by B in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">figure 7</ref>. This region corresponds to the gene SXI1. The SXI1 arcs indicate an element unique to the MATα locus. The SXI1 gene establishes sexual identity in Cryptococcus cells and is the first gene discovered that is involved in the sexual differentiation of the organism <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Hull et al. 2002]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref> shows a BARD visualization of the entire 100kb MAT loci from serotype A and D of Cryptococcus. The arcs in this diagram correspond to inexact matches of DNA words 2000 to 3000 bases in length. The arcs above the axis correspond to inexact matches on the forward strand and matches below the axis correspond to inexact matches on the reverse strand. In closely related species the expectation is that there is a high degree of similarity between their respective sequences. In BARD this would be rendered as wide arcs connecting all of the MAT sequences. The fact that it is difficult to find global patterns of arcs in the diagram is of biological interest. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref> shows the high number of genomic rearrangements and non-conserved sequences between the MAT locus within a single Cryptococcus species and between the closely related serotype A and D strains. It is hypothesized that this maybe a manifestation, at the sequence level, of functional differences in the organism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Comparison to existing methods</head><p>A Percent Identity Plot, dotplot, and BARD from the same sequence analysis were generated to compare the visualiza-  longer. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref> is a PIP generated from mVISTA <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Dubchak et al. 2000]</ref>. The MATα sequence is represented on the x-axis. The graph shows the percentage of identical bases between subsequences from MATa aligned to MATα. The percent identity ranges from 50% to 100%. The PIP is useful in determining the degree of conservation between sequences. The regions labelled A, B, and C depict conserved regions between the sequences. Region A is a highly conserved region (percent identity between 90% and 100%). Regions B and C are less conserved regions (percent identity approx. 55%). The PIP does not show the location of the matching regions on the aligned sequences. The locations of regions A, B, and C on the MATa sequence can not be determined for the graph. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> is a dotplot generated from the EMBOSS <ref type="bibr">[2003]</ref> utility dottup. The dotplot displays the location of exact matching sub-sequences of length 10bp or greater between the two MAT sequences. The regions labeled A,B1,B2, and C indicate four regions of identity. Lines plotted on the diagonal indicate sub-sequences that are in the same position on both sequences (e.g. regions A, B1, and C). Lines that are parallel to the diagonal, such as region B2, indicate repeated regions in a sequence. Region B2 indicates a subsequence near the 3 end of MAT A which is a repeat of region B1. Notice that the presence of a repeat region in MAT A is not evident in figure 9. The dotplot provides an overview of the relationship between two sequences. However, as discussed previously the dotplot is difficult to interpret as the number of repeated sequences increases. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> is a subset of figure 7 and is generated from the same analysis depicted in figure 10. The BARD image displays the location of matches within the respective sequences. The regions labeled A, B1, B2, and C indicate matching subsequences between the two MAT sequences. Region A depicts the synteny of the matches between the sequences at the 5 end. Regions B1 and B2 are subsequences that are repeated in MATa as indicated by the two arcs that terminate at the same location in MATα. Notice that the ordering of regions B1, B2, and C is clearer in figure 11 than in figure 10. The BARD image displays matches within context of their location in the sequence and their relationship between other matches. This contextual presentation is of interest when trying to deduce evolutionary events that have altered a sequence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Lessons Learned</head><p>The development of BARD is being conducted in an interactive process with the end users. Initial feedback from geneticists at the Center for Genome Technology and DUMRU has been positive. Specifically, researchers involved in the Cryptococcus project are excited about the illustrative power of BARD. Currently, they struggle to present the different orientations of shared functional elements in the MAT loci and feel that BARD will be useful in presenting this information. For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 8 and figure 12</ref> illustrate the use of BARD in communicating this concept. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> shows selected arcs from figure 8 which highlight a particular region of sequence conservation. A biologist interpreting figure 12 would immediately see that the region of interest is repeated in the forward direction of A MATA,A MATα, and D MATA, and the reverse direction of D MATα.  The ability to simultaneously present information on the forward and reverse strands has contributed significantly to the expressive power of the visualizations. The twisting visual effect from syntenic regions and the "bouncing arcs" have been helpful in expressing common features between the sequences. In addition, the visualization of genomic rearrangements, insertions, and deletions has been helpful in presenting evolutionary divergence between the sequences, as shown in figures 7 through 8. Sequence divergence is an important research area in Cryptococcus because virulence differences between serotypes is hypothesized to be a result of speciation. In general researchers are comfortable interpreting the visualizations once they have been introduced to the iconography.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Future work</head><p>Several areas have been identified to improve BARD's use as a predictive discovery tool by users and the developer. While BARD currently has the ability to filter the display by the length of the match, the most common request from users is the ability to filter by other criteria. These include: the ability to filter matches by gene name and location and filtering by the sequences that contain a set of connected arcs. Secondly, BARD needs a way to incorporate the quality of the alignment into the visualization. This would help answer questions about the degree of conservation between genes which occur in many different organisms.</p><p>For multiple sequence arc diagrams the order in which the sequences are placed on the horizontal axis will not affect the rendering. However, different patterns will be highlighted in different orderings of the sequences. An algorithm for ordering the sequences would be helpful in identifying unexpected similarity relationships. Initial thoughts are to order the sequences on the axis by their phylogenetic relationships. It is hypothesized that arcs connecting more distant sequences in this approach may indicate unexpected conservation between distantly related sequences, or erroneous assumptions in underlying models of evolution.</p><p>Finally, an improved user interface is necessary to support discovery and predictive tasks using the visualization. Efforts to implement a Zoomable User Interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Bederson et al. 2000]</ref> are being considered. ZUIs are suited to support visualization tasks in large information sets, and should be an effective tool for interacting with visualizations of sequence comparisons between 3 or more large sequences.</p><p>Additional BARD applications are in the planning stages. One extension is to visualize sequence comparisons with alternative scoring matrices. For instance, a current project involves using BARD to visualize predictions of beta-sheets from protein sequences. The scoring matrix used is based on para-potential models of protein.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>This paper introduced the Biological Arc Diagram visualization tool, BARD. We extended the original Arc Diagram concept of exact repetitive patterns in strings to patterns that are relevant in biological sequences. We presented algorithms for determining essential matching pairs from inexact matches, reverse strand matches, and multiple sequence matches. In addition, we designed BARD to explicitly depict the orientation of shared functional elements by rendering arcs both above and below the sequence line depending on whether a matched pair is on the forward or reverse DNA strand. Initial feedback from scientists in the DUMRU that used BARD as a comparative genomic tool were very positive. Specifically, BARD's visualizations have already been proved useful for clearly showing syntenic sequence regions, and highlighting genomic rearrangements that show sequence divergence due to evolution.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Maximal and repeat region conditions.</figDesc></figure>
