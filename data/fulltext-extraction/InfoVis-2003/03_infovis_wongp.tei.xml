			<abstract>
				<p>We introduce two dynamic visualization techniques using multidimensional scaling to analyze transient data streams such as newswires and remote sensing imagery. While the time-sensitive nature of these data streams requires immediate attention in many applications, the unpredictable and unbounded characteristics of this information can potentially overwhelm many scaling algorithms that require a full re-computation for every update. We present an adaptive visualization technique based on data stratification to ingest stream information adaptively when influx rate exceeds processing rate. We also describe an incremental visualization technique based on data fusion to project new information directly onto a visualization subspace spanned by the singular vectors of the previously processed neighboring data. The ultimate goal is to leverage the value of legacy and new information and minimize reprocessing of the entire dataset in full resolution. We demonstrate these dynamic visualization results using a newswire corpus and a remote sensing imagery sequence.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Advancements in telecommunications and high-speed networks have recently created a new category of digital information known as data streams <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Babcock et al. 2002]</ref>. This time-varying information has the unique characteristic of arriving continuously, unpredictably, and unboundedly without any persistent patterns. Data stream examples include newswires, Internet click streams, network resource measurements, phone call records, and remote sensing imagery. The increasing demands of immediate analyses and actions on these transient data streams in many time-sensitive applications such as Homeland Security have spawned a series of investigations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Babu and Widom 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cortes et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Domingos and Hulten 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">O'Callaghan et al. 2002</ref>] to query, mine, and model the information through non-traditional approaches. This paper focuses on finding a visual-based solution to the fast growing research area with demonstrations using text and imagery streams.</p><p>Generally, visualizing transient data streams requires fusing a large amount of previously analyzed information with a smaller amount of new information. This new information is at least as important as its larger counterpart because the resultant visualization is entirely dependent on the dataset and the user parameters applied to it. Thus, the whole dataset must be reprocessed in full resolution in order to capture the finest details. In reality, this is a challenging task given the unbounded and unpredictable nature of the streams.</p><p>Our first objective is to develop an adaptive visualization technique that allows one to get the best understanding of the transient data streams adaptively during critical moments when influx rate exceeds processing rate. Our approach is built on the concept of data stratification that intelligently reduces the data size in exchange for substantial reduction of processing time. Although we only use classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Cox and Cox 1994]</ref> in our investigation, our adaptive technique will work well with other scaling methods because we only modify the data, not the scaling algorithms that process it.</p><p>Our second objective is to develop an incremental visualization technique that allows one to project a certain amount of new information incrementally onto an orthogonal subspace spanned by the most important singular vectors of the previously processed data. The design is based on a multiple sliding window concept that uses dominant Eigenvectors obtained from a large data window to accommodate the information from a smaller data window without re-processing the entire dataset.</p><p>The primary visualization output of an MDS process is a lowdimensional scatterplot in which pairwise distances between any points reflect the similarities of the items represented by the points. Because a large part of our work is based on progressive approximation and adaptation, error-tracking plays a vital role in showing the viability of our work. We use both visual-and computational-based means extensively to compare multiple scatterplots simultaneously and report their discrepancies.</p><p>Our ultimate goal is to leverage the value of legacy and new information and minimize re-processing the entire dataset in full resolution. Our approach is to turn a prevailing and widespread visualization tool (i.e., MDS), which was initially developed for analyzing static data collections, into a dynamic data analysis tool for transient data streams. This paper explains the motivations and provides critical technologies to accomplish such a dynamic analysis environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Although the study of data streams is relatively new to the visualization community, it gradually has become one of the most pressing and difficult data problems in today's information technology (IT) world. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Babcock et al. [2002]</ref> presented an overview paper that defines the topic, describes the background, and introduces challenging issues of this young research area. Among the hot research topics are dynamic query <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Babu and Widom 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">O' Callaghan et al. 2002]</ref> and data mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Cortes et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Domingos and Hulten 2000]</ref> of the transient streams.</p><p>MDS has always been an important part of information visualization studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wise et al. [1995]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Wise [1999]</ref> used MDS to analyze large corpora. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bentley and Ward [1996]</ref> studied the stress property of a class of MDS known as non-metric multidimensional scaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Cox and Cox 1994]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Wong and Bergeron [1997]</ref> applied MDS in a high-dimensional brushing and linking visualization environment. And more recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Morrison et al. [2002]</ref> reported a new MDS technique that algorithmically outperforms all previous implementations. Many of these MDS-based applications can potentially take advantage of our adaptive technique and further improve performance.</p><p>This paper uses both text and imagery streams for demonstrations. The text visualization community has largely been influenced by two groundbreaking works: 1) <ref type="bibr">Salton and McGill's Vector Space Model (VSM)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Salton and McGill 1983</ref>] that represents the documents as numerical vectors, and 2) <ref type="bibr">Deerwester et al.'s Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Deerwester et al. 1990</ref>] that effectively projects the vectors into an Eigenspace based on a classical MDS design. Many successful commercial text visualization systems today-such as Aureka <ref type="bibr">[ ] OmniViz [2003</ref>, SPIRE <ref type="bibr">[Wise 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wise et al. 1995]</ref>, Starlight <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[Risch et al. 1997], and</ref><ref type="bibr">VxInsight [2003]</ref>-were developed based on these two models.</p><p>In addition to document visualization, researchers use MDS to analyze a large number of static images and query their features. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Rodden et al. [1999]</ref> present a novel image scatterplot without overlapping. Of particular note is that the prior work presented here has assumed a static data collection, which is very different from the dynamic data streams discussed in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DEMONSTRATION DATASET AND PRE-PROCESSING</head><p>We use a newswire corpus and a remote imagery sequence for demonstrations. We describe the datasets and pre-processing steps to generate the required vectors (which represent individual units) and matrices (which represent the whole dataset) for MDS analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Document Corpus</head><p>The demo corpus has 3,298 news articles collected from open sources during April 20-26, 1995. It has a strong theme associated with the bombing of the U.S. Federal Building in Oklahoma, the O.J. Simpson trial, and the French elections.</p><p>The first step in processing the corpus is to identify a set of content-bearing words <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Bookstein et al. 1998</ref>] from the documents. Words separated by white spaces in a corpus are evaluated within the context of the corpus to assess whether a word is interesting enough to be a topic. The co-occurrence or lack of co-occurrence of these words in documents is used to evaluate the strengths of the words.</p><p>The second step is to construct the document vectors for the corpus. A document vector, which is an array of real numbers, contains the weighted strengths of the interesting words found in the corresponding document. These vectors are normalized and the result is a document matrix that represents the corpus. In our example, a document vector contains 200 numbers. Because there are 3,298 documents, the dimensions of the document matrix are 3,298×200. Details of our text engine can be found in <ref type="bibr">[Wise 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wise et al. 1995]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Remote Sensing Imagery</head><p>The remote sensing imagery sequence used in our demonstration was taken by an aircraft over the semi-desert area in Eastern Washington. The aircraft was equipped with a hyperspectral sensor that could take multiple images of the same locations simultaneously in different spectral bands. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1a</ref> illustrates the basic concept of the scanning operation.</p><p>The processing of the remote imagery information is straightforward. We want to extract features of the area by analyzing the similarities of the image pixels from different spectral bands. In our examples in Sections 6.4 and 8, the image in each spectral band (or layer) has 32×128=4096 pixels, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1b</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1c</ref> depicts a color infrared (CIR) image shot in infrared band. A pixel vector, in this case, contains image information of the same pixel position across the 169 spectral bands. In other words, each pixel position establishes a pixel vector. Because there are 4,096 pixels in each image, the dimensions of the pixel matrix are 4,096×169.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING</head><p>MDS is a prevailing technique used to visualize high-dimensional datasets. There are a variety of proven MDS algorithms designed for different analytical purposes. (Readers are directed to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Cox and Cox 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">MDS 2003</ref>] for a comprehensive overview.) Our investigation focuses on a class of MDS known as classical scaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Cox and Cox 1994]</ref>. To show the flexibility of our design approach, we also include an example in Section 6.3 using a leastsquares-based scaling technique known as Sammon Projection <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[Sammon 1969]</ref>.</p><p>Given a high-dimensional dataset (a set of similar data objects represented by numerical vectors), MDS generates a lowdimensional configuration-like a 2-D scatterplot-such that the pairwise distances between any points in the low-dimensional space approximate the similarities between the vectors that represent the points. For example, <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows a scatterplot with 3,298 points (each point represents a document vector) generated by a classical MDS process using the corpus described in Section 3.1. In this example, documents with similar themes are clustered together as annotated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">ADAPTIVE VISUALIZATION USING STRATIFICATION</head><p>We present an adaptive visualization technique based on data stratification to substantially reduce the processing time of the streams and yet maintain the overall integrity of the MDS visualization output. The data ingest scheme that supports the technique is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. If the primary data processing route (the blue pipe) has overflowed, the data are re-directed to a  secondary one (the green pipe), which generates a coarser version of visualization but at a much faster processing rate. And when the green pipe has overflowed, too, the data go to the red one and so on. The two data stratification strategies presented in this paper are vector dimension reduction and vector sampling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Vector Dimension Reduction</head><p>Our first stratification strategy is to cut down the dimensions of the data vectors. The biggest challenge is to reduce the physical size of the vectors but maintain most of their important contents. We accomplish this by applying dyadic wavelets <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[Strang 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Mallat 1998</ref>] to decompose individual vectors (and thus compress them) progressively. While the theory of wavelets is extensive, our experiments show that the Haar wavelets perform well in all our visualizations. Not surprisingly, the basic Haar also outperforms all the other wavelet candidates in processing time, which is considered a top priority for analyzing data streams <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Gilbert et al. 2001]</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows an example of two consecutive wavelet decompositions on a document vector randomly selected from the demo corpus (described in Section 3.1.) <ref type="figure">Figure 4a</ref> is the original vector with 200 terms. <ref type="figure">Figure 4b</ref> is the result of the first wavelet decomposition with 100 terms. <ref type="figure">Figure 4c</ref> is the result of the second wavelet decomposition with 50 terms. Because Haar belongs to the dyadic wavelet family, one wavelet application will reduce the vector dimension by 50%. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows the feature-preserving property of wavelets on individual vectors, the next example demonstrates the accuracy of the resultant vectors in generating visualizations using MDS. We start with the same scatterplot shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, which is generated using a full-resolution matrix of the demo corpus. In order to give visual identities to the scatter points, we apply a K-mean <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[Seber 1984</ref>] process to the 2D scatterplot and subdivide the points into four clusters. Each cluster receives a unique color (shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5a</ref> as magenta, cyan, grey, and yellow) for point identification throughout the discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>While the example in</head><p>Using wavelets, we then progressively reduce the dimensions of the document vectors from 200, to 100, and then to 50. Each reduction is followed by an MDS process; the visualization results are shown in <ref type="figure">Figures 5b and 5c</ref>. Although the orientations and spreads of the scatter points vary slightly in <ref type="figure">Figures 5b and 5c</ref>, major features such as clustering and separation remain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Vector Sampling</head><p>Our second stratification strategy is to reduce the number of data vectors based on sampling. We use a regular sampling technique to obtain an even data distribution in our example. Other sampling options such as a statistical-based distribution can also be applied.</p><p>We first repeat the initial two steps (i.e., generate scatterplot using all 3,298 document vectors and assign color identities to each scatter point) of the last example. Instead of reducing the dimensions of the vectors, this time we progressively reduce the number of document vectors by 50% every time using a regular sampling method. Each sampling process is followed by another MDS to project a scatterplot based on the sampled input. The results are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.</p><p>The three visualizations in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> demonstrate that even though we substantially reduce the number of vectors for the MDS process, the shape or spread of the points remains more or less the same. This phenomenon can be explained by the stability of the two most important Eigenvectors generated by the highly related document vectors. This property also lays the foundation of the data fusion method discussed later in the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DATA STRATIFICATION OPTIONS AND RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we discuss the results of the two stratification strategies and their impacts on the resultant visualizations. Our discussion focuses on computation performance and the flexibility in dealing with different data types and different scaling methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Scatterplot Matrix</head><p>To improve the visualization for comparison and evaluation, we progressively combine the two approaches and concatenate their results into a scatterplot matrix. The scatterplot matrix in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref> shows the consequences of reducing document vectors (row) versus reducing vector dimensions (column).</p><p>The results indicate that although the shape of the point distribution changes to some extent, the overall integrity of the visualizations such as clustering and separation remain intact. The fact that the cluster borders remain clear and crisp in all nine matrix panes indicates a very positive result of our approach. (We will revisit the fidelity issue in Section 7.)  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Computation Performance</head><p>Perhaps a more important goal of the stratification effort is to substantially reduce the computation time of the MDS process. While all our numerical programs are implemented locally using C++ on a SUN Ultra 10, we choose to use a commercial package-Mathematica 4.2 <ref type="bibr">[Mathematica 2003</ref>] running on a Macintosh G4 with 1 GB memory-to report the computation performances. The Eigenvalue function used in Mathematica is algorithmically compatible to those championed by Netlib <ref type="bibr">[2003]</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows the benchmark results of our study. The top row (in blue) shows the number of dimensions in the document vectors. The left column (in green) shows the number of document vectors included in the computation. The other nine cells are computation time measured in wall clock seconds. The corresponding scatterplot of each cell is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref>. The results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> show a 92.5% time reduction (from 34.9s to 2.62s) when we compress the vectors from 200 to 50 dimensions. The table further demonstrates a notable 97.5% time reduction (from 34.9s to 0.89s) if we simultaneously reduce the number of vectors from 3,298 to 824 in the computation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Sammon Projection</head><p>So far we have focused only on the classical MDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Cox and Cox 1994]</ref> in our investigation. To show the flexibility of our adaptive visualization technique, we demonstrate a second scaling example using a least-square MDS technique known as Sammon Projection <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[Sammon 1969]</ref>.</p><p>Classical MDS treats similarity between two vectors directly as Euclidean distances whereas least-square MDS takes it as the least squares of a continuous monotonic function. A particular strength of a Sammon Projection over a classical MDS projection in visualization is that the former usually has fewer overlapping clusters due largely to its non-linear mapping approach. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref> shows a re-execution of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref> using the Sammon Projection technique. Although the visualization results look very different from those in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref>, the impact on the stratification and their results are very much like those in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref>. Most of the scatter points are able to maintain their original positions and orientations. The four point colors (red, green, blue, and orange), which are assigned after a K-mean clustering process, clearly show the integrity of the visualization after substantial dimension and vector reductions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Remote Sensing Imagery</head><p>Our adaptive visualization technique can also be used to visualize image streams such as hyperspectral remote sensing imagery. A major motivation to include all spectral bands in the image analysis is that subjects that appear identical in one spectral band (like visible color) may be very different from each other if we look into all possible spectral bands of the images. The goal of this example is to show that we can apply the same stratification approaches to analyze imagery streams.</p><p>Our next example uses the hyperspectral image set discussed in Section 3.2. We first apply classical MDS to scaling the pixel vectors followed by a K-mean process to assign unique colors to eight scatter point clusters. We then stratify the vectors progressively and generate the MDS visualization after each reduction. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 9</ref> shows the scatterplot matrix with results from different degrees of stratifications.</p><p>In addition to the close proximity among the nine scatterplots as shown in previous examples, this time we can use a different approach to evaluate the accuracy of the results. If we map the colors of individual pixels from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 9</ref> back to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1c</ref>, we obtain the image shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref>. By comparing features in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1c</ref> to those in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref>, we see that all nine scatterplots correctly identify different features of the original image and separate them into different clusters.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">SCATTERPLOT SIMILARITY MATCHING</head><p>So far our discussion on scatterplot comparison has been based on visual means. Visual-based comparisons are fast and convincing. However, they need human attention and interpretation and thus are not practical in some applications. Besides, visual-based pairwise comparison is not always reliable if the scatterplots do not reflect any visible patterns. For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref> shows two scatterplots filled with white noise. As we will reveal later, these two scatterplots are very similar. But our eyes are fooled by the lack of visible patterns that are required to register the images.</p><p>We want to find a reliable computation method to evaluate the similarity between two scatterplots so that we have a metric to measure the fidelity of our approximations generated by stratification and later our fusion technique. In statistics studies, the class of techniques of matching two similar n-D configurations and producing a measure of the match is commonly known as Procrustes analysis <ref type="bibr">[Cox and Cox 1997]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Procrustes Analysis</head><p>We implemented a Procrustes program that can match scatterplots in any number of dimensions. We also assume that the one-to-one correspondence information among the scatter points is known. While the theory behind the analysis is beyond the scope of this paper, we can comfortably summarize our implementation in four basic steps. Given two 2-D scatterplots X and Y where X and Y are (n 2) matrices, the steps to match X to Y and report a measure of the match are:</p><p>1. Translate the two scatterplots so that they both have their centroids at the origin-by subtracting each point with its mean coordinates of the scatterplot. 2. Rotate X to match Y by multiplying X with (X T YY T X) ½ (Y T X) -1 . 3. Dilate scatter points in X by multiplying each of them with tr(X T YY T X) ½ /tr(X T X) T . 4. The matching index between X and Y = 1 -{tr(X T YY T X) ½ } 2 /{tr(X T X)tr(Y T Y)}. The goal is to seek the isotropic dilation and the rigid translation, reflection, and rotation required to match one scatterplot with the other. The matching index calculated in Step 4 ranges from zero (best) to one (worst).</p><p>For example, we can match the scatterplot in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11b</ref> to the one in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11a</ref> by a rotation of -36 degree (Step 2) followed by a scaling of 2 (Step 3). The matching index (Step 4) of this Procrustes analysis is 2.21008 10 -30 -which indicates the two scatterplots are nearly identical. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the results of Procrustes analyses that were carried out on the corpus scatterplots in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref>. The very low index values (from 0.016 to 0.14) in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> indicate that all eight scatterplots generated by stratified vectors are extremely similar to the full resolution one using all 3,268 vectors with all 200 dimensions. These highly accurate results and the notable 97.5% time reduction in generating one of them (reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>) are strong evidence that the two demonstrated stratification approaches are viable solutions in visualizing transient data streams. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Matching indices between the eight document corpus scatterplots and the original full resolution one shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref>. To further support our argument, we provide the matching results of the remote sensing imagery scatterplots shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure  9</ref> in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. The matching indices listed in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> are even lower than those listed in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Even the worst case (1/4 dimension, 1/4 vectors) accomplishes an identical matching index up to four significant figures. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Matching indices between the eight remote sensing imagery scatterplots and the full resolution one shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref>.   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">INCREMENTAL VISUALIZATION USING FUSION</head><p>Our first visualization technique focuses primarily on the use of stratified vectors, which substitute the full-resolution ones to generate fast and accurate MDS scatterplots. The stratification effort alone, however, does not eliminate the requirement to reprocess the entire dataset whenever new items arrive. Our next visualization technique, which is developed based on a data-fusion concept, addresses the re-processing issue by projecting new items directly onto an existing visualization without frequently reprocessing the entire dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">Robust Eigenvectors</head><p>In Section 5.2, we observed that the visualization subspaces spanned by the two dominant Eigenvectors of our demo datasets are extremely resilient for changes. All the follow-on examples shown in Figures 6 to 9 indicate only minor distortions even after a substantial amount of the input data is removed. To further explore this characteristic, we use the hyperspectral imagery (see Section 3.2 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1c)</ref> to study the similarity between the Eigenvectors (and the corresponding scatterplots) generated from local regions versus the entire dataset. To provide identities to individual pixels, we use the image representation shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref> to represent the hyperspectral imagery instead of the one in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1c</ref> throughout this discussion.</p><p>Our first step is to generate a MDS scatterplot <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 12a</ref>) using the pixel vectors from the entire hyperspectral imagery. We then select and crop three smaller regions and generate three MDS plots <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figures 12b to 12d</ref>) using only the pixel vectors from the corresponding regions. These local regions are selected because they contain diverse image features (i.e., purple, pink, and blue on left; yellow, green, and red on right; and a mixture of everything in the middle) as reflected by the pixel colors.</p><p>Our next step is to generate three more scatterplots ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures  12e to 12g</ref>) using the corresponding pixel vectors found in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures  12b to 12d</ref>. This time we use the Eigenvectors computed from the entire hyperspectral imagery (instead of the local cropped windows) to construct all three scatterplots. This can be done by reusing the coordinates of the selected scatterpoints from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  12a</ref>, which is constructed using Eigenvectors from the entire imagery. In other words, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 12b and 12e</ref> are generated using same pixel vectors, as are <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 12c and 12f</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 12d and  12g</ref>. However, Figures 12b to 12d use local Eigenvectors of the cropped regions whereas the ones in Figures 12e to 12g use global Eigenvectors of the entire imagery.</p><p>The resultant scatterplots in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 12b to 12g</ref> show that the three corresponding pairs (i.e., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 12b and 12e, Figures 12c  and 12f, and Figures 12d and 12g)</ref> closely resemble each other. This visual-based conclusion is consistent with the near zero Procrustes matching indices shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 4</ref>, which imply a close similarity among the pairs. Because the first Eigenvector is the line though the centroid of the scatter points along which the variance of the projections is greatest (not necessarily the direction of the greatest ranges or extent of the data) and the second Eigenvector is orthogonal to the first one, these Eigenvectors tend to be very robust for changes unless a substantial amount of disparate information is added. This remarkable property becomes the foundation of our next visualization technique on data streams. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref> illustrates an overview of our incremental visualization technique using multiple sliding windows. After the Eigenvectors of a long (blue) window are determined and a 2-D scatterplot is generated, newly arrived individual vectors from the short (red) window are projected directly onto the visualization subspace by <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref>: Scatterplot a) (top right) is generated from the demo imagery (top left). Scatterplots b) to d) (bottom left) are generated from the corresponding cropped areas. Scatterplots e) to g) are generated by extracting the scatter points from a) that are found in the corresponding cropping windows which generate scatterplots b) to d). areas only a simply computing the dot-products between the incoming data vectors with the Eigenvectors of the long window. So instead of repeatedly processing the rather expensive (O(n 3 )) classical MDS function or even the faster (O(n n)) version <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[Morrison et al. 2002]</ref> whenever new information arrives, one can now obtain an almost instant visualization update by carrying out a simple (O(m), m = vector dimension, m &lt;&lt; n) dot-product operation to determine the point location of the new information in the scatterplot.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2">Multiple Sliding Windows</head><p>We use the same hyperspectral imagery to demonstrate the concept of our visualization technique. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 14a</ref> shows an ideal case when 100% of the pixel vectors are used to generate the scatterplot by MDS. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 14b</ref>, only 75% of the pixel vectors are projected onto the scatterplot by MDS. The other 25% are projected by a dot-product function using the Eigenvectors of the first 75%. Finally, only 50% of the pixel vectors are projected by MDS. The other 50% are projected according to the Eigenvectors of the first 50%.</p><p>While the scatterplots in Figures 14b to 14c look similar to the full resolution one in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 14a</ref>, the low Procrustes indices in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 5</ref> confirm that the three scatterplots are indeed close to each other. These near-zero matching indices also validate our argument that we can obtain a fast and accurate overview of the entire dataset without the requirement of re-processing the entire dataset.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">COMBINED VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUE</head><p>Although the two visualization techniques presented in this paper are intended to operate independently, we can combine them together and get the best of both worlds. The newly combined technique is capable of processing both individual items one at a time (by data fusion) and large amounts of items all together (by data stratification) efficiently and effectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.1">Error-Tracking Optimization</head><p>We have used Procrustes analysis as the primary computational method to evaluate the errors between a full-resolution standard scatterplot (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 14a</ref>) and ones based on multiple sliding windows approach <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figures 14b and 14c.</ref>) A noticeable enhancement to speed up the error-tracking process (and thus the visualization process) is to replace the full-resolution standard scatterplot with a fast and accurate substitute like the one using stratified vectors as presented in Section 5.1. The results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> show that we can save up to 92% of computation time (from 34.9s to 2.62s) if we compress the dimensions of 3,268 vectors by 75%. And the results in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> show that a 75% reduced data matrix (dimension reduced from 169 to 42) can still be as accurate as the full resolution one. Because of this faster error checking process, we can now afford to carry out error estimation more frequently and thus improve the overall quality of the analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.2">Dynamic Visualization Steps</head><p>Although the pre-processing steps of different data streams may vary, we can summarize the operations of the combined visualization technique in six major steps as follows:</p><p>1. When influx rate &lt; processing rate, use MDS to reprocess the entire dataset when new information arrives. 2. When influx rate &gt; processing rate, halt the MDS process. 3. Use the multiple sliding windows approach to update the existing scatterplot with the new information. Repeat</p><p>Step 3 for a pre-defined number of updates. 4. Use the stratification approach to come up with a fast overview of the entire dataset. 5. Use the stratified overview to evaluate the accumulated error generated by the multiple sliding windows method using Procrustes analysis. 6. If error threshold is reached, go to Step 1. Otherwise, go to Step 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>The general concept of scaling has been applied extensively to visualize the similarities of high-dimensional information for many years. In the case of corpus visualization, the combination of representing individual documents as mathematical vectors and projecting them onto a low-dimensional space using certain scaling techniques has becomes the de facto approach for many corpora visualization packages. Unfortunately, these packages are designed to analyze static corpora only and thus cannot handle dynamic text streams proficiently. The work presented in this paper provides critical technology to tackle such a clear and present problem. Decades of MDS research and development by biologists, psychologists, statisticians, and now computational scientists have successfully reduced the time complexity of MDS from O(n 3 ) at the beginning, to O(n 2 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Chalmers 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">] in 1996</ref><ref type="bibr">, and to O(n n) [Morrison 2002</ref> in 2002. However, these significant results still require the reprocessing of at least a portion of the dataset for every update. When an individual item arrives, it is far better to use our data fusion method, which takes only O(m) (m = vector dimension, m &lt;&lt; n) time to obtain an instant scatterplot update.</p><p>While our dynamic visualization approach appears to work well on text and image streams, we have not included other data streams in our study. Until we conduct a full investigation, we cannot claim our approach is not without limitations.</p><p>We are in the process of integrating part of our work into an ongoing system development effort focusing on text stream visualization. We plan to evaluate the performance in a real-life environment using live text streams and present the results in the near future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have presented two dynamic visualization techniques to analyze transient data streams. Using a newswire corpus and a remote sensing imagery sequence, we demonstrate that our data stratification approach can substantially speed up the visualization process and yet maintain the high fidelity of the graphic results. We also show that our data fusion approach can provide instant updates of an MDS scatterplot without the requirement of reprocessing all the information in full resolution. All our approximation results have been validated by both visual and computational tests based on Procrustes analysis. We believe the concepts of data stratification and data fusion will play an important role in many future data stream analysis tool designs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 2: A document scatterplot generated by MDS.</figDesc></figure>
