			<abstract>
				<p>We introduce an approach to visual analysis of multivariate data that integrates several methods from information visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and geovisualization. The approach leverages the component-based architecture implemented in GeoVISTA Studio to construct a flexible, multiview, tightly (but generically) coordinated, EDA toolkit. This toolkit builds upon traditional ideas behind both small multiples and scatterplot matrices in three fundamental ways. First, we develop a general, MultiForm, Bivariate Matrix and a complementary MultiForm, Bivariate Small Multiple plot in which different bivariate representation forms can be used in combination. We demonstrate the flexibility of this approach with matrices and small multiples that depict multivariate data through combinations of: scatterplots, bivariate maps, and space-filling displays. Second, we apply a measure of conditional entropy to (a) identify variables from a high-dimensional data set that are likely to display interesting relationships and (b) generate a default order of these variables in the matrix or small multiple display. Third, we add conditioning, a kind of dynamic query/filtering in which supplementary (undisplayed) variables are used to constrain the view onto variables that are displayed. Conditioning allows the effects of one or more well understood variables to be removed from the analysis, making relationships among remaining variables easier to explore. We illustrate the individual and combined functionality enabled by this approach through application to analysis of cancer diagnosis and mortality data and their associated covariates and risk factors.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Data often become information when methods and tools enable multivariate relationships to be uncovered. Identifying and understanding complex, multivariate relationships requires examination of those relationships from multiple perspectives. Here, we pre-sent an approach to multivariate data analysis that extends from and integrates several well-known visual display and analysis methods used in information visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and geovisualization. A suite of methods are incorporated into a pair of dynamic, computationally-assisted, visual analysis tools. These tools emphasize juxtaposition and sorting of multiple, bivariate representations that: (a) use interactive statistical analysis of bivariate association to generate default ordering in the display and to select data subspaces with variables of potential interest and (b) can be "conditioned" by filtering on non-displayed variables.</p><p>Our work builds on concepts and methods from several perspectives on visual information analysis; key aspects of this past work are highlighted in section 2. Section 3 provides a brief overview of GeoVISTA Studio, our application-building environment that supports flexible, component-based application design and implementation. Then, we introduce a suite of MultiForm, multivariate, visual data analysis tools, outline a method for selecting and ordering variables based on conditional entropy, and discuss addition of data conditioning (section 4). Throughout Section 4 we demonstrate the use of the methods and tools through application to georeferenced cancer and risk factor data. Section 5 provides conclusions and plans for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>The work reported here is informed by past research on five general categories of multivariate information analysis methods: information sorting (permutation matrices and correlation ordering), small multiples (with emphasis on user manipulation), bivariate dynamically linked matrices (brushable scatterplot matrices and their extensions), space-filling visualizations (tree-maps, mosaic plots, and pixel-oriented displays), and dynamic scope control (including dynamic query and conditioning).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Sorting</head><p>Sorting is a fundamental information organization and analysis method incorporated in database, spreadsheet, and related software. The ability to sort a table or spreadsheet on selected attributes allows a user to understand relationships between one variable and many or (with nested sorting) among multiple variables. The power of visually-facilitated sorting as a method to uncover multivariate relationships has been explored by several authors. Many ground their work in Bertin's concept of a permutation matrix, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gluck et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Siirtola, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Wilkinson, 1979)</ref>. A permutation matrix is essentially a graphical table for which: (a) cell values are replaced by a graphic depiction of the value and (b) rows and columns can be sorted by an agent (human, computational, or both) to search for groupings of related entities.</p><p>Several authors have applied automated sorting routines to derive a useful matrix depiction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Schmid and Hinterberger (1994)</ref> advocate completely automated sorting to reduce user bias. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mäkinen and Siirtola (2000)</ref>, in contrast, demonstrate that at least some sub-problems underlying the permutation matrix approach are NP-complete. As a result, they advocate user controllable, computationally-assisted sorting. Their "reorderable matrix." directly implements Bertin's concept of a matrix with attributes (depicted by the graphic variable size) along the x-axis and objects along the y-axis, while balancing the task of sorting for interesting patterns between the system and the user. In complementary work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gluck (2001)</ref> has extended the basic idea, under the label of augmented seriation. His extensions include dynamic linking with small multiples of univariate and bivariate maps and application of redundant graphic variables (size, color saturation), as well as sonic variables (pitch, loudness), to enhance pattern identification and hypothesis generation.</p><p>In contrast to the permutation matrix/seriation method (which is applied to univariate entries in a table), <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Friendly, 2002b)</ref> proposes the concept of correlation ordering, which is applied to bivariate relationships in correlation matrices. The goal is to put "similar" variables (in terms of correlations) together in the matrix to enhance detection of trends and anomalies. Ankerst et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ankerst et al., 1998)</ref> have proposed a related computational approach to sorting that uses a heuristic method to cluster similar dimensions. Below, we present an alternative approach for sorting variables based on conditional entropy as the measure of bivariate association and minimum spanning trees as the sorting method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Small multiples</head><p>A second information visualization method that underlies the work presented here is the small multiple -a set of juxtaposed data representations that together support understanding of multivariate information. Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Tufte (1983)</ref> popularized this method (and is often credited with the term), the idea was introduced as a data analysis technique by <ref type="bibr">Bertin in 1967 (called simply collections)</ref>; and presented in English editions of his books in the early 1980s <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bertin, 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bertin, , 1983</ref>.</p><p>A key difference between Bertin's concept and that labeled small multiples by Tufte is that Bertin emphasized the potential for insight about patterns and relationships that can be gained by providing users with the ability to sort the collections of related views (thus to reorder the small multiples). We have previously considered the potential of interactive "extensions" to the small multiple method in the context of geovisualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(DiBiase et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">MacEachren, 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">MacEachren, , 2001</ref>). More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pinnel (2000)</ref> implemented a version of manipulable, map-based small multiples that includes both temporal map representations and difference maps to show change at each time point (in relation to a base time). The method has also been applied recently, by <ref type="bibr">Iizuka and colleagues (1998)</ref>, to visual comparison of tabular data using graphic table displays that are similar in appearance to permutation matrices. In this work, they apply computational methods to sort the tables into a similarity-based small-multiple arrangement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Linked bivariate matrices</head><p>A third core visual analysis method on which our work builds is the scatterplot matrix, a method with roots in statistical EDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chambers et al., 1983)</ref>. While small multiples have most often been used for display and analysis of multiple, univariate representations, the scatterplot matrix by design focuses on multiple, bivariate relationships. Many extensions have been made to the basic method over the years, see: <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Becker &amp; Cleveland, 1987)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Reed et al., 1995)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Rousseeuw et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Zani et al., 1998)</ref>. Several authors have used dynamic linking to combine the scatterplot matrix with other display forms such as maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Carr et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cook et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Monmonier, 1989)</ref> and alternative multi-variate depictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Schmid &amp; Hinterberger, 1994)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Friendly (1999)</ref>, in work particularly relevant to our own, adapted the basic matrix form to produce both a conditional scatterplot matrix and a bivariate mosaic plot matrix. In the conditional scatterplot matrix, each panel depicts the partial correlation between row and column variable, given the remaining variables. The mosaic matrix is the categorical data analog of a scatterplot matrix, showing selected aspects of the bivariate relation between all pairs of variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Space-filling visualization</head><p>A mosaic plot (used for each panel in a mosaic matrix) is one of several forms of space-filling visualization developed to represent categorical data. The term space-filling seems to have been coined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Johnson and Shneiderman (1991)</ref> in a paper "introducing" tree maps. However, the basic idea of space-filling visualization can be traced to the early origins of information graphics in late 17 th century Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Friendly, 2002a</ref>) and a close precursor to modern tree maps was proposed in 1934 by the cartographer Raisz, as an abstract form of cartogram <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Raisz, 1934)</ref>. There are a number of other possible variants on the space-filling idea, each of which imposes different constraints on the display. <ref type="bibr">Stasko and colleagues (2000)</ref>, for example, consider their sunburst method to be space-filling, but relax the constraint that the space is rectangular. They cite empirical evidence that their concentric representation of nested classification has user performance advantages over a tree map representation.</p><p>We consider the pixel-oriented methods developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Keim (Keim &amp; Kriegel, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Keim, 2000)</ref> to be part of the family of space-filling visualizations, since these methods also fill the entire space by subdividing it. The primary differences between pixeloriented methods and tree-maps or mosaic plots are that the pixeloriented methods constrain all entities to representation by equal size (generally square) rectangles, with order of the rectangles in the space and color attributes assigned to them used to communicate categories or quantities. In addition, pixel-oriented methods were developed for depicting very large data sets and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Keim and Kriegel (1996)</ref> proposed that they can be effective when using only one pixel per data value. Below, we introduce a hybrid space-filling visualization that draws most heavily on the pixeloriented method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Dynamic scope control</head><p>Dynamic scope control can be a powerful complement to the multivariate visual display and analysis methods reviewed above. Scope control, as defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Goldstein and Roth (1994)</ref>, is any user-initiated operation that constrains the data entities displayed to those meeting specified parameters on one or more variables (displayed or not). Dynamic query is a common form of scope control used in information visualization. It involves rapid adjustment of multiple query parameters, often through user adjustable sliders <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ahlberg et al., 1992)</ref>. The method is applied in a wide range of visualization tools for an equally wide range of applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ahlberg &amp; Shneiderman, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Goldstein &amp; Roth, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kumar et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tweedie, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Conditioning is a variant on dynamic query in which the view on the displayed data is constrained by controlling the scope of one or more secondary variables that are not displayed <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carr et al., 2000)</ref>. Conditioning is applied when the goal is to control (or condition) for the effects of one variable while exploring others. For example, to explore risk factors for lung cancer, we might condition the display on data for smoking (a known risk factor) while we explore potential (but less well understood) risk factors.</p><p>The method is derived from the prosection technique first introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Furnas and Buja (1994)</ref> and has been successfully applied to bivariate matrix displays <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brunsdon, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Tweedie et al., 1996)</ref> and to map-based displays <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brunsdon, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Carr et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Carr et al., submitted)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">GeoVISTA Studio</head><p>A primary contribution of the work presented here is to develop and implement methods that enable integration of ideas from the diverse set of InfoVis/EDA/geovisualization developments discussed above. We do this by leveraging GeoVISTA Studio, an open source visual programming environment for building Java applications and applets from JavaBeans <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>). The Studio engine provides a generic environment to support construction of applications in any domain. Components available with the current Studio distribution (http://sourceforge.net/) include ones for visualization, computational analysis (e.g., high-dimensional clustering, inductive learning, K-means classification) and statistical analysis (e.g., outlier detection, local spatial autocorrelation). Our focus in this paper is on integration of a suite of visualization components that we have specifically implemented and that support multiple kinds of coordinated behavior applied to multivariate data exploration. For more complete discussion of the Studio environment, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gahegan et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">MacEachren et al., 2003)</ref> Studio uses Java's introspection capabilities to discover each component's available methods, allowing application designers to combine components that were not originally developed to work together. This mechanism, allowed us to add an attribute animator that supports an animated grand tour (by variable and subcategory -see accompanying video). This was accomplished in about one hour, even though none of the components had been specifically designed to support animation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> illustrates a typical Studio design (for an applications discussed below).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Multiform representions</head><p>The focus of the work presented here is on integrating methods and tools for exploratory analysis of multivariate data. Specifically, the work emphasizes juxtaposition, ordering, manipulation, and linking of multiple bivariate views. We begin by defining three classes of display types, and their subclasses. representation forms (e.g., maps + scatterplots, bagplots).</p><p>Our focus here is on the MultiForm Bivariate displays (2b and 3b). Implementation of each is described and illustrated below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">MultiForm Bivariate Small Multiple</head><p>The MultiForm Bivariate Small Multiple display (henceforth shortened to MultiForm Small Multiple or Small Multiple) supports analysis of multiple (potentially) related bivariate relationships through the perspectives of different bivariate representation forms. In the version currently implemented, each row uses a different representation form to display bivariate representations that relate a single common variable (assigned to rows) with any number of additional variables (one per column). Our Small Multiple is designed as a generic JavaBean component. The component provides a Java interface through which any bivariate representation form (instantiated as a JavaBean) can communicate <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> provides the simplest case, with two representation forms and two columns showing data for 156 counties making up the Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky portion of the Appalachia Cancer Network. The common variable is per capita income and the columns contain small multiples depicting ageadjusted, cervical and breast cancer mortality. Coloring of dots on the scatterplot provides a legend through which the bivariate maps can be interpreted (the bivariate legend in map panel two is part of another component in the working system and has been superimposed here, along with the labels in the bottom panels to make the  print figure understandable). The color scheme applied uses sequential value (lightness) ranges for complementary hues to depict each variable, resulting in a range from light to dark grey along the diagonal (light grey = low-low, medium grey = medium-medium, and dark grey = high-high). The hue combinations used are ones developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brewer (1994)</ref> to be both logical and robust (e.g., they work for people with color vision deficiencies).</p><p>One interesting pattern is evident in Pennsylvania, where the bright green counties for cervical cancer mortality in the left map panel indicate relatively high income but low cancer rates while the dark grey counties in the right map panel indicate high breast cancer corresponding to high income. A hypothesis to explain the difference is that, low income women do not receive the same level of health care and this increases the chance for cervical cancer (since it is a cancer that can be prevented if early signs are detected). However, for breast cancer, the relationship is somewhat reversed because having children late in life is a risk factor and higher income women tend to delay having children.</p><p>Exploration is supported in the Small Multiples by allowing users to manually sort columns to juxtapose variable pairs of interest or to sort the entire set based on some ordered characteristic. This ability to sort by column (or row) is similar to functionality in other interactive small multiple implementations. The differences here are that: (a) the juxtaposition of different representation forms allows users to integrate perspectives (e.g., the relationship between geographic clusters and clusters in attribute space) and (b) we have implemented computational detection of interesting variable subsets along with sorting of the subsets to generate potentially meaningful default orders (see section 4.3 below).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Multiform Bivariate Matrix</head><p>As with a standard scatterplot matrix, the Multiform Bivariate Matrix (referred to henceforth as the MultiForm Matrix or simply the Matrix) allows users to select interesting variables to be displayed in juxtaposed, elemental, bivariate representations (with variables depicted in each representation defined by row-column position). Our Matrix is designed as a generic JavaBean component. As above, the Matrix is implemented as a JavaBean with a Java interface for communicating with any bivariate component. Representation forms that work with the matrix thus far include scatterplots, bivariate maps, and the spacefill display. We are in the process of adding treemaps (with size and color fill controlled by column and row variables), bagplots (bivariate boxplots), and mosaic plots as additional bivariate forms. The same or different representation forms can appear above and below the diagonal (with scatterplots in both places, the result is a standard scatterplot matrix). The central diagonal accepts any univariate representation form (also as a JavaBean).</p><p>Any number of variables can be selected for display within the Matrix; selecting five variables would produce a set of 20 bivariate displays. The selection of variables can be achieved via a pulldown menu, as well as through coordinated events generated by other components (as discussed in section 4.3). As with the Small Multiple plot, sorting of representations is supported in the Matrix (both through direct user manipulation or other system eventsagain, details of our computational sorting methods are discussed in section 4.3). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows a Matrix containing scatterplots paired with maps; here, histograms are used for each individual variable along the diagonal. This Matrix is part of a typical application that includes a dynamically linked univariate map and conditioning controls (described in section 4.5). In each Matrix panel, users can access a detailed version of the representation form with additional controls on functionality. Changes made in the detailed view (e.g., constraining the data range depicted for a variable in a scatterplot) are propagated to other cells for which the change is relevant.</p><p>Our Matrix implementation (and the Small Multiple plot) provides flexible support for coordinating user and data events across components by a separate coordinator component. This component extends the traditional idea of linked brushing considerably. In addition to standard brushing (including AND and OR selection operations), users can selectively establish dynamic connections among components for the following events: Background Color, Classification, Color Array, Color Classifier, Conditioning, Data Set, Indication, Selection, Spatial Extent, Subspace.</p><p>The Matrix and linked bivariate map in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">figure 4</ref> shows the relationship between four variables for counties in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky that are part of the Appalachia Cancer Network (in the Matrix: age-adjusted breast cancer mortality rate/100,000, percent of cancer diagnoses at local stage in the body, and percent of women age 54-65 who have had mammograms in the past 2 years; in the univariate map: number of screening mammography facilities/1000 population). In general, an increase in cancer screening leads to more early detection (thus a positive relationship with percent local stage diagnosis -the lower right scatterplot). There is, however, a group of counties with a high percent of women having had a recent mammogram but with low percent early detection. Using the tools capability to do multiple additive selections, these counties have been selected in the scatterplot and highlighted in all scatterplots and maps. The linked univariate map of screening facility accessibility shows that this pattern occurs mostly in counties where accessibility to screening is low. A possible explanation for the observed pattern is that, although women in these counties have been screened recently, lack of screening facilities may have limited their past screening, leading to detection of cancer at later stages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Selecting and sorting variables</head><p>As discussed above, sorting is a fundamental tool of information visualization. The tools described here include components that support: (a) automatic or interactive selection of potentially interesting subspaces of variables and (b) generation of an initial viewing order for variables in the display components. While we pre- In contrast to Friendly (2002b), we display bivariate correlation (for reference) but sort on conditional entropy. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref> shows a matrix in which correlation (independent of sign) is displayed above the diagonal and conditional entropy is displayed below (in both cases, the bright cells, thus white, represent strong relationships). Variables are ordered on their paired entropy. Given an entropy threshold, interesting subspaces can be automatically identified. The user can also pick variables to form a subspace based on her domain knowledge and interest.</p><p>The dimension selection tool ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5)</ref> shows a subset from a larger set of 60 variables (several cancers and a wide range of risk factors). The tool is used to select clusters of variables from the active subset, here from a subset that includes breast and/or cervical cancer mortality rates, success in early diagnosis, and several variables indicating access to (and ability to afford) screening for cancer and subsequent treatment. Highlighted in the matrix shown is a cluster of three variables that have strong bivariate relationships (based on entropy). This cluster contains percent of ageadjusted, breast cancer diagnoses made at local (early) disease stage (%AABrLocal) along with the related risk factors of doctors/100,000 (MDratio) and per capita income. These selected variables are broadcast to other components, along with a default initial ordering for display calculated, as discussed in section 4.3.2 (see <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> for the result in one component). Below, we discuss (briefly) the calculation of conditional entropy (and its advantages over other measures, e.g., correlation) as a measure of relationship in an exploratory environment and the generation of a reasonable sorting of variables overall and variables in selected subspaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">How to calculate maximum conditional entropy</head><p>Let S 2 be a 2D subspace comprised of dimensions X and Y. To calculate the maximum conditional entropy of S 2 , both X and Y must be discretitized into ξ intervals, which partition S 2 into a matrix of grid cells. The discretization of each dimension is a critical step, which can dramatically influence the final measure. We use a nested-means approach instead of the traditional equalinterval approach to partition each dimension. After the discretization of X and Y, let χ be the set of grid cells (including empty ones) for a column X i (i = 1..ξ) in the matrix, and d(x) be the density of a cell x∈χ, i.e., the number of points in x divided by the total number of points in X i . Then the entropy of this column X i is  calculated using the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H(X i ) = -∑ x∈χ [d(x) logd(x)] / log|χ|.</formula><p>Conditional entropy (Y|X) is a weighted sum of H(X i ), i = 1..ξ. Conditional entropy (X|Y) can be calculated similarly using rows, Y j (j = 1..ξ), instead of columns. Then the larger value of these two conditional entropies, maximum conditional entropy, is taken as the final entropy value for subspace S 2 . The most prominent advantage of this conditional-entropy-based measure is that it can capture the existence of more complex patterns (clusters) than either the linear (or logarithmic, or exponential) relationships that correlation can detect or the sequential patterns measured by similarity functions presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ankerst et al., 1998)</ref>. A detailed introduction and evaluation of this part of work can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Guo et al., 2003)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">How to generate an ordering of dimensions</head><p>Let S = a 1 × a 2 × … × a d be a d-dimensional data space. Let S 2 = {a i × a j | i=1..d, j = 1..d, i &lt; j} be the set of all unique 2D subspaces from S. The conditional entropy values of these 2D subspaces can form a matrix, which is a complete graph with each attribute as a vertex. Between any two attributes there is an "edge", whose length is the conditional entropy value between the attributes. To present a better display of the entropy matrix (and hence a better visualization of a high-dimensional dataset), it is important to decide an ordering of all attributes. Ankerst and colleagues (1998) view such an arrangement of dimensions as a global optimization problem and introduce a heuristic algorithm to solve it. Here we argue that, since irrelevant or noisy attributes are common in high-dimensional data, a global optimal solution may not be the best ordering to detect subspace patterns (which involve only subsets of original dimensions).</p><p>We use a hierarchical clustering approach to generate an ordering of all dimensions so that the more correlated two attributes are (in terms of a low conditional entropy value), the closer they should be in the ordering. The method adopted here first builds a minimum spanning tree (MST) from the graph and then derives an ordering of all attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Guo et al., 2002)</ref>. The ordering preserves all hierarchical clusters and extra proximity information among attributes. The method regards a cluster (connected graph) as a chain of points and each chain has two end points. At the beginning, each cluster (or chain) contains a single point (attribute) and its two end points are the same point. When merging two clusters into one with an edge, the method will connect the closest two ends (each from a distinct chain) in the new chain.</p><p>Visualized in the order derived above, those dimensions of a multidimensional subspace with "good" clusters are likely to neighbor each other. Each cell is colored according to its entropy valueslower entropy values are assigned brighter colors. Striking bright blocks indicate subspaces with good clusters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3">How to select subspaces</head><p>Given a threshold of conditional entropy e, a maximum subspace S max (e) satisfies two conditions: (1) the conditional entropy value of any 2-D subspace from S max (e) is smaller than e; and (2) adding any new dimension that is not in S max (e) will violate the first condition. The rationale for selecting multidimensional subspaces based on this matrix (graph) is: if an L-dimensional (2 &lt; L &lt; d) subspace S L has good clusters, all possible 2-D subspaces of S L should have low conditional entropy values. This rationale is similar to the monotonicity lemma used by CLIQUE: if a collec-tion of points P is a cluster in a k-dimensional space, then P is also part of a cluster in any (k-1)-dimensional projections of this space <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agrawal et al., 1998)</ref>. Based on the conditional entropy matrix, the user can also interactively form a subspace.</p><p>Once a subspace is selected (either interactively formed or automatically identified), the dimensions within this subspace (not all dimensions) will be re-ordered using the approach introduced in the previous section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Grid-based space-filling display</head><p>As noted above, one representation "form" implemented for use in both MultiForm displays (as well as independently) is a spacefilling visualization tool. It is a variant of pixel-oriented techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Keim &amp; Kriegel, 1996)</ref>. As noted above, pixel oriented techniques map data observations onto pixels, using color and arrangement to make patterns visible. Research has shown that these techniques can effectively present a large quantity of information to the user <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Keim, 2000)</ref>. One of the main advantages of this technique is the prevention of over plotting. A scatterplot with thousands of observations will obscure many of them; combining small scatterplots in a matrix exacerbates the problem.</p><p>When used in a Bivariate Small Multiple or Matrix, our spacefill component matches its ordering to the variable defined by the column and its color to the variable defined by the row. The component implements the following space-filling orders: spiral, scan-line, boustrophedon, Peano curves, or Morton ordering.</p><p>Unique aspects of our pixel-oriented display include:</p><p>• ability to function in a small multiple display or a matrix • coordination with other representations</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">• linked exploration • symbol representations</formula><p>First, our grid-based component can be arranged in a matrix, varying the "color by" and "arrange by" variables simultaneously. Pixel-oriented displays have been organized in matrix form previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Keim et al., 2002)</ref>, but not in a bivariate matrix in which the rows and columns provide the variables to depict. Second, our grid-based component can appear in a matrix with an arbitrary number of other components, such as a scatterplot or map, using the same variables that are reflected in the grid-based component. This enables the user to have immediate access to a familiar representation such as a scatterplot, which may be of particular importance to users unfamiliar with grid-based (pixel-oriented) displays. Alternatively, using the map together with the grid-based component, users can rapidly compare geographic patterns with patterns shown in the grid-based display. Third, our grid-based component is linked to many other information visualization and geographic visualization components via our coordinator component. This allows colors, selections, and other user driven display changes to be automatically propagated and shared amongst display elements. Fourth, we have implemented the ability to place other symbols on top of the grid cells of the display (see video). <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows the three variables selected as a related subset using the entropy-based methods discussed above, arranged in the order broadcast by the component. As above, the application domain to which we apply our grid-based spacefill visualization is population data for 156 counties in the Appalachian Cancer Network. With this relatively small number of observations, we have projected the pixel-oriented display into larger spaces (cells occupy multiple pixels). Those counties having a doctor ratio of about 80/1000 or less have been highlighted in a popup scatterplot. The spacefill component makes clear that these counties represent about one half of the total (middle column). The maps illustrate that low doctor ratios are more prevalent in West Virginia and Kentucky than in Pennsylvania, and that Kentucky has large regions with low doctor ratios and low early detection.</p><p>The scatterplot in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> also demonstrates use of Feteke and Plaisant's (1999) excentric labeling method. We downloaded this component from www.lri.fr/~fekete/InfovisToolkit and easily linked with our own components using GeoVISTA Studio and our own coordinator component.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Conditioning</head><p>Our current implementation supports conditioning on any variable or variables. For example, we could condition on percent poor (removing from consideration places with a high percent poor, thus places with the greatest potential cost of health care to be a factor in cancer). This allows attention to be focused on remaining places for which some factor other than financial resources might be responsible for high rates of cancer mortality. When the user selects variables to condition on, the appropriate number of conditioning sliders is generated (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">figure 4)</ref>.</p><p>The conditioning tool gives the user a choice of suppressing data entities that are either outside or inside the range specified. It is also possible to activate a conditioning animator to explore any systematic relationships between the one well known risk factor and others. To do so, the analyst sets an initial conditioning range. The conditioning animator then steps through each data value (adding the next highest and dropping the lowest from the display). This animator component, like the data animator component discussed above, was easily added to our application design (even though components had not been built to support it). Conditioning and the conditioning animator are illustrated in the accompanying video.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions and future work</head><p>This paper presents an integrated perspective on a set of multivariate visual analysis methods that emphasize bivariate relationships as the starting point for discussion. This integrated perspective begins by considering links across a diverse Information Visualization, EDA, and geovisualization literature, then it addresses the integration of related methods in a set of MultiForm, computationally assisted visual tools that enable simultaneous application of multiple perspectives on a data space.</p><p>The methods and tools described are being developed within the context of an interdisciplinary project to achieve integrated visual, statistical, and computational methods for application to interpreting, testing, and validating patterns of cancer incidence and mortality in the United States. Particular attention is directed to significant cancers for which prevention and screening have been shown to be effective. As part of this process, next steps in our research include a user task analysis based on in-depth interviews with potential tool users, a set of focus group assessments of our methods and tools, and subsequent controlled experiments to test selected aspects of those tools, particularly as prompts for problem formulation and hypothesis generation. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.
