				<p>Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) support the heart in its vital task of maintaining circulation in the human body when the heart alone is not able to maintain a sufficient flow rate due to illness or degenerative diseases. However, the engineering of these devices is a highly demanding task. Advanced modeling methods and computer simulations allow the investigation of the fluid flow inside such a device and in particular of potential blood damage. In this paper we present a set of visualization methods which have been designed to specifically support the analysis of a tensor-based blood damage prediction model. This model is based on the tracing of particles through the VAD, for each of which the cumulative blood damage can be computed. The model&apos;s tensor output approximates a single blood cell&apos;s deformation in the flow field. The tensor and derived scalar data are subsequently visualized using techniques based on icons, particle visualization, and function plotting. All these techniques are accessible through a Virtual Realitybased user interface, which features not only stereoscopic rendering but also natural interaction with the complex three-dimensional data. To illustrate the effectiveness of these visualization methods, we present the results of an analysis session that was performed by domain experts for a specific data set for the MicroMed DeBakey VAD.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Heart disease is among the leading causes of death today (35.2% of all deaths in the U.S. in 2005 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>), leaving heart transplants as the only viable long term solution in many cases. However, the number of patients in need of a transplant is significantly higher than the number of available organs. In response, ventricular assist devices (VADs) help to bridge the waiting time by supporting the patient's heart and, in some cases, even facilitate self-recovery. Current devices are not yet suitable as long term solution to replace heart transplantation which is one of the driving goals in development of next generation VADs.</p><p>When designing a VAD, two crucial aspects have to be addressed. First, the hydraulic requirements need to be fulfilled, i.e., the blood needs to be transported at the desired flow rate. Second, hematological requirements need to be taken care of. In particular, this includes avoiding damage to the red blood cells (RBCs), which release hemoglobin into the blood stream when exposed to elevated stresses in a process known as hemolysis. Hemolysis can lead to intoxication and even organ failure, if the level of plasma free hemoglobin exceeds a critical threshold.</p><p>Major drawbacks of experimental evaluation of VADs include the fact, that hemolysis can only be predicted on a before/after basis for the entire device. No information is available about the locations inside the device where hemolysis takes place. In contrast, numerically modeling blood damage is not only much more convenient but has the additional advantage that cause-effect relationships between the flow field and the blood damage may be established, thus potentially suggesting suitable optimization areas in pump design.</p><p>The blood damage model underlying this work is based on an analogy between RBCs traveling through the device and droplets. The path of a batch of RBCs is modeled by standard pathlines, i.e. it is assumed that RBCs are small enough to be regarded as massless particles in the flow. The deformation which results from the external forces imposed on the RBCs is approximated along their paths. This deformation is described by the morphology tensor, which in turn is the basis for hemolysis prediction. The blood damage assessment results in a multi-dimensional attribute set which is available at each trace point and forms the input for the visualization. In order to be able to efficiently analyze this information, the domain scientists stated the following requirements: First, the temporal evolution of the RBCs' deformation should be visualized. Second, one should be able to quickly identify regions with a high risk of blood damage. Finally, it should be possible to analyze correlations between blood damage and flow field characteristics in these regions.</p><p>In this paper we present a set of visualization methods that have been designed to meet these requirements. The first technique follows an icon-based approach and depicts the continuous evolution of an RBC's deformation along a pathline as well as a static overview thereof. The second technique uses a set of marker particles to indicate regions with a high rate of hemolysis. A quantitative overview over large particle populations is facilitated by a function plot technique for blood damage related scalar values. Additionally, we include an interaction metaphor which specifically targets the temporal navigation in transient data sets with thousands of time steps. All methods are implemented in a prototype application which can be run in interactive virtual environments. The use of VR technology in this particular setting alleviates standard problems of 2D projections such as occlusion, cluttering, and awkward interaction with 3D data.</p><p>We illustrate the usefulness of the devised techniques by presenting a case study carried out by domain experts. In this study we use a specific VAD, the MicroMed DeBakey blood pump. This axial pump consists of the flow straightener, a six-bladed impeller, and a six-bladed diffuser inside a cylindrical housing, as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>In summary, the contributions of this paper are twofold: First, we present a set of visualization techniques which have been specifically designed for the analysis of a tensor-based blood damage model. These include the static and animated iconic views for blood damage visualization and the use of tracer particles outlined in Section 4. Second, we describe the results of an analysis session conducted by domain experts using these techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>The blood damage model underlying this work is based on the tracing of pathlines, i.e., particle traces for transient flow data. Particle tracing is one of the standard visualization approaches for vector fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. For transient flows this is still a challenging task, even for moderately sized data sets.

Sobel et al. use a line-based technique they call particle flurries <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</p><p>The key information in the blood damage model, with which we extract the hemolysis prediction, is the morphology tensor. It models the morphological deformation affecting blood cells along a pathline. Mechanical quantities such as stress and strain inducing deformations of an object are common, e.g., in geomechanics <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Another application area of tensor field visualization is nematic liquid crystal alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Moreover, analogies to the physical effect described by the underlying tensor field can be used for visualization, e.g., in the cases of volume deformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> or distortion textures <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>In flow field visualization, abstract iconic representations have been used to depict tensor valued flow attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref>.

The morphology tensor generated in this work is related to stress and strain. However, the deformation it describes does not only depend on these two parameters, but also accounts for the natural protection mechanism of the cell in a shearing flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. We use an icon-based approach for the visualization of this information, as well.</p><p>Virtual Reality (VR) technology has been successfully employed for scientific visualization for almost two decades now.

Schirski et al. presented the ViSTA FlowLib framework for the immersive visualization of transient flow fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.

The prototype implementations of both Kuester et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and Sobel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> include a VR-based user interface.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">BLOOD DAMAGE PREDICTION</head><p>Because of its crucial importance for this work, we summarize the underlying blood damage model in this section. A detailed discussion including a description of the modeling of blood flow can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">A Strain-based Hemolysis Model</head><p>Based on steady simple-shear flow experiments which measured hemolysis in a Couette viscometer, Giersiepen et al. proposed a correlation to quantify blood damage depending on shear stress Ï and exposure time t of the cells to this stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. It relates plasma-free, i.e., not enclosed in RBCs, hemoglobin Hb p f to the total amount of hemoglobin Hb total (measured in g/l blood) and reads Hb p f Hb total = 3.62 â¢ 10 â7 Ï 2.416 t 0.785 .</p><p>In general flow fields where shear stress is no longer scalar one needs to derive a so-called comparative shear stress Ï css that can be plugged into Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Stress-based hemolysis models simply convert the three-dimensional shear stress tensor to a scalar but are known to overpredict hemolysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> because in such a procedure the strain history of a cell is not taken into account. For Newtonian fluids shear stress is proportional to rate of strain, i.e., T = ÂµE where Âµ is fluid viscosity and E the symmetric part of the velocity gradient. A commonly used conversion to a scalar shear stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Ï css = Âµ 1 2 E : E (2)</formula><p>where the colon operator denotes summation over all entries of the component-wise product of the matrices. In contrast to this direct approach, the presented strain-based method derives a comparative shear stress based on the deformation of RBCs in the flow using analogies to droplets exposed to shearing as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>.  The deformation of a single RBC is tracked by solving an evolution equation that was adopted from Maffettone and Minale <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> for a symmetric, positive definite morphology tensor S whose eigenvectors e j represent the half-axes of the droplet. Details on the enhancement of the evolution equation can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>; the resulting equation reads</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">dS dt â (1 â f 2 ) [â¦ â¢ S â S â¢ â¦] = â f 1 [S â g(S) I] + f 2 [âu â¢ S + S â¢ âu T ]<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where g(S) := 3 â¢ III S /II S is a scalar defined in terms of second and third tensor invariants of S and f 1 , f 2 are model parameters calibrated to capture RBC-specific behavior such as tank-treading (rotation of the membrane around the enclosed fluid), relaxation time and areal strain limits. I is the identity tensor and â¦ is a skew-symmetric tensor carrying information about the cell's rotation. The distortion of the droplet is defined in terms of smallest (Î» min ) and largest (Î» max ) eigenvalue of S and is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Ï := (Î» max â Î» min ) (Î» max + Î» min ) .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>In steady, simple-shear flow, induced e.g. by two plates moving in opposing directions, we have â¦ = 0, dS dt = 0 and Equation (3) can be solved analytically with eigenvalues depending on intensity of the shear flow (shear rate). Inserting these into the defining equation for distortion and solving for shear rate G yields the following relation between shear rate and distortion</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">G = f 2 1 Ï 2 f 2 2 (1 â Ï 2 ) .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The definition of distortion in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>is of course not restricted to steady flows only. As an alternative to a direct shear stress conversion as in Equation <ref type="formula">2</ref>, we propose a distortion-based comparative shear stress where the shear rate is taken as a scalar measure for the rate of strain tensor.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Ï css = Âµ f 2 1 Ï 2 f 2 2 (1 â Ï 2 ) .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Applying the proposed method means that at each time instant the comparative shear stress needed in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>is taken to be the shear stress that would lead to the current deformation state in simple-shear flow. Therefore, this model explicitly incorporates both strain history and RBC-specific properties. Note that this implies that stress-and strain-based method produce the same results for simple-shear flow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Cumulative Blood Damage Along Pathlines</head><p>Given a flow field, a particle that is released at the inlet can be traced through the pump. At each discrete time step t (i) we can compute strain-based hemolysis and update particle position x (i) and morphology tensor S (i) afterwards. Using a simple forward-Euler scheme, the updates are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">x (i+1) = x (i) + ât u(x (i) ,t (i) ) S (i+1) = S (i) + ât âS (i)<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where u is the (transient) velocity field and âS (i) is given by Equation (3). From Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>we obtain the rate of hemolysis</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">âH := d dt Hb p f Hb total = 2.8417 â¢ 10 â7 Ï 2.416 t â0.215 .<label>(8)</label></formula><p>The update for cumulative hemolysis H (i) at time t (i) is done using the comparative shear stress obtained for predicted RBC shape S (i+1) . Denoting this by Ï (i) = Ï css (S (i+1) ) and setting</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">âH (i) = âH (Ï (i) ,t (i) )</formula><p>we get</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">H (i+1) = H (i) + ât âH (i)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>which means we compute the temporal integral of Equation (1) along the RBC's trajectory through the device.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Requisites for Visualization</head><p>The iterative blood damage computation as described in the previous two sections provides several output quantities that can be subjected to visualization. For each particle position x (i) we obtain a morphology tensor</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">S (i) with associated eigensystem Î» (i) j , e (i)</formula><p>j . Because the S (i) are real symmetric tensors, they are guaranteed to have three real eigenvalues and three orthogonal eigenvectors. In order to compute these we employ the Jacobi method taking the eigenvectors of the previous step as initial value for the new eigenvector basis. This way one can also avoid an additional matching step for the eigenvectors of consecutive time steps which would be required when using an eigensystem solver that sorts the vectors based on the magnitude of their eigenvalues because â¦ in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>contains the rate of rotation of the eigenvectors.</p><p>In addition to morphology tensors and their respective eigensystems, the strain-based hemolysis computation yields rates of hemolysis âH (i) that are directly related to the cell's shape at every time instant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">BLOOD DAMAGE VISUALIZATION</head><p>In this section we describe the different visualization techniques that have specifically been developed for the visualization of the blood damage information. The pathlines, that are needed to generate this information, can directly be visualized. For this we use a billboardbased technique as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. Scalar hematologic data, e.g., cumulative blood damage or local rate of hemolysis can be shown by standard color coding. Resorting to particle rendering, however, leaves most of the hematologic data unused. A major problem with an effective visualization of this data lies in its complexity. Therefore, we propose different techniques to facilitate an in-depth analysis of the entire blood damage model output in the following two sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Visualizing the Morphology Tensor</head><p>The main task in the visualization of the blood damage data is to convey the deformation described by the morphology tensor and its related information which is available at every trace point. It follows from the mathematical formulation of the blood damage model, that the morphology tensor's eigensystem always describes a parallelepiped with constant volume. Therefore, an iconic representation can be used to depict the deformation at a given trace point. Based on the droplet model shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, we use a spherical template as base shape for the icon. This template is non-uniformly scaled and rotated into an oriented ellipsoid according to the local S (i) 's eigensystem. After this transformation it is translated to the corresponding trace point's position. This process is summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>. For a given trace point x (i) = (x i , y i , z i ) T the entire transformation is described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">T (i) icon = ï£« ï£¬ ï£¬ ï£­ | | | x i Î» (i) 0 e (i) 0 Î» (i) 1 e (i) 1 Î» (i) y i | | | z i 0 0 0 1 ï£¶ ï£· ï£· ï£¸<label>(10)</label></formula><p>The information given by the local eigensystem is crucial for the understanding of the blood damage model. Therefore, and because we wanted to avoid shape ambiguities as stated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, we do not render the ellipsoid as a standard filled shape. Instead, we depict its outer hull transparently and show the eigensystem's scaled axes inside of it. In this way, the eigensystem's rotation is also shown. The transparent hull is used as an additional channel for color coding a scalar quantity, e.g. the local rate of hemolysis.</p><p>Although previous work suggests that the use of transparent geometry may cause issues with the perception of shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> in 3D visualizations, our users did not report such issues during the case study. One reason for this might be that the study was carried out using stereoscopic rendering. However, our study did not directly address perceptual issues and therefore a formal investigation of this aspect remains a point for future work.</p><p>The icon is used for blood damage visualization in two different ways: An animated view showing the evolution over time and a static view which presents an overview of the deformation for an entire path.</p><p>For the animated view, the icon is continuously adapted along a pathline according to the eigensystem information at every trace point. Due to the precision required by the blood damage model, pathlines are computed with a very high temporal resolution. This results in a smooth display of the deformation described by the morphology tensor without the need to interpolate the tensor data. A series of still shots of such an animated view can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref>, which will be discussed in detail in Section 6.2. In this way, the local deformation state and the evolution of the droplet's rotation are clearly depicted. By synchronizing the animation sequence with the display of other visualization primitives cross-correlations to these features can be established.</p><p>Usually, a particle's deformation history during its travel through the entire device is quite long. While the animated icons show the RBC's deformation in the immediate temporal neighborhood, it is rather hard to establish a global understanding of its evolution along the entire path. A temporal overview presents a visual summary of an entire particle path and the corresponding blood damage information. The metaphor is based on multiple-exposure, a technique from photography which captures a moving object on a single image by exposing the film multiple times from the same aspect in rapid succession. This idea is adopted by showing an entire pathline at once and placing icons indicating the deformation state at selected sample positions. In this view, any moving parts of a VAD's geometry are hidden from the user. This is done because these parts are only valid for a specific point in time. Therefore it would not be meaningful to show them in a view that spans a time interval.</p><p>To create the overview, we need to select icon positions along a pathline. The main objective for the placement algorithm is to avoid cluttering by placing too many icons while at the same time showing relevant changes in the data appropriately. This is achieved by an adaptive subsampling strategy which works incrementally by advancing along the pathline and selecting the next sampling position according to a local error criterion. This criterion only depends on the data of the trace points between the last sample position x (s) and the current candidate position x (k) , k &gt; s. Let a (i) be the vector containing all the attributes of x (i) , i.e., its coordinates, the local eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and other relevant quantities, e.g., the cumulative hemolysis. We define g : R n Ã R n â R to be a positive, semi-definite mapping over the space of attribute vectors. In order to determine if x (k) should be included as the next sample position we evaluate a thresholding condition for an interactively specifiable threshold value w tol and last sample position</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">x (s) : k â i=s+1 g(a (i) , a (iâ1) ) â g(a (k) , a (s) ) &gt; w tol</formula><p>The rationale behind this evaluation is that the error resulting from leaving out (x (s+1) , . . . , x (kâ1) ) is not too significant. Options for g include the Euclidian distance and the absolute difference of scalar values, such as the rate of hemolysis âH, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>. Moreover, several criteria can be combined to include several of these aspects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Highlighting Regions of High Hemolysis</head><p>The rate of hemolysis âH defined in Equation (8) is a crucial parameter in the search for the causes of hemolysis. In regions where this indicator is positive, hemolysis actually occurs. A central analysis goal is to identify the regions in which this happens, and as a follow-up examine possible correlations to the flow conditions in the local vicinity and ultimately to the device's shape.</p><p>From the visualization point of view, the problem is that âH is known only for the trace points of the given pathlines, i.e., there is no volumetric representation that could be analyzed using standard (volume) rendering techniques. In order to generate a meaningful volumetric representation one would have to compute a large particle population releasing a dense set of particles for each discrete time step. Instead, we propose a visualization that is directly based on the pathline data and follows the analogy of a virtual blood cell leaking hemoglobin into the surrounding plasma. In order to highlight positions along a pathline, where âH â¥ Îµ for some user-defined threshold Îµ, we place small marker particles in the local surrounding of the pathline. The release rate of these particles is proportional to âH . When this technique is applied to a larger particle population, the resulting marker particle distribution provides a good estimate of the critical hemolysis regions. The marker particles are released on regularly-spaced planes which are orthogonal to the pathline. Hereby, placement is essentially reduced to a local 2D problem in relation to the current particle position. For each plane the positions are determined according to precomputed seed templates, an idea that roughly follows that of dithering techniques. As a general seed template we use a set of concentric circular levels. Each of these levels carries a number of seed positions which is proportional to the level's circumference. For our current implementation we use three levels of varying radii. The total number of potential seed positions is constant for all templates. The templates are generated by labeling the seed positions with random numbers from the inside out, i.e., each level is labeled independently such that the innermost level carries the lowest indices. This leads to a set of randomized templates, which helps to prevent the formation of regular structures in the seeding process. When a template is used to depict a given rate of hemolysis value âH , particles are seeded at the positions of the first n points with <ref type="figure">6</ref>. A user browses the time dependent data in a virtual environment via selection on the temporal overview. In the overview, the active selection position is highlighted (left). Once it is selected by pressing a button, the animation is set to the corresponding point in time and the moving geometry is shown again (right).</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">n = âH â âH min âH max â âH min â¢ n max Fig.</formula><p>where âH min and âH max are the minimum and maximum rate of hemolysis values to be mapped and n max is the number of possible seed positions in the template. For âH outside the interval of [âH min . . . âH max ], n is afterwards clamped to 0 or n max , respectively.</p><p>This seeding strategy generates a random distribution of hemoglobin particles around the pathline that resembles a tube-like shape. Because marker particles are seeded from the inside out, the local rate of hemolysis is not only indicated by the density of marker particles around a pathline but also by the diameter of the seeding pattern. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> shows a blood damage icon that resembles an RBC under hemolysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Plotting Scalar Data for Pathlines</head><p>The pathline-based visualization of blood damage data facilitates a detailed analysis of few selected pathlines. However, in order to gain a more general overview on where hemolysis occurs, we included a quantitative view which is based on 2D function plots. It relates a scalar quantity to a reference axis -usually one of the spatial axesfor an entire particle population at once. In general, the plot is created as follows: For each pathline we iterate over the trace points and create a two-dimensional coordinate (c, a), where c is the point's coordinate along a reference axis and a is the value of a user-defined scalar attribute. The coordinate pairs (c, a) are quantized to a discrete pixel image. For each pixel we count the number of trace points that are mapped to it. Iterating over all particles, this results in a density map of the entire population. This map clearly shows the distribution of the scalar quantity along the reference axis. This is analogous to creating a histogram of scalar values for each interval of the reference axis. In our specific example, the reference axis is the point's local z-coordinate which corresponds to the main direction of flow in the DeBakey data set, whereas the point's z-velocity, shear rate, or rate of hemolysis are chosen as the scalar quantity. The latter two of these plots are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> (left).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">INTERACTION AND VIRTUAL REALITY</head><p>The techniques presented so far have been developed from the outset with a focus on later use in interactive virtual environments. However, because the underlying software is scalable with respect to both display systems and input devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the prototype application presented in this paper runs on a wide variety of hardware platforms. These range from simple desktop systems to a CAVE-like setup in which the user's head position and an additional six degree-of-freedom input device are tracked. Although we have not yet performed formal user studies on this, anecdotal evidence given by users supports the statement of Sobel et al. that stereoscopic viewing greatly adds to the benefit of 3D particle displays <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Navigation around the data set is handled in three different ways: First, on desktop systems, we use a space-mouse like device, which can be used to freely translate and rotate the data set in 3D space. Second, if a tracked wand is available, the user is able to pick up and move the data set by selecting it with a pointing ray. Third, in fully immersive environments like the CAVE, the user may freely move to inspect the data from different angles.</p><p>In contrast to navigation in space, navigation in time becomes a problem when dealing with animation loops containing several thousand time steps. The obvious choice for time navigation is a VCR-like interaction metaphor, where the flow of time is controlled by a set of buttons, e.g., start/stop, step forward, and step backward. However, this metaphor only allows for a convenient inspection of a local temporal neighborhood. It fails when the user wants to quickly jump to a certain instant in time. This problem occurs, e.g., when some interesting phenomenon is identified in the static hemolysis overview. There, every single sample icon symbolizes a specific point in time. We propose a time navigation mechanism, that allows the user to switch to a specific point in time by simply pointing and clicking at one of the sample icons in the overview. The animation loop will then be moved to the point in time for which the selected icon is valid. Additionally, the moving parts of the geometry, which are not displayed in the static overview, will be shown again. Once the search is down to a certain point in time, the standard VCR controls can be used to locally browse the time dimension and analyze the events in the temporal neighborhood.</p><p>On desktop environments, where no direct 3D interaction device is available, we use mouse input to determine the selected icon. In a 3D environment we once more chose a pick ray metaphor. In either case it can be quite hard to pick exactly one specific icon, when using an overview for multiple particle trajectories (see <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, left). To solve this problem we use an implementation of the IntenSelect mechanism described by de Haan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. This mechanism is based on a scoring approach, which assigns a time-dependent score to each selection position. One such selection position is placed inside each icon. For the immersive case, the selection process is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">RESULTS</head><p>As already mentioned in the introduction, the object of our case study is a simulation of the MicroMed DeBakey VAD. The DeBakey's impeller typically spins at rotation rates from 7500 to 12000 rpm providing continuous flow of 2 to 5 l/min. The data set was generated using a finite element mesh consisting of about 3.7 million tetrahedral elements. A single impeller revolution is described by 200 discrete time steps. The total data set size including eight data attributes occupies 28 GB of disk space. For the analysis we used traced particles The processing of the blood damage model is divided into two stages: In a preprocessing step we trace the particles and compute the blood damage information. This data is then analyzed in an interactive virtual environment. We used the following hardware for the performance numbers given in the next section: Particle tracing was performed on a machine equipped with four Xeon X7350 quad core processors and 64 GB of main memory. The blood damage calculation was done on a desktop system featuring a 2.40 GHz Intel Core2 Quad CPU and 4 GB of main memory. Our CAVE-like environment is driven by an 11-node LINUX cluster (1 master node at 3 GHz and 10 clients at 2.8 GHz, 4 GB RAM per node, GeForce 6800GT graphics boards, GBit Ethernet interconnect).</p><p>For the case study, we computed a particle population consisting of a total of 732 traces. These were seeded at the device's inlet face for 12 different positions of the rotating impeller. The total population accounts for about 8.8 million discrete trace points. At each point, the values for 15 data attributes are stored, including the blood damage data. The population occupied a total of 1.7 GB of disk space. In order to increase the manageable population size, we are currently working on the integration of out-of-core techniques as proposed, e.g. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Performance</head><p>We parallelized the particle tracing using a message-passing approach to migrate seed points between distributed nodes. Each node in the distributed system holds the data for a given time interval. The intervals overlap between nodes. Whenever a trace leaves the time frame of its current node, it is sent off to the node owning the data for the follow-up interval.</p><p>The preprocessing time is largely dominated by the particle tracing, which took 1.5 h. This has several reasons: First, I/O is a major bottleneck. Second, a high temporal resolution is required for the follow-up blood damage calculation. Third, a total of eight data attributes had to be interpolated along the way. Finally, the underlying point location algorithm is rather slow and is currently subject to further optimization. The blood damage calculation took 2 minutes.</p><p>During the interactive analysis session observed frame rates were consistently above 60 frames per second (fps) when rendering the particle traces and/or the iconic depictions. For the case study, we used slice-based volume rendering for supportive scalar field analysis, as well as interactive cut planes which could be moved by direct manipulation in the virtual environment. When volume rendering was enabled, the frame rates dropped to about 30 fps. This impact is largely due to the high screen resolution of 1600 by 1200 pixels per projection surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Blood Damage Assessment</head><p>The visualization methods described in this paper have been developed in close collaboration between domain experts and visualization researchers. The case study presented in this section therefore reflects the observations made by domain scientists for a real-world application example. In previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, the analysis was largely based on statistical evaluation of a sufficiently large particle population. Visualization was basically limited to standard color-coded pathline displays. While these methods were sufficient to validate the simulated results against real-world experiments, they did not feature the detailed insights into the process of hemolysis, which will be discussed in the following.</p><p>The interactive analysis started with a first look at the animated particle traces. Two static shots of this animation are given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref>. The traces were colored by the cumulative hemolysis value. Already in this view, an interesting, yet surprising fact could be observed. While the hemolysis level stayed low throughout most of the impeller it quickly rose after leaving the impeller. This observation was supported by both the hemoglobin marker particles and a 2D plot of âH. The interesting part in this observation is that -contrary to intuition -high values for âH do not occur at the leading edge of the impeller, where the blood is initially accelerated, but rather at the outflow.</p><p>For selected particles with high rates of hemolysis the iconic representation was then used to investigate this effect in more detail. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref> gives an impression of the movement and shape evolution of an RBC entering the impeller (top) and passing through the diffuser (bottom); the RBCs entered the impeller largely undeformed, and stayed in that shape until they exited the impeller again. At the transition to the diffuser, they were suddenly highly stretched which resulted in rising âH values. In the static view (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>) one can use the temporal browsing facility to quickly jump to both key positions -the impeller inlet and the impeller-diffuser transition -and analyze the particle's motion in these regions more closely.</p><p>Here, the domain experts made an interesting follow-up observation: Some particles did not directly pass the diffuser. Instead, after passing halfway through, they were drawn back and floated around in the gap between impeller and diffuser eventually heading towards the outlet through another section of the diffuser.</p><p>This observation lead to the hypothesis, that the high rates of hemolysis might somehow correlate with this backflow. Backflow or recirculation are not easily detectable in a general setting. A recent approach can be found, e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. However, in the DeBakey data set the main flow direction is supposed to be along the data's local z axis. Therefore, it is safe to assume, that points with negative v z values resemble backflow regions which makes 2D function plots as described in Section 4.3 a viable first attempt for further analysis. The top plot in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> (left) clearly reveals the following two facts: First, it confirms the existence of backflow areas in the transition region between the end of impeller and diffuser. Negative z-velocity values can be predominantly found in that region. Second, the range of the v z values is widest there, i.e., both large positive and large negative values are revealed at the diffuser's entrance.</p><p>In Section 3, we pointed out the connection of shear rate -that can be directly computed from the flow field data -to hemolysis. Because of its direct influence on hemolysis through Giersiepen's Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>, shear rate is used as an optimization goal.Therefore, the relation between shear rate and backflow regions is analyzed in more detail. For this we use a 2D plot of the shear rate as seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> (left). It indeed shows elevated shear rates in our region of interest. It is reasonable to assume that high shearing is present especially in boundary layers where negative and positive z-velocity values are spatially close to each other.</p><p>Analyses based on plots of flow characteristics along the z-axis are suitable to reveal trends only. Due to the spatial projection to only one axis, the results have to be supplemented by other techniques that show the exact location of backflow regions in the volume. Hence, regions of negative z-velocity were visualized using direct volume rendering. On request of the domain experts, an additional cut plane showing regions of high shear rate was added. Both visualizations operated on a resampled Cartesian grid for the region of interest. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> (right) shows a cut normal to the z-axis through the front part of the diffuser whose geometry is not shown to allow an unoccluded view. Red clouds indicate backflow while regions colored blue on the cut represent high values of shear rate, i.e., above the 90th percentile. The use of interactive visualization allowed not only to observe the shape of the clouds over time, but also to move the position of the cut by direct manipulation back and forth along the z-axis. However, the domain experts found no direct correlation of blue and red areas. While significant backflow was found in the center of each diffuser blade section, elevated shear rates did not occur there. In addition to wall areas, blue areas could be seen at parts of the boundary layers of the red clouds.</p><p>We summarize the following results of interactive analysis. The transition region between impeller and diffuser has been identified as high-shear region leading to high hemolysis rates at the exit of the diffuser. This could be established using marker particles (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>) and color-coding of particle traces (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7)</ref>. Backflow regions were initially indicated by the static views for single pathlines (similar to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>). These could be analyzed in depth using 2D plots and 3D volume rendering (see <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). The recirculation lead to some of the particles being drawn back to the gap between impeller and dif-fuser where they suffer further stretching and release hemoglobin into the blood stream. However, backflow does not directly coincide with high-shear areas. Therefore, it should be included as an independent optimization goal along with minimizing shear rate.</p><p>These results are helpful to engineers who try to improve the device's overall design. In particular they can be used to ease the setup for fully automatic shape optimization, which is a long term goal of our user's research. Here, one needs to restrict the areas selected as optimization parameters to small subsets of the data to keep the computation affordable. The insights derived with the techniques presented in this paper make the diffuser geometry a primary candidate for shape optimization. In addition to the fact, that the diffuser has been identified as such, the observations suggest to extend the objective function used in the optimization process so as to account for reverse flow explicitly, e.g., by including a penalty term for negative z-velocity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper we presented a set of different methods to visualize and assess blood damage in ventricular assist devices. The blood damage model underlying this work is based on particle tracing and the incremental computation of the morphology tensor.</p><p>Referring to the goals stated in the introduction, we can summarize the following: The temporal evolution of an RBC's deformation is shown by the animation of an ellipsoid icon along the pathline, whereas a static overview summarizes the hemolysis state for an entire particle path. The icon design not only depicts the local deformation of an RBC but also allows to follow its rotational movements by showing the morpohology tensor's eigensystem. Moreover, the static overview provides the basis for an interaction metaphor that allows to conveniently navigate transient data sets consisting of a large number of discrete time steps. The seeding of virtual hemoglobin droplets and the use of 2D function plots clearly reveal clustered regions of high hemolysis in the vicinity of the device's diffuser and thus provide valuable hints for further geometry optimization. Our users reported the VRbased interface, most notably direct 3D interaction, to be beneficial in particular for navigation through the VAD's intricate geometry.</p><p>In conclusion, this work presents an example for a successful close collaboration between domain experts and visualization researchers, which leads to specifically designed visualization techniques that ultimately helped the experts to analyze their data and get valuable insights for setting-up automatic shape optimization. <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>.
