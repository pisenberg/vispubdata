				<p>In the field of computer applications to archaeology, data visualization is one of the most recent and promising activity. The visual reconstruction obtained from partially or totally ruined data is a problem that archaeologists often face with during their work. The case we present here is the simulated reconstruction of a great Egyptian tomb of the VII century B.C. excavated in the rocky cliff of the desert. The visualization method is fundamental for testing the hypotheses ma&amp; and as a strategic solution in the concrete reconstruction. The hundreds of magnificent decorated blocks saved by museums will never be positioned again on its walls. Moreover, in front of the stress and pollution caused to ancient monuments by a massive tourism, the ever-growing improving of visualization and animation techniques, like the ones presented in this paper, makes of considerable interest the modeling and the exploration inside the virtual monuments through realistic tours.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The case we present here is the simulated reconstruction of a great Egyptian tomb of the VI1 century B.C., situated at Saqqara, which was the greatest necropolis of one of the most famous cities of ancient Egypt, Memphis, near modem Cairo. The tomb has been archaeologically explored by the University of Pisa, under the direction of Prof. Edda Bresciani, since 1974. During several campaigns the monument has provided a rich artistic and cultural documentation of the last dynastic period in Egypt, in the guise of hundreds and hundreds of evidences. They came from the funerary equipment of its owner, the prince Bakenrenef, visir of Pharaoh Psammeticus I, and his descendants, buried in an underground network of galleries, chapels and shafts going down up to 20 meters. The funerary monument, at ground level, was a princely structure: it was excavated in the rocky cliff of the desert forty meters deep, projecting on the alluvial plain, and was made up by several rooms. Until the first half of last century, the tomb still kept its gorgeous covering and its magnificence was admired and described by several travellers and Egyptologists. But as soon as the interest for Egyptian antiquities grew, thieves had no difficulties to remove the decorated blocks and sell them to museums and amateurs, in Europe and U.S.: you can admire entire walls coming from this tomb in the Metropolitan Museum of New York or the Field Museum of Chicago. Fortunately, some parts of the decoration are still in site and, above all, thousands (about 8000) of blocks and fragments were found, at different degree of conservation, during the archaeological exploration of the tomb, ruined in the shafts or on the ground.</p><p>The first phase of the restoration of the monument took place in the years 1985-1987 and was devoted to the consolidation of the structure, a necessary step in view of the fact that the tomb, excavated in the rock, had been submitted to the geological settling of the area. At present, the restoring program of the imposing building is still undergoing and includes different kinds of intervention, with different problems: the monumental restoration, tending to reconstruct the damaged or lacking parts; the restoration of the decoration, with the repositioning of the survived blocks and the integration of the lacking texts and scenes; the conservation and consolidation of the mural paintings on the ceilings and the painting on the blocks, of the sculptured stones, etc.</p><p>To formulate the hypotheses of reconstruction and of restoration of the decoration, the Egyptologists of Pisa University rely on different kinds of data: geological and architectural data, excavation data, collation with other funerary monuments (based upon a preliminary search of models), ancient drawings, knowledge of the ideology and functionality of religious and funerary architecture in ancient Egypt and, above all, the great mass of data coming from the survived blocks of the covering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">An overview of cases</head><p>In recent years the application of modeling techniques to archaeology have roused an increasing attention, mainly 1070-2385/93 $3.00 0 1993 IEEE (See color plates, p.  in the ambit of the roman and middle age anglo Saxon archaeology <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>. A very famous application is the Project Neapolis, carried on by IBM-Italia (IBM SEMEA) and Fiat, in co-operation with the archaeologists of the Sovrintendenza Archeologica of Pompeii. In a great exhibition <ref type="bibr">(New York 1990)</ref>. visualization techniques were applied to lead visitors in a simulated tour through the reconstructed houses and roads of the ancient Vesuvian town <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Modeling CSG techniques have been applied for the first time in an archaeological context by John Woodwark in 1985, to reconstruct the area of the temple of the roman town Bath and the roman thermal installation of Caerleon [3,4]. Short after, the solid modeler WINSOM was applied to the reconstruction of the Saxon abbey of Winchester, demolished in 1092 to make place to the present cathedral. The archaeologists involved in the project employed a combination of archaeological data, documents and analogies derived from other Saxon churches to hypothesize the appearance of the ancient cathedral. The developed hypotheses were transformed into a WINSOM model. The project included also a two minutes animation which simulated a visit inside the cathedral [5,6,7]. These techniques have been further developed and refined for the analysis and visualization of Klinglberg excavations in Austria [5] and for the reconstruction of the Fumess abbey <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The cited works have the common characteristic of having been realized on big computers and requiring a computer knowledge rather sophisticated to be used. Toward a different direction is oriented the work of Gill Chapman for the Lancaster Archaeological Unit 191: the model he has realized is based on a software which run on PCs or SUN and provides good quality images, yet with a lower content of scientific information.</p><p>The software RenderMan (Pixar Inc.) was used on an Apple Macintosh I1 and four Transputers by Janice Comforth and Craig Davidson <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref> to make a threedimensional image of a reconstructed dining room and courtyard at the Fishbourne Roman palace, Sussex, England. We also know an application in Japanese archaeology: a computer-generated tour of a computerised reconstruction of a village of Yoshinogari (Kyushu Island, Japan -200 B.C. -AD 300).</p><p>Since 1988 the French Archaeological Mission at Saqqara, leaded by professor Jean Leclant, has used 3D visualization techniques, to rebuild the external and intemal architecture of the funerary unit of king Pepi I <ref type="bibr">[ll]</ref>. Up to now the work of the French architects have been devoted only to render intemal and external volumes and architectonic srructures, without affording the problem of returning decorations nor trying a realistic reconstruction of different materials, presently simulated by different chromatic conventions only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Why visualization ?</head><p>Computer based methodologies have been applied to the archaeological restoration of the tomb since 1985. The use of a data base was successfully experimented to rebuild wall decorations. In the data base were introduced informations related to two thousands blocks out of the total eight thousands, partially found during the archaeological survey and partially saved in museums. The data base contained also digitalized images of each decorated face. With this system it was possible to make automatically the first hypotheses of restoration, thanks to the rapidity of finding various parts from the data base. At that time it was also hypothesized to get an automatic visualization of the images on the selected wall. The effect was good but it was still through a fundamentally 2D techniques.</p><p>It became soon clear that the visualization method would have been fundamental for a double range of reasons: as a powerful tool for testing the hypotheses made and as a strategic solution from the point of view of the concrete restoration of the monument. In fact, the hundreds of magnificent decorated blocks saved by museums will never be positioned again on its walls; moreover, the number of survived blocks, both in the tomb and in museums, is so scant in comparison with what is lost that, in many cases, we should physically have only few islands of blocks in a sea of bare rock.</p><p>This double range of requirements means that we need a visualization satisfying a high level of accuracy, images of high quality and optimum resolution of details, very fine restitution of colors and relieves. As a working model, visualization must grant to an archaeologist precision; as a virtual restoration, must be extremely realistic.</p><p>The department of Scientific Visualization of CNUCE, Institute of the National Research Council of Italy (CNR), has operated in the field of graphics for long time and is being particularly active, at present, in data visualization and animation for various computational and experimental sciences (mainly environmental sciences, molecular dynamics and work of arts conservation). Most researches in these fields, have been promoted and funded by the CNR National Project on Parallel Computing <ref type="bibr">(1989)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1990)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1991)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1992)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1993)</ref> which has given a great impulse to the developments of parallel techniques, systems and visualization, in Italy.</p><p>The restoration of the visir tomb presents problems which are not dissimilar from the other scientific disciplines: it calls for synthesizing the scientific information into an exhaustive virtual model and for setting up exploring metaphors for the model.</p><p>The complete model includes the geometric model which describes the volumetric architecture, and the visual model which keeps track of decorations and wall materials (wall coverings, paintings, low-relieves) according to the restoration hypotheses formulated by the archaeologist. The model extends its validity over time as well since it includes the modifications of different historical periods.</p><p>In order to present the model to the archaeological community, a simulated visit of the tomb has been created which assumes the form of a spatio-temporal travel among decorations which, often, are not really on site or structures belonging to different historical periods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Discussion of results</head><p>Some of the hypotheses of reconstruction worked out and the animation have been used to illustrate suitable visualization methods. Our selection has privileged an exemplification of the different problems met with and their different solutions.</p><p>For instance, in the case of the exterior parts of the tombs, almost entirely damaged, it is evident the importance of being able to dispose of different hypotheses of reconstruction (the original faGade ruined in consequence of the erosion of the rocky cliff).</p><p>With the vestibule, we have faced the problem of the subsequent interventions on the monument (XXX dynasty and roman age), showing in the animation the actual state, the modifications of roman age and, finally, the ancient Egyptian decorated walls concealed by the roman structures. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> shows a particular view of the vestibule, as it would be if the roman walls could be removed.</p><p>In a correct methodology of restoration, even a virtual one, the possibility to distinguish accurately the existing parts from the integrated ones is fundamental. In the subsequent phases of the animation, two different approaches are proposed: a static one in the pillared hall and a dynamic one in the next room. The static method conventionally employs whitish surfaces and architectural contours for indicating parts whose reconstruction hypotheses are not yet tested, coloured visualization for tested hypotheses (blocks contours are suggested, for discriminating survived parts from the integrated ones) and simulated rock where we still lack hypotheses. The dynamic method allows to stress the different provenance of the blocks involved in the reconstruction of a given wall, adding pieces in a fixed sequence: blocks in site, blocks found in the tomb, blocks in museums, integration and so on.</p><p>Finally, the funerary shaft of the prince offers us the opportunity to experiment the visualization as historical tool, replacing in its original context the stone sarcophagus of Bakenrenef, actually exposed in the Archaeological Museum of Florence, where the Egyptologist Ippolito Rosellini brought it in 1828 <ref type="figure">(Fig.  3.)</ref>.</p><p>In this work more emphasis has been put on the integration of graphics tools rather than the construction of a unitary interface for the final user. Our approach requires a considerable variety of technical knowledge and the availability of a hardware/software platform so rich in functionality (scanner, graphics engine, digitalPAL converter, etc.; geometric modeler, image processing, renderer, animator, previewing facilities, etc.) to make the solution, at present, not irrelevant in term of cost and working time. Although the system, at present, can be used only by a programmer, the integrated modules represent a well structured set of tools and a prototype for a definitive archaeological visualization system.</p><p>The need for a high degree of flexibility in modifying the model has been achieved by means of easily editable external procedures which describe the appearance of each wall. These procedures (also called shaders) are used at rendering time when the real color of a wall is to be computed. A large exploitation of textures, bump mapping and displacement shaders has been made. Texturing techniques have been adopted not just to simulate wall paintings but to recreate the depth effects of bass-relives, lost during digitalization, as well.</p><p>To create the animation we have adopted various scenic and choreographic criteria so as to experiment different effects. Starting from the model of the tomb containing different levels of information, we have afforded the problem of what to look at and how. The kernel of the animation is the simulation of a walk through the tomb by an hypothetical visitor who sometimes pauses to admire decorations, turn up his eyes to look at the painted vaults and has also the possibility to switch on different types of lights (for example he/she uses a torch to highlight a small zone). At the same time it is as if he/her can switch on/off a sort of virtual button to produce different restorations of a room according to the different hypotheses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion and future developments</head><p>The achieved results are very promising indeed. As virtual restoration, visualization allows to give a substantial contribution to the most ticklish questions of the modern debate in the archaeological field: how and how much to restore? Restoration or preservation? Which materials? What to do of later intrusive structures (i.e.. in our case, the roman wall concealing the ancient Egyptian paintings)?</p><p>The ever-growing improving of visualization techniques makes within reach a future of more and more realistic tours inside the virtual monuments on the screen, a tool we must not underestimate in front of the stress and pollution caused to ancient monuments by a massive tourism. As for our case, we imagine beside the effective restoration a permanent exposition, as much as possible interactive, illustrating by means of animation the architectural history of this monument. For the work in progress we call for the possibility of replacing in the original context the hundreds of objects coming from the tomb and now no more in site. This will imply a big effort in the direction of user-friendliness and user interfaces.</p><p>(See color plates, p.  The Egyptologist's work would be greatly facilitated by the existence of a bank of blocks and decorations to select and position into the geomemc model. There are still limitations in automatic methods and algorithms to prepare a bank of images to be used for decorating the three dimensional model. The original material, in fact, is often represented by photos made by the archaeologist in different (or bad) illumination conditions, with various perspectives, while it would be necessary to provide the rendering software with homogeneous images for a correct reproduction.</p><p>Good interfaces for the archaeologists are still to be developed due to the complexities and richness of tasks that the archaeologist is to perform. Construction, manipulation of models and availability of different data, demand for multimedia and interactive working environments.</p><p>The solution we have proposed states once again that time dependent visualizations offer a wider spectrum of possibilities for studying and understanding a scientific model than single views, one at a time. On the other hand, animation is still realized as a slow and deferred process while the future of archaeological visualization demands for real time modification and exploration of the model space.</p><p>To improve the quality of the scientific information transmitted through the animation, scenes of the actual tomb should be inserted for comparison with scenes of the virtual reconstruction, as it is partially suggested and experimented by our animation.</p><p>Our approach represents a significant innovation in the archaeological field both for the high quality of the result and the major emphasis put on the realization of a high level working model than a definitive reconstruction. Much work is still requested to the computer graphics experts to set up techniques for decorations, for certifying colors, for simulating effective illumination models (how was the real effect of light in the tomb and how did decorations look like?)</p><p>The artistic aspect of monument restoration is not to be forgiven and we have faced this aspect in our work, as</p><p>well. An Egyptian tomb like the Bakenrenef tomb is a work of art and the restoration must transmit the artistic contents. It is of great importance the beauty of the images (color, illuminations, fidelity of decorations) as a means of communication to experts but also to the public and institutions.</p><p>T j~e Virtual Restorutiorz of the Visir Tomb, P.
