<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Several systems for visualizing data have recently been developed with the intent to free users from the burden of graphics programming <ref type="bibr">[7, 8, 13, 15, 16,</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr">281</ref>. Why do many application programmers still prefer writing their own visualization code over using such visualization systems? In part, this may be the case because applications such as biomedical imaging, robotics, seismic data analysis, and wood classification require highly interactive user-customizable tools to explore and interpret their data <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Stand-alone systems, such as EXVIS <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, KBVision <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> and PVWave Point &amp; Click <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>, have provided various data exploration tools. Yet, such systems become hard to adapt to new aspects of visualization research, due to their monolithic structure. To provide flexibility, other systems, like AVS <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>, offer visual programming interfaces with which users can assemble their own networks of communicating programs (modules). Despite such flexibility, these new systems have until recently not been well suited for data exploration because they have lacked essential interactive capabilities. For example, the X-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> AVS module to display images used to encapsulate all user interaction within the module, providing no feedback t o other modules. Application programmers could not exploit the full interactive power of X in their own AVS modules'. This missing feedback channel was crucial because users need to probe the data and define regions of interest. They also need to see the selected areas in relationship with other data, such as in a collection of C T scans shown side-by-side on a screen. Interactivity involving several windows could not be achieved easily using the programming style of AVS.</p><p>Current systems also dilute the distinction between two concepts, data representation (storage) and data presentation (display). Users often need to view the same data in many different presentations. It is important that users be able to define mappings between selected dimensions of a data set and a set of available display capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">9,</ref><ref type="bibr">13,</ref><ref type="bibr">151</ref>. Systems must also be able to mix several data types in a single view, such as geometric data and array data.</p><p>This paper describes a system designed to help users analyze data interactively. It uses the network editor and the data flow model of AVS-V4. But it changes AVS-V4 in most other respects. Our system provides tools to merge data of different data types into a single view, overlaying geometric data on images. Its new X-based display data module also provides a feedback channel to make user interaction available through an output port t o other modules. All our modules send a log record along with the data in which they record coordinate transformations, as well as other descriptive information about the data. Other modules can then use the log record to relate a selected window position to the pixel position in the original data set. With this mechanism, we can at-tach arbitrary data exploration and data interpretation routines to windows and establish linked cursors between any number of windows. We can establish very flexible telecollaboration arrangements by sending windows to other displays. Colleagues can then annotate the same data a t both displays.</p><p>The next three chapters present three different aspects of our approach: a ) the distinction between data representation and data presentation, b) data exploration tools, and c) telecollaboration capabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data representation versus data presentation</head><p>There are many ways to view a data set. Typically, images are shown as images, histograms as graphs, etc. This practice dilutes the distinction between two concepts, data representation (storage) and data presentation (display). Data exploration applications often need to see the same data in different presentation styles, depending on the exploration focus. Users need to define mappings between specified dimensions of data sets and sets of available display capabilities [2, 9, 13, 151. Stand-alone systems, such as EXVIS <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, have explored various presentation styles like icons or sound generation. But the systems are hard to adapt to new aspects of visualization research, due to their monolithic structure. In contrast, our data presentation tools are available as separate modules which can be easily exchanged. Geometric and intensity-based presentations can be combined into a single view.    Many applications, such as biomedical imaging, need to explore their data, not merely view it. They need interactive data probing tools and mechanisms to establish visual relationships between different parts of the data' Interleaving: Several images can be overlaid in a single window by interleaving the data pixel-bypixel. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Presentation styles</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Data mapping</head><p>When the data is presented in a particular style, it typically needs to be adapted to the limited capabilities of the hardware. In particular, unbounded or high-precision data values need t o be adjusted t o the specified range of the display device. Such mapping can take various forms: linear or non-linear scaling, subsampling or interpolation, cropping or thresholding with a specified maximum and minimum, wrapping modulo a specified value, substitutions according to a user-defined lookup table, random substitutions, permutations, and combinations of all of these techniques. Many such concepts are well-established colormapping techniques. Yet, the concepts can apply equally well t o other dimensions of a data set, providing concepts, such as thresholding (cropping) and non-linear scaling (warping) to geometric dimensions or time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Interactive data probing</head><p>We have extended AVS by providing a feedback channel through which users can send arbitrary cursor and keyboard commands from the display windows back into the AVS networkwhere the commands are then available to any suitable module. With this extension, users can interactively set up many different data probing arrangements. We will now present several example data exploration applications which use the feedback channel. It is important to note thatalthough the examples do not provide new capabilities but that we provide an improved infrastructure in which it is easy to interactively arrange for such data exploration functionality and to customize it. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows a very basic data probing arrangement on a C T image of a human chest. The setup consists of three modules which read the chest image, display it, and overlay a software-cursor. When a user selects a pixel in the image, the display data module sends the position as part of a log record through the feedback channel to the position cursor module. Since any number of modules could, in principle, have preceded the position cursor module and altered the geometric arrangement of pixels in the window (e.g., via zooming, warping, scrolling, projections, etc),the selected window position is not necessarily identical to the array index of the pixel in the image. the window position into the correct array index. It then sends geometric drawing commands back to the display data module to overlay a cursor on the image data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Regions of interest</head><p>The data probing arrangement can be extended to define a region of interest, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> . The crop image module selects a subarea from the chest image, using the cursor position and the log record to determine the subarea (the black rectangle in <ref type="figure">Figure  5)</ref>. A second display data module shows the cropped area in a second window. Interactive window resizing allows users to zoom the view. Statistical data analysis, such as the computation of mean and variance or other moments, can also be performed on the selected region of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Cursor linking</head><p>We provide cursor linking capabilities to help users explore the relationship between several data sets. In a typical cursor-linking arrangement , several windows each have their own software cursor to indicate the current cursor position. The cursor can be repositioned in any window, affecting the cursors in all windows. Live links for visualizing the relationship between several data sets are available in some current visualization systems [15, 281. Yet, those are closed systems without a visual programming interface. They provide only limited capabilities which cannot be extended easily by the user.</p><p>In our system, users can configure arbitrary cursorlinking arrangements of varying complexity. In a simple case, linked cursors show corresponding pixels in images of identical dimensions and size, such as two C T images. In a slightly more complicated case, the cursors are linked between images of different sizes, such as between different levels of an image pyramid or between an image and a cropped and zoomed subimage. The cursor-linking mechanism then has to multiply the pixel index with the appropriate scale factor or add the cropping offset. In yet more complicated cases, the linking mechanism can be used to help visualize the relationship between data sets of different dimensions, such as an image and its histogram. Such cursor linking arrangements will now be presented in detail. The demonstrations are examples of a very general concept. Any two data sets with a known semantic relationship can be linked by inserting the appropriate transformation algorithm into the cursor linking arrangement. Further examples could include cursor transformation mechanisms for non-rigid image warping, fish-eye views, the histogrammed analysis of some derived image properties (such as edges, texture, and flow vectors), or the joint visualization of C T and MR data. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref> shows two registered pre-and post-contrast MR images of a human head. A third image shows the pixel-wise differences. The bright pixels indicate areas which the solution has penetrated. On the screen, the images are shown in three windows with linked cursors: When a user identifies an interesting position in one of the windows, the corresponding pixel positions are marked in all three windows. The network in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref> shows that this functionality is achieved by multiplexing the cursor positioning output from all three display data modules in the network through a cursor funnel and then sending it on to three position cursor modules. Each position CUTSOT module creates geometric drawing commands which are then sent back to the respective display data modules. The log mechanism ensures correct cursor positioning even if diffekent windows show the data a t different scale factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Cursor linking between several images</head><p>The same cursor-linking mechanism can be used to explore corresponding pixels on several levels of an image pyramid in computer vision applications. The lowest level of the pyramid shows the image a t full resolution, higher levels of the pyramid show the data at increasingly lower sampling rates. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Cursor linking between images and histograms</head><p>The cursor-linking mechanism can also be used to establish relationships between windows with very different types of dimensions, such as an image and its histogram. In this case, selected cursor positions flow through special transformation modules which establish the correct relationships between image pixels and histogram counts, i.e, they use the data value of a selected image pixel as the index into the histogram.</p><p>We use the cursor linking mechanism to explore the relationship between color images and color histograms (three-dimensional scatter plots). A color histogram consists of four <ref type="figure">dimensions, ( r , g, b, count)</ref>. It is stored as a <ref type="figure">volume, with each voxel ( r , g, b)</ref> indicating how many pixels in the original color image have this particular color value. The color histogram is presented, using a 1;-buffering algorithm and ignoring all  <ref type="figure">( r , g , b )</ref> according to their position in the histogram.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref>, the blue and yellow rings from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  1</ref> and its color-encoded histogram are shown side-byside. The left branch of the network above shows the modules which process and display the color image. The modules in the right branch operate on the histogram. Users can outline an area in the color image with the module handsegment. The system then generates a new color histogram, using only the pixels in the outlined area. Conversely, users can also outline an area of the color histogram. In that case, the system marks all image pixels which have colors in the selected part of the histogram. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref>, a small area, outlined in red, has been selected in the color histogram. The resulting image pixels are marked in red, indicating an interreflection area between the two rings.</p><p>Color histograms can be used in a similar way to develop automatic wood inspection algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In such research, various impurities, such as knots and stains, need to be detected and classified. They typically cause color shifts in the wood, yet they are hard to recognize automatically.  The semantics of any relationship between data sets can be encoded in transformation modules. Extensions to higher-dimensional data sets, such as data bases of census data or financial data, can be created.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Telecollaboration</head><p>Telecollaboration is integrated in our data exploration environment. All capabilities available to one user are also available to two or more users working on the same problem. This approach stands in contrast to current practice where users have to switch back and forth between exploring data in one system and sharing the results in a different system.</p><p>We can provide integrated telecollaborative capabilities because we combine cursor linking with a window migration capability. Users can send any window to any screen simply by specifying a display name parameter. We have successfully demonstrated telecollaborative arrangements between Chicago and Boston as part of the Innovation Showcase at Siggraph 92, as well as between Boston and Sweden. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>: Basic tele-collaboration network.</p><p>Our system gives users the flexibility to set up collaboration environments with various degrees of complexity. In a simple case, collaborators share one window, with a mechanism to allow each person t o independently annotate the data, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>: Two display d a t a modulesone of which may send the window to a remote displayeach receive the same input data. The feedback channels of both modules are sent to annotating modules which generate sequences of differently colored drawing commands. The drawing commands from both windows are then merged and sent back to both display modules so that the annotations are shown in both windows. This arrangement is amenable to teleradiology applications where a radiologist and a surgeon jointly want t o annotate an image. Each can annotate the data in a different color, both see the results. Users can also share more complicated exploration arrangements, such as the joint analysis of the preand post-contrast MR images of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref>. In the process, collaboration partners can individually customize their views, e.g, by resizing or repositioning (See color plates, p.  their own windows. Specific modules, such as colormapping modules, can also be inserted into individualized data presentation paths to accomodate collaborators with different viewing preferences. If one collaborator wants to see the data in a different presentation style than the other person or if he wants to enhance the image, he can be accommodated as well. Such individualized exploration capabilities in a telecollaborative setup are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>. Along similar lines, the color histogramming network can provide individualized three-dimensional viewing orientations <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>.</p><p>We expect these telecollaborative capabilities to be an important extension to data exploration. Many data exploration tasks in real applications are group efforts rather than problems solved by an individual. There will be an increasing demand for systems that allow researchers to share their views and truly explore them with their colleagues. The current situation where researchers explore data in one system and share it in another one is an obstacle to remote collaboration. Our system can enhance existing teleconferencing technology in this respect. Existing systems provide sophisticated techniques to send compressed image data and sound for real-time teleconferencing. Tools also exist to share and edit arbitrary X-based windows on several displays <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>. Such tools are well suited for sharing text windows but they lack the means to provide in-depth exploration capabilities for large data sets. We expect future telecollaboration systems to combine traditional window sharing and teleconferencing arrangements with data exploration systems to analyze large data sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>Data exploration imposes special requirements on visualization environments. It requires a high degree of interactivity which has been ignored by current visualization systems. Our system is designed to provide interactive data exploration capabilities. Built on top of AVS, it benefits from the visual programming paradigm that AVS provides. By making feedback from the user directly available to all modules and by introducing a log scheme between modules, we have been able to change AVS from a pure visualization system into a data exploration system. In this new system, users are able to interactively select pixels in windows, perform arbitrary operations on them, and redisplay them in many different ways. Selected pixels can be cross-linked between several windows with different data sets and sent around the world for telecollaboration arrangements between remote colleagues. Furthermore, we provide many different techniques for displaying data, and for mixing and merging data from several data sets into a single view.</p><p>These capabilities are essential to many data exploration applications. We thus expect our system to open up scientific visualization environments to new classes of applications. It has already been used to analyze color variation on wood samples, and to investigate reflection properties on plastic objects for computer vision research. It is an integral part of ongoing biomedical research at our research lab, and we have demonstrated its telecollaboration capabilities on several occasions.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Color image of scene with plastic objects.</figDesc></figure>
