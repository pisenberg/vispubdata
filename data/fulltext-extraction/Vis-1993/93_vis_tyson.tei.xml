			<abstract>
				<p>We discuss a system which provides a single, unified model of oil and gas reservoirs that is used across a range of disciplines from geologists to reservoir engineers. It has to store, manipulate and display reservoir phenomena which are observed over several orders of magnitude from Imm to IOkm. We propose that the current capabilites of visualization, over this range of scales, can remove perception barriers that have existed between disciplines and provide clear insighs into the problems of modelling reservoirs from geological and engineering perspectives.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Oil reservoirs have traditio~lly been simplified by reservoir engineers as blocks as homogenous material for the purposes of flow simulation. The computing constraints imposed by the current generation of reservoir simulators limit the total number of grid blocks to an upper limit of under 100,000 blocks and a typical working size of less than 30,000 blocks. The reservoir itself will have an areal extent of the order of 1-15km in each direction and vertical depth around 10-50 metres. There will often be 20-40 blocks in each horizontal direction. This gives the approximate grid block size at a simulator level as around 300-5OOm horizontally.</p><p>Most of the information about the rocks in the reservoir is obtained from wells which penetrate the reservoir. However, the number of wells which have been drilled even in a comparatively well developed field would be less than a hundred. The data gathered from the well is of the scale of the well bore diameter, 20 cm or so, and the spatial sampling of the field 100 wells over 200 square km is sparse. Horizontal wells can improve the areal sampling of the dataset though, in general, the location of a horizontal well will be an end result of a modelling project.</p><p>Geologists attempt to provide an accurate geological model for the reservoir using the well data and any analogues they find in outcropping formations. Reservoir engineers are more interested in the effective behaviour of large scale blocks and will make approximations in the rescaling of the original geological model. In newer simulations the grid may be refined locally around critical features such as wells and faults. The provision of a unified model which may be used to represent the geological model accurately at a small scale and provide a means of controlled rescaling of the effects of large numbers of small scale features is considered important in the improved simulation of reservoirs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Initial work</head><p>To build the cooperative visualisation system we first collected together widgets for the input and manipulation of traditional geological and engineering data so that data would be input directly into a unified model rather than into standalone packages. We classify our data on a scale from hard to soft depending on its reliability. Core data, the rocks taken from the well itself, is hard data, outcrop data from similar rock where they are exposed in cuttings and cliffs is less hard since it may have slightly different properties to its analogue in the reservoir, whilst the geologist's intuition, still a valid data source, is classified as soft. Our main data source is well data from logs or cores. We chose to ignore seismic datasets, at least in our first implementation because we felt that seismic data is generally used for the determination of the gross geometry of the reservoir rather than its internal characteristics. The present resolution of seismic data is not normally sufficient to provide much information about the heterogeneities that affect the flow in the reservoir. In addition to well data we store information about the geometry of reservoir features which has usually been measured from outcrop studies or satellite photographs. To complete the reservoir model we generate stochastic realisations using the observed distributions from the hard core data and well log data to the progressively softer outcrop data.</p><p>Currently there are two different camps in stochastic reservoir modelling; the grid-based generations such as HERESIM[l] and GEOLITH <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>  IREX uses an object modelling approach. The system under development is codigured to be able to provide both types of modelling since there are distinct advantages with either system; grid-based approaches are often simpler to program but required more space, object methods rely on good and efficient computational geometry. We realise the need to be able to transfer between the alternative approaches and are providing tools to convert between grids and objects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grid-based methods</head><p>Grid-based modelling algorithms superimpose a regular or near regular grid over the modelling region. The hard data is analysed for spatial variation and each block in the grid is assigned parameter values based on the measured hard data values. This will generate a number of realisations for independent variables such as Permeability. This technique is useful in situations where the reservoir departs from the purely homogenous approximation by relatively small variations in the permeability of the sand from block to block. It cannot cope with rapidly varying permeability variation or large numbers of small baniers. The gross geometry of the system can be difficult to capture. However, in many cases it is a good approach which provides an intuitive and straightforward transition from the small scale geological model to a coarser grid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Object methods</head><p>An alternative is to generate polyhedral objects which correspond to observed features that are thought to occur in the reservoir such as shale barriers, stylolite barriers. high permeability sand channels, fractures and so on. Each object itself is defined within the system by a set of attributes. Some of these attributes are geometric such as the thickness of a shale barrier and may be represented as constant values or distributions either continuous distribution functions or as discrete distributions measured from geological analogues.</p><p>Attributes may depend on other attributes or may be related to 2D maps. Non-geometric attributes such as permeability and porosity are also defined.</p><p>We can represent an object type by a subset of the finite set of all attributes used in the generation of all objects. The mapping of the object onto a coordinate system is a projection of the object's geometric attributes onto real space. This step is separated from the generation of objects so that we can easily map the generated object onto non-Cartesian systems. At the same time, this abstraction enables us to regard complex shapes as a union of projections of the object set into 3D primitives. We create complex shapes as collections of hexahedra since this shape can be handled by commercial flow simulators.</p><p>As reservoir studies reveal more attributes far an object-type these too may be added to the system. The sensitivity of the reservoir's flow behaviour to different attributes may be determined as more complex attribute sets are added to the system. This is particularly usrful in directing geological field work.</p><p>The modelling process involves sampling these attributes at random to create objects within the model which will observe the measured distributions of those objects in a reservoir. A single stochastic generation will not recreate the reservoir being modelled, but a large number of realisations of the modelling process will provide insights of the expected reservoir behaviour and the range of possible behaviours. We are then able to make good estimates of reservoir volumetrics and optimum well patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data storage -Gridded Data.</head><p>Gridded datasets did not present any significant problems for storage. However, we were able to take advantage of some of the work that we did on octrees for the object data stores to create a hybrid grid-tree structure to control a local grid refinement dynamically. This is similar to the adaptive mesh structure defined by Hermitte[61. This feature would be used in flow modelling so that the refined area of the grid propagates with the fluid flow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data storage -Object Data</head><p>Our first attempts at storing and analysing the generated polyhedra sets floundered on the problems of determining the intersections of about 50,000 randomly placed polyhedra. Investigations of storing pointers to the polyhedra using octrees gave good results when the polyhedra were not evenly distributed in space. When the random objects were more evenly distributed it wa, 0 more space efficient to overlay a regular grid over the region and search the grid blocks containing the polyhedra under test for possible intersection candidates. Our struggle with data storage was often because the models that we generated contained totally different data. A candidate data structure for large numbers of small thin objects became inefficient when used for much larger objects. or even in the presence of a few very large objects. We wanted to capitalise somehow on the size of the objects themselves rather than have it hinder the datastore.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussions of spatial databases appear at present to be limited to CAD databases and 2D GIS systems [71,[81.</head><p>The Skip List algorithm 191 provides simplicity in implementation and inherent self-balancing capabilities. It is simply a linked list with additional pointers to elements further down the list. Whilst some elements in the skip list may have several additional pointers the overall average number of pointers per element is around 1.1 to 1.4 so the increase in space is not large. In the original algorithm a level is chosen at random such that a proportion of the nodes in one level also have a pointer at the next level up. A modification of the generation of the random level involves selecting a point from the cumulative distribution function of sizes of objects in the data store. For large datasets this will approximate to a random number sequence. This provides some fairly basic size dependent features providing that the fraction of nodes with level i pointers that also have level i+l pointers is limited to between 0.5 and 0.25 and the distribution of the key values of these pointers is independent of the size used in the level cdf.</p><p>We investigated hB-Trees [lo] very briefly but felt that the algorithm was considerably more complex than the skip lists. The advantages it had over skip lists appeared to be good guaranteed performance and good response to modification. We did not require good performance on repeated insertions and contented ourselves with statistically managing the dup list.</p><p>The skip list can be rebalanced at any time using statistics of the size dimension. Similarly. if a cdf is maintained of the x,y,z positions within the datastore, range queries may be optimised by searching the dimension with the smallest probability of a point in that region first.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gridding and Rescaling</head><p>For both types of modelling we choose typical realisations and those representing behavioural extremes from the range of generated models to determine the sensitivity of the flow performance to the geological model. These models would be rescaled to the reservoir grid block scale for input into a commercial flow simulator.</p><p>The two different types of model may be rescaled to a reservoir simulator in different ways: I ' h e rescaling process will replace a number of small gnd blocks in the geological model with a single larger block for the simulator model which has the same effective properties as the original small blocks. Provided that the different geological grid blocks don't vary too wildly a variety of upscaling methods exist. Some of these are compute intensive. Approximations may be used depending on the original geometry of the geological system.</p><p>For the object models a regular grid may be overlaid on &amp;e system which essentially converts it to a geological scale system and the same grid-based upscaling process may be used. Alternatively. since the object model will have considerably fewer objects than the grid model the reservoir simulator grid may be distorted to fit the object model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scale independence of system</head><p>The current system may be used to model a complete reservoir or may be used in the determination of the properties of a small block from part of the reservoir because any scale dependencies in the object and gridded systems have been designed out. The same techniques are therefore as applicable in the generation of a block of heterogeneous rock as in the whole reservoir. This facility provides good controls on any automated or semi-automated rescaling processes as well as providing a test environment for rescaling schemes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further work</head><p>The simplicity of the skip list algorithm offers easy experimentation with multiaimension pointers and scale self similarities. This is an area which we are currently exploring.</p><p>The object modelling relies on a shape library of attribute dependencies and distributions which is being expanded as different reservoir heterogeneities are analysed. Currently under review are hydraulically stimulated [ll] and natural fractures. We are experimenting with gridding object models within each object. The advantage of this approach is that it combines the simplicity of the gridded stochastic Each record in the list is given a level L and has L forward pointers. The pointer for a given level I points to the next forward node with at least I levels. method:. with the geometry preservation inherent in object modelling.</p><p>We are improving the control and visual analysis of the generated models by adding virtual cores and virtual outcrops of the generated models, both for the gridded and the object models. This will provide both 1D and 2D distribution control of the generated models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unsolved problems</head><p>The current rescaling solutions for gridded systems are known to be limited. We are aware however that these issues are currently the subject of much research worldwide [121, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>,[141 and will incorporate appropriate solutions into our system as they are developed.</p><p>Rescaling of object models depends on the objects being modelled; flow conduits would be treated differently to flow barriers. The techniques for rescaling are advancing whilst the capacity of reservoir simulators is increasing. There are already rumours of some companies using around a quarter of a million grid blocks in simulators. Analysis of the original geological model and the approximations available for upscaling may determine whether such detail is in fact necessary.</p><p>We still haven't solved the problems of visualizing data at a range of scales; what to display and what not to display. We need to develop a set of visual cues to indicate that a displayed object is the effective sum of a number of small objects. This may indeed tum the object data structure around again into a more hierarchical dataset store.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>We have presented a single unified model as the basis for future reservoir characterisation. Even at this early stage in our development we have observed benefits that alter working practices and improve interdisciplinary understanding. This common appreciation of the problems of complex reservoir description by engineers and geologists provides a solid basis for future development of tools and techniques to improve the success of exploration and development of oil reservoirs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>lists are linked lists with additional pointers.</figDesc></figure>
