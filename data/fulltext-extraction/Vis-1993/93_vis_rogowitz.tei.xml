				<p>In Rogowitz and Treinish [20] we introduced an architecture for incorporating perceptual rules into the visualization process. In this architecture, higher-level descriptors of the data, metadata, flow to perceptual rules, which constrain visualization operations. In this paper, we develop a deeper analysis of the rules, the prerequisite metadata, and the system for enabling their operation.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Data Structures and Perceptual Structures</head><p>Modern visualization software systems support a wide variety of choices for mapping, manipulating and rendering data. Typically, the mechanism for making these selections is based on the structure of the data. Recently, we presented a framework for improving current systems <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>. First, we suggested that visualization operations be cast in terms of operations on higherlevel representations of the data, metadata <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>. These metadata would, for example, represent the dynamic range of the data or the geometric relationships between the objects in the scene. Second, we introduced the notion of visualization rules which the user could invoke. These rules would provide guidance on the selection of visualization operations based on principles of human vision, cognition and color theory <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>. If selected, the rule would constrain the way in which the data would be mapped onto visual dimensions. The metadata, thus, define a higher-level characterization of the data which both provides a higher-level interface to the user, and a higher-level input to visualization rules.</p><p>The purpose of visualization rules is to help insure that structures in the data are faithfully represented in the image, and that perceptual artifacts are not erro-neously interpreted as data features. To accomplish this goal, it is important to understand how the human observer processes spatial variations of luminance and color, and how variations in the physical representation affects its interpretation. There are a few classic references on the representation problem [1] <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref> as well as several more recent papers describing characteristics of human perception and cognition important in the visualization process <ref type="bibr">[ 161[11][6][ 121[81 [271[91[191</ref>  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows a scheme for categorizing twodimensional data, based on dimensionality and rank (scalar: rank=O; vector: rank=l; tensor: rank=2). An array of temperature values, for example, would be a two-dimensional array of scalars, or rank=O. The table also shows typical visualization strategies for each category, with different strategies for discrete or continuous data. For example, a continuous array of scalars, such as temperature data, may be equivalently represented by a contour plot or deformed surface, or by a gray-scale or pseudo-color image.  The top row shows 1) temperature mapped onto a gray-scale value, 2) isothermal contours drawn over the surface, and 3) the surface of the slab deformed in proportion to the temperature value, respectively. The bottom row shows temperature mapped redundantly by the three representations taken two at a time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mathematically-Identical # Perceptually Identical</head><p>The importance of human perceptual and cognitive mechanisms in visuabzation is demonstrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures  2 and 3</ref>, which provide eight representations of the same data, the temperature of the earths atmosphere at a pressure of 100 mb. In each representation, global temperature is shown on a two-dimensional slice with the equator running horizontally. Although these are the same data, and all representations are mathematically equivalent, they look very different perceptually, and could lead to very different interpretations.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, for example, the apparent dynamic range of the data and the perceived variability of the temperature vary from image to image. Furthermore, these representations can interact perceptually. For example, adding a contour map to the deformed surface representation decreases the perceived turbulence in the temperature data.</p><p>Similarly, the two discrete representations of the temperature data in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 3</ref> give very different visual impressions. For example, in the deformed dot surface representation (left-hand image), there appear to be intermittent yellow spots along the front ridge. In the wireframe representation (right-hand image), the front ridge looks as if it is yellow across its horizontal extent. These differences in perception could lead to differences in data analysis and interpretation.</p><p>Since the goal of visualization is to provide a representation which helps the user interpret hisher data or communicate its meaning, it is important that the mapping from physical dimensions to perceptual dimensions be under control. If the perceptual effects of mathematically-equivalent representations are different, clearly the mathematical characterization of the data is not sufficient to predict their appearance. In this paper, we deal explicitly with the mapping of data dimensions onto perceptual dimensions, through a system of rules.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">Perceptual Rules</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rogowitz and Treinish (1993)</ref>, we identified two classes of rules which are important for the visualization process <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>. Class I rules are designed to insure that the structure of the data be faithfully represented in the visualization. These are either rules for providing an isomorphic mapping from data to perceptual dimensions or rules for insuring the perceptual invariance of higherlevel visual features, such as color, size and shape. Class I1 rules intentionally transform the structure of the data to highlight features in the data to attract attention, scale dimensions to exaggerate details, or segment the image into regions.</p><p>(See color plates, p .  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceptual Isomorphism</head><p>The goal of many visualization tasks is to create a faithful, isomorphic, representation of the data. In an isomorphic mapping, for example, a two-fold increase in the dynamic range of the data, would be perceived as a two-fold increase in the intensity of the visual dimension. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 2 and 3</ref> show clearly, however, that a two-fold increase in one perceptual dimension (.e.g., brightness) may not appear to have the same perceived magnitude as a two-fold increase in another (e.g., height). In fact, it is possible that none of these representations is perceptually isomorphic to the structure of the underlying data.</p><p>Classic experiments by Stevens have shown that perceived magnitude is often a power function of physical magnitude, but that different perceptual dimensions have different slopes [23]. Perceptual rules which were "aware" of the psychometric functions for brightness and height could correct for this difference, so that an equal change in the magnitude of the data would be perceived as equal changes in perceived magnitude, independent of the representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Highlighting and Segmenting</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-Isomorphic Color Scales</head><p>Whereas perceived brightness and perceived height are good codes for variations in intensity, other commonly used scales are not. For example in many visualization systems, the default color map paints the lowest value in the variable blue and the highest value red, with a linear mapping of the data range onto a numerical, red-green-blue representation of hue. This produces a color scale which does not look like a continuous variation in hue, but rather, looks like bands of color [15] <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Mapping a continuous variable with a perceptuallydiscrete colormap can lead to several visual artifacts <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>. For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 4</ref> shows that the perceptual discretization of the color range into distinct color bands can mask intensity variations. A fixed increment in data value falling in the "yellow" range of the spectrum would produce a perceptual variation from yellow to yellow, and would not be detected. The same magnitude increment at a slightly higher intensity would produce a perceptual variation from yellow to red, and would be detected.</p><p>This effect is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, where the atmospheric temperature data shown earlier are mapped onto a rainbow-hue colormap (left-hand image) and onto a monochromatic, Gouraud-shaded, deformed surface representation (right-hand image).</p><p>The color-mapped image gives the impression that there are very few temperature variations in the "yellow" region while the deformed surface representation reveals significant temperature variation. If the goal is to represent the fine spatial structure of the thermal variation, the rainbow-hue colormap is clearly inappropriate. The continuous variation of temperature cannot be represented isomorphically with a dimension which is perceptually discrete. The top two quadrants show a flat plane and a deformed surface pseudo-colored according to a continuous rainbow-hue colormap. In the bottom quadrants, the colormap is explicitly divided into five discrete color regions (blue, cyan, green, yellow and red). In all four images, the user sees discrete, segmented ranges of color, but in the discrete colormap case, the boundary between color regions has a crisp quantitative interpretation.</p><p>A perceptual rule which "knew" whether the goal of the representation was to provide an isomorphic or segmented representation could guide the user in selecting the appropriate color map. The continuous colormap, thus, would simply not be recommended for an isomorphic representation. It would also not be recommended for a segmented representation, since the perceptual boundaries occur at unknown data values. A discrete colormap, on the other hand, would be a good candidate for representing image segments, since the perceptual and data-value boundaries are identical. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 6</ref> shows how these perceptual relationships hold whether the data are represented by a two-dimensional plane or by a deformed surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multiple Data Representations</head><p>Quite frequently, the goal of the visualization requires that the data be characterized in several ways. For example, a surface may be colored according to one variable and contoured according to another. It is important that the perception of one variable not interact with the perception of the other. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows a colored plane and a colored deformed surface with isothermal contours. In the top row, the color varies continuously; in the bottom row, it is binned into five discrete semantic categories. In these data, the color and the contours connote identical numerical regions. In the continuous color representations, the perceived extent of the colored regions is affected by the high-contrast contours. In the top right quadrant, for example, the front ridge looks like bands of blue and bands of green, bounded by contours. A closer look, however, reveals that the boundary between the blue and green regions is actually not confined within the boundaries. This effect is due to the fact that the luminance mechanisms in human perception have higher spatial resolution than the color mechanisms. The high spatial-frequency, highcontrast contours "lock in" the lower resolution color [18]. One strategy for avoiding this perceptual artifact is to construct the contours, then flow discrete colors into the appropriate regions. This is shown in the bottom two representations of <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Luminance and Color Cues</head><p>Representation problems can also occur because the visual dimensions available in a visualization system may actually vary along more than one perceptual dimension. The rainbow color map is an excellent example. Unless special care is taken, the brightness, as well as the hue, will vary across the range. Blues and reds, for example, will typically have much less brightness than the cyans and yellows. Thus, while the hue could give one message, the brightness could give another. The colored deformed surfaces in Figures 6 and 7 show this effect. Although the red color connotes the region of highest temperature, the fact that it is a low-luminance red causes the highest peaks of the deformed surface to appear flattened. The highest temperature regions, thus, appear to be lower than their yellow neighbors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">An Architecture for Rule-Based Visualization</head><p>Earlier, we proposed an architecture for explicitly incorporating principles of human vision, perception and color theory into the visualization process <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>. This architecture is built on a functional data model of selfdescribing data structures with both logical and physical organizations, and a schema relating them. This simple model addresses the fundamental dimensionality, rank and parameterization of data [2] <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>. The model's data structures drive visualization operations, which in turn are constrained by visualization rules. The appropriate visualization rule is selected based on higher-level characteristics of the data, known as metadata. Metadata relevant to the visualization process include, for example, image statistics, whether the data are discrete or continuous, and spatial coherence. Representing data in terms of higher-level abstractions provides a more intuitive and more efficient interface to the visualization process. For example, operations on statistics (.e.g., dynamic range and standard deviation) are more efficient than operations on arrays. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows the visualization process supported by many modern systems, and the modification to that system which provides for rule-based operations. In the basic system, data flow to visualization operations, such as processing, realization and rendering, which are driven by the structure of the data. A complementary layer for providing rule-based guidance is shown in gray. In this layer, higher level characteristics of the data, metadata, flow to visualization rules, which constrain the operations chosen by the user. Rule-based visualization raises the level of the visualization process in two ways. First, the user interacts with the visualization tool in terms of a higher level characterization of the data. Second, this interaction is mediated by rules based on human vision, cognition and color theory, which guide the user in the selection of appropriate visualization operations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 9</ref> shows the parallel operation of data and metadata. In the conventional data-structure driven operation (on the left), data flow to operations. In the metadata-structure driven operation (on the right), the metadata flow to the rule which constrains the operation, based on properties of the metadata.  <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> illustrates the design of rule-based operations for a color mapping operation. In this example, the user can route the data through the default color map, or through a rule-based color map. In either case the invocation of the process is the same. The righthand figure illustrates how .the rule is implemented. The rule-based operation provides several candidate color maps, each appropriate to data with certain characteristics. The metadata, which contain information about these relevant characteristics, flow into the rule, which selects the appropriate color map. Metadata may either accompany the imported data (e.g., whether the variable is continuous or binned) or may be computed as needed by the rule (e.g., dynamic range). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="111.">Implementation</head><p>We are implementing our rule-based arcMtecture with the IBM Visualization Data Explorer (DX)l Several aspects of the DX architecture make it particularly amenable to our approach, including a unified approach to handling data, system extensibility, polymorphic operations, and the support of user-defined extensions to self-describing structures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unified Approach to Data Handling</head><p>A unified mechanism for data handling facilitates the implementation of data-independent applications. In our application, it eliminates the need to develop different sets of rules and metadata for every type of data to be supported and allows the extension of this approach to cover a broad range of data and visualization operations. The single unified data model of DX provides such a mechanism, supporting many classes of interesting scientific data and the data access services to utilize them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>System Extensibility</head><p>In order to avoid building an entire visualization system to implement our rule-based architecture, we selected an extensible visualization system as our base.</p><p>Ease of extensibility at the developer's level is important because it allows us to rapidly prototype and incorporate our rules and architecture.</p><p>In our application, we are using two of the three interfaces DX offers for extensibility. The programming API, which provides data support, error handling, and access to lower level tools, is being used to develop low-level rule-based modules. We are also developing rule-based macros via the high-level visual programming interface. In this environment, macro development can take advantage numerous computation, realization and rendering operations, including, for example, operations on underlying geometry, field mapping, and realization techniques. Our first rule-based macros, for example, take advantage of scalar realization techniques for creating contours, isosurfaces, and surface deformations. As this work progresses, we will consider strategies for vector and tensor data.</p><p>System extensibility at the user's level is also important in our approach. We advocate giving the user at the visual-programming or scripting language level choice over when and whether to invoke rule-based operations. We also advocate giving the application developer choice in deciding how to present rule-based operations to the end-user. This flexibility is supported by DX.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Polymorphism</head><p>Polymorphic operations handle multiple data types with a single interface, and therefore appear typeless to the user. In DX, for example, the "Isosurface" module will create iso-value contours if it receives twodimensional scalar data, and iso-value surfaces if it receives three-dimensional scalar data. The module selects the appropriate algorithm, transparently to the user. This apparent typelessness, when coupled with interoperability, maximizes the flexibility for the user in invoking operations anywhere in a program.</p><p>We have defined our rule-based operations to be typeless and interoperable by extending the lower-level data structure polymorphism of the DX modules to a higher-level, perceptual structure polymorphism. These characteristics give the user flexibility over when and where to invoke rule-based or standard operations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Support of Extensible Data Structures</head><p>Extensible data structures provide a mechanism for introducing and managing additional classes of data. This facility is important since our architecture hinges on the use of another class of data, metadata. Otherwise, there would be no mechanism to store, query, retrieve and utilize higher-level descriptors of the data. The open architecture of the DX data model allows us to customize the data descriptions by adding the metadata necessary for the implementation of rule-based operations.</p><p>In a visualization process, information must be shared among various operations. In particular, metadata which flow to or are computed by one module should be shared with subsequent modules. This is accomplished in DX by passing pointers to data "objects" in shared memory. Our rule-based operations, thus, query the data objects they receive for prerequisite metadata or derive that information if it is not available. Based upon the metadata, the appropriate standard DX operations will be invoked to create a rule-constrained output object, as was shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>.</p><p>Data Explorer (DX) is a portable, flexible, general-purpose software package for scientific data visualization. It employs a data-flow-driven client-server execution model and is currently available on Unix workstations from several manufacturers and a parallel supercomputer <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. It is built on a foundation of a generalized data model <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 11</ref> is a schematic of how data might be organized to support rule-based operations. The data themselves are part of a field object which includes additional components required to drive visualization operations, including, for example, geometric and topological characteristics [e.g., positions and connections]. This structure easily supports the addition of other types of data, including metadata field components such as statistics and dynamic range. This, then, is an instantiation of the parallel organization of data and metadata illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 9</ref>. This datdmetadata parallelism is further expressed within components. Each component consists of structural information (scheme), attributes (metadata), and actual numeric contents (a multidimensional array).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data and</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. Discussion</head><p>The architecture described in this paper is built on the assumption that visualization is intrinsically an interactive process. Our contribution is a mechanism for enhancing the effectiveness of each iteration by providing guidance to the user in the form of visualization rules. These rules are based on principles of human perception, cognition and color theory. Their role is to help the user select visualization operations which map the data onto appropriate perceptual dimensions, minimizing perceptual artefacts and creating an appropriate representation of the data. In all cases, the user is free to select rule-based or default operations, and can specify whether the goal of the visualization is to create a perceptually isomorphic representation or to highlight particular relationships or features of the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expert Systems vs. Human Systems</head><p>Recently, Donald Norman, a philosopher of modern technology, observed that the best technologies provide a wealth of information and function, but leave control in the users' hands <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. Our approach follows this model, and goes a step farther by providing interactive guidance to the user on how best to control the features and functions of complex visualization systems.</p><p>An alternate methodology for providing guidance to users is the expert system approach. In this model, the system uses rules to arrive at the "best" image, operating in a batch-like mode to produce the end result. The user has little control over the process. This means that the intelligence which drives the selection and application of rules is built into the system, and therefore makes no use of the natural intelligence of humans. Taking control out of the users' hands robs the process of the impressive human capabilities to recognize patterns, generate hypotheses, and modify visualization strategies based on these observations.</p><p>Expert systems in visualization follow the tradition of application to well-defined problems in a closed domain, such as data base systems [3][4]. Thus, expert systems for visualization have been developed for presentation tasks [ 5 ] , and/or have been driven by results of database queries <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. They assume that given data, they can generate an appropriate picture utilizing a knowledge base of rules <ref type="bibr">[21][22]</ref>.</p><p>In current visualization systems, there are many classes of data, multiple visualization strategies, and an increasing domain of operations and mappings. Furthermore, in interactive visualization, and especially for exploratory tasks, the domain is open because there is incomplete knowledge. Moreover, the user's knowledge changes and the problem domain is modified with each iteration.</p><p>Whereas a traditional expert system cannot cope with dynamically changing knowledge, a system where the user is an active participant in the application of rulebased operations capitalizes on it. The user in this environment can take advantage of expertise in color theory, perception and cognition without giving up flexibility or control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rule Interaction</head><p>This paper provides a first step in providing an architecture for rule-based visualization. In our first implementation, we are focusing on rules based on relatively simple characteristics of the data, in particular, the selection of luminance and color maps for continuous and discrete data. In our initial approach, we implement the rules on an operation-by-operation basis. Clearly, however, the invocation of some rules will have an effect on others. For example, a rule for mapping color onto a spatial area may produce an unexpected perceptual result if the system is not "aware" that another rule has placed high-contrast contours over that same spatial area. Some of these conflicts can be resolved by sharing metadata across components of a field, but a more sophisticated rule-management capability will eventually be required to interactively resolve conflicts among rules.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Extensibility of Metadata and Rules</head><p>The system we have described where metadata flow to rules which constrain visualization operations can be extended to handle different types of data, including auditory or tactile data, and can be extended to accommodate more complex visualization environments. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref> shows how metadata and rules can be extended. The first row shows the type of metadata and rules we are implementing currently to map continuous data onto perceptual dimensions isomorphically. Some physically continuous dimensions, such as a rainbow-hue color map do not appear continuous, and even those which do appear continuous, such as grayscale and deformed surface, have different perceptual intensityresponse functions.</p><p>The second row shows what the metadata for a Class I1 or highlighting rule might look like. In order to draw attention to a region of high spatial correlation, the metadata must contain information about the (x,y) values along the two functions being compared, must know when they occupy the same location, and have a mechanism for computing correlation and a decision rule for identifying high values. Based on this information, the perceptual rule could highlight the target regions by rendering their pixels in bright yellow.</p><p>The third row extends the visualization into the third dimension, where a Class I rule is called to insure that the perceived color of an object is invariant, even when enclosed in a translucent colored region. The rule needs metadata about the location and colors of objects in three-dimensional space, and needs to understand perceptual color-mixing rules in order to recommend appropriate color choices. The rule that the objects should contain no complementary hues is demonstrated in the top row of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 13</ref>. The blue and green spheres continue to look blue and green when enclosed in the translucent green object. The red spheres, which share complementary hues with the green object, lose their red color, becoming yellow or orange. This figure also demonstrates the failure of size invariance to hold when objects of the same size have different luminances (the red and blue spheres look smaller).</p><p>In developing this rule-based system, each new rule will establish requirements for the necessary metadata to enable them. requirements for the necessary This more comprehensive set of metadata, in turn, will show us where additional mapping rules are required, resulting in an iterative design process where rules and metadata develop together. This may lead to a taxonomy of metadata and an associated class of rules and operations, and will certainly lead to a richer understanding of the characterization, representation, and perception of data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task Dependence of Rules</head><p>In this paper, we discuss the implementation of Class I (isomorphic, structure-preserving) and Class I1 (segmenting and highlighting) rules. There is a second level of analysis which we plan to address in future implementations, which is the role of the task in ruleselection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Rogowitz, Kellogg, and Ling (1992)</ref>, for example, have distinguished between exploration and analysis tasks and presentation tasks <ref type="bibr">[ 191.</ref> In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rogowitz and Treinish (1993)</ref>, we showed how both types of tasks can make use of Class I and Class I1 rules. In many exploration and analysis tasks, it is important to provide an isomorphic representation of the data, so that perceptual artifacts are not interpreted as features in the data. It can be argued, for example, that the medical fields have been slow to embrace digital imaging technologies because there is so much less control over the representation of data. X-rays may be limited, but at least the photograpkc process produces an image whose relationship to the underlying data is well-understood. Highlighting [Class 111 rules might also be important in exploration tasks, to segment regions in a multispectral astronomical image for example, to locate star populations. Or, a task might require rules to insure the veridical perception of one dimension, such as the spatial extent of two variables, and a highlighting rule to draw attention to an area of high spatial correlation; a Class I rule to define the area of a tumor and a Class I1 rule to classify it by color.</p><p>In presentation tasks, the goal is often to communicate or drawing attention to certain key features in the data, such as a key DNA sequence or a depleted region in the ozone layer. Highlighting rules can accomplish this by transforming the color, scale, brightness, temporal frequency (flicker) or geometry of that feature. But highlighting can be important in an analysis tasks as well. Color can be used, for example, to segment regions in a remotely-sensed image to identify and discriminate newly forested regions and regions with great tree loss.</p><p>Although this taxonomy of visualization rules (isomorphic vs. highlighting) and visualization tasks (exploration vs. presentation) is overly simplistic, we believe it provides a starting point for thinking about visualization goals and processes, and helps focus discussion on the types of metadata should be provided in order to enable task-dependent rules.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. Conclusions</head><p>This paper builds on two ideas: 1) first, that perceptual and cognitive rules are important because they allow the user to control the visualization process, and 2) second, that an architecture supporting rule-based visualization can be implemented within the structure of a visualization system which provides a unified datahandling model, system extensibility, polymorphic operations, and support of extensible data structures. These building blocks allow us to construct a visualization architecture where higher-level descriptors of the data flow to visualization rules which constrain visualization operations based on this information.</p><p>We have shown some examples of how constraining visualization operations can help reduce perceptual artifacts. We believe that these visualization rules will help users interact more effectively with their data, help them explore the relationships they contain, and better communicate their meaning. We believe that the introduction of rule-based operations will help users take better advantage of their natural human capabilities for pattern recognition, hypothesis generation, and intuition. Our goal is to improve visualization systems so that people spend less time trying to create the right picture and more time inventing and exploring hypothesis about the processes underlying the data.</p><p>An Architecture for Rule-Based Visualization, B.E. <ref type="bibr">Rogowitz and L.A.
