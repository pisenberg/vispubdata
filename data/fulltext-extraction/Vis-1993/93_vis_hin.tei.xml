			<abstract>
				<p>In this paper a new method for visualization of threedimensional turbulent flow using particle motion animation is presented. The method is based on Reynolds decomposition of a turbulent flow field into a convective and a turbulent motion. At each step of particle path generation a stochastic perturbation is added, resulting in random-walk motions of particles. A physical relation is established between the perturbations and the eddy-diffusivity, which is calculated in a turbulent flow simulation. The flow data used is a mean velocityfield, ana&apos; an eddydiffusivity field. The erratic particle motions are more than just a visual effect, but represent a real physical phenomenon. An implementation of the method is described, and an example of a turbulent channel flow is given, which clearly shows the random particle motions in their context of generalfluid motion pattems.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The opening sentence of a well-known book on turbulence <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref> reads: 'Most flows occurring in nafure or in engineering applications are turbulent'. Turbulence has many different appearances in daily life: turbulence in the earth's atmosphere, like cumulus clouds; eddying of fluids at discharge locations; stirring the cream in a cup of coffee.</p><p>Besides, turbulence is also an important research topic in fluid dynamics. Although there is no generally agreed definition of turbulence, most literature agrees that turbulent flow has certain characteristics: it is a threedimensional, rotational, irregular, random, diffusive, and dissipative phenomenon. Turbulence occurs at high <ref type="bibr">Reynolds numbers</ref>, and it is a feature of the flow, not of the fluid. It is a continuum phenomenon, governed by the laws of fluid mechanics <ref type="bibr">[ 191.</ref> An important effect of turbulence is the mixing of fluids. Due to turbulence, fluids with different characteristics will eventually become homogeneously distributed. In some cases, this mixing is advantageous, e.g. the discharge of cooling water into a river with minimal effect on environment temperature. On the other hand, turbulence can accelerate the dispersion of pollutants, and can cause serious problems such as heavy load conditions on buildings or underwater structures, or bad flight conditions for an aircraft.</p><p>In recent years, visualization has become an important tool in computational fluid dynamics research. Laminar (non-turbulent) flows are characterized by velocity vector fields, often combined with scalar fields such as pressure, or temperature. The structure of velocity fields can be visualized using arrows, streamlines, stream surfaces, or moving particles [ l 11, while scalar fields are visualized using volume rendering techniques <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Turbulence research focuses on the development of fluid dynamics models; data generated by these models are often representations of turbulence intensity by quaptities such as turbulent kinetic energy or eddy-diffusivity. Instead of describing turbulence as the kinematics of the moving fluid, the amount of turbulence is represented by a single scalar field, which is a measure of turbulence intensity. These data can be visualized separately by techniques from volume rendering, but this can result only in static images that do not show the dynamics of turbulent motion. Sakas <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref> gives an overview of 'optical modelling' and visualization techniques for turbulent motion. The modelling methods described there are mainly physically-based synthesis techniques for obtaining realistic effects for computer animation. Visualization techniques used for these models are rendering techniques for volume density textures <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17]</ref>, giving the impression of moving and evolving clouds, with good realistic effects for animations.</p><p>Our goal is to find useful visualization techniques for the exploration of data obtained from fluid dynamics simulations, with particular emphasis on the important dynamic aspects of turbulence. With volume density textures, these effects are shown indirectly as fluctuating densities, not by motion of the fluid itself. Thus, dynamics are not visible in areas of equal density, but only where significant density variations occur in time and space. Thus, an effect of turbulence is shown rather than the turbulent fluid motion itself.</p><p>For visualization of turbulent flow, it is important that the dynamic turbulence effects are shown as fluid motion, so that the same visual representation is used for the mean flow motion and turbulent motion. Therefore, we want to present in this paper an extension of the methods of particle motion animation for visualizing turbulent flow.</p><p>The discrete nature of moving particles captures the essence of fluid motion, and is often used in experimental visualization <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">10]</ref>, and more recently in computer graphics visualization as well [2]. Particle systems, as introduced by Reeves [ 12,131, have been successfully applied to flow visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper we will propose a new visualization technique based on particles to show fluid motion and turbulence in 3D. Turbulence is viewed as a random perturbation of a mean velocity field; locally varying random components are added to the mean flow. The turbulent particle motions are modelled as stochastic perturbations. The result is that random motions are added to the smooth particle motions in the mean flow, providing an integrated visualization of velocity and turbulence. The data used for this visualization technique are a mean velocity vector field and an eddy-diffusivity field. A statistical turbulence model is then used to reconstruct the turbulent motions from these data.</p><p>In section 2, we will briefly review the technique for particle path integration in a steady velocity field, and describe Reynolds decomposition as the basis for the turbulence model used. Next, in section 3, the generation of turbulent particle motions is described, providing the physical foundation for the perturbation technique. In section 4, the algorithm for particle path generation is presented, incorporating the turbulent motions. A brief description will also be given of the implementation environment. Then, in section 5, the resulting visualization technique will be illustrated with a turbulent channel flow, and section 6 gives conclusions and outlines research directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Fundamentals</head><p>In particle tracing, a particle is released at a starting position xo at time to and travels with the flow. The travelling path consists of subsequent positions xi, visited by rhe particle at time ti. These positions can be determined by integrating the velocity field u(x,t) over a time step:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">'i+l xi+l = xi + U(X, t) dt (1) I t.</formula><p>During the integration process, the mean velocity at position X i must be determined by interpolation of the velocity field between the nodes of the mesh. A way to model turbulence is based on Reynolds' statement that a turbulent flow may be decomposed into a mean flow and a fluctuation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[14]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">u(x,t) = ii(X,t) + u'(x,t) (2) In this Reynolds decomposition, i? (x,t) is responsible</formula><p>for the local convective (translational) motion, and u'(x,t) causes a local turbulent motion. In these Reynoldsaveraged models, the Reynolds-averaged Navier-S tokes equations are solved with simplifying mathematical assumptions for the Reynolds-stress tensor to ensure the closure of the state equations. Depending on the type of flow (e.g. boundary or free shear layer), appropriate assumptions must be made to model the turbulence properly (e.g. using Prandtl's mixing length model or a k-L model; see ref.</p><p>[ 151 for these and other examples).</p><p>To express the dynamics of turbulent motion, we focused on the spatial variability of the fluctuations as an important characteristic. Particle motion will emphasize this aspect more than the nebulous effects of volume density textures. This resulted in the idea that the mean velocity and some turbulence intensity field could be mapped to a particle's motion and a random perturbation. In figure 1 the determination of subsequent positions of a particle is shown for a non-turbulent flow and a turbulent flow. In the convective part of the latter the local mean velocity i? is involved. The direction of the perturbation is chosen randomly on a circle (or sphere in 3D), while the magnitude of the local turbulence intensity determines the radius of the circle (or sphere). To clearly show the effect of the perturbation, the velocity in figure l a and the mean velocity in figure l b were taken to be constant.</p><p>To describe the fluctuations a particle will perform in a turbulent flow, a statistical approach will be used. In the next section, this approach will be discussed, and the derivation of physical quantities from fluid mechanics involved in the convective motion and random perturbation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Generating turbulent particle motion</head><p>Particle motion in a turbulent flow can be simulated by random-walk models <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>. These random-walk models are based on a fluctuation equation where a random component leads to perturbed paths of individual particles through a flow. Tracing many random-walk particles will show the effect of turbulent diffusion. This diffusion process is described by a forward-diffusion equation, which is thus closely related to the fluctuation equation. In fluid mechanics, the advection-diffusion equation is the common way of modelling transport of material. In the remaining part of this section it will be shown how coefficients in the fluctuation equation are related to coefficients in the advection-diffusion equation.</p><p>A random-walk method for modelling 3D particle motion is based on the 3D Langevin fluctuation equation</p><p>[1,61:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">dXa(t) = V a dt + D a dWa</formula><p>in which Xa(t) is the random position of a particle as a function of time in the a-direction (a = x, y, or z), v,(x,t) is the drift coefficient in the a-direction, Da(x,t) is a coefficient for the a-direction related to diffusion, and  <ref type="figure">N,(O, dt)</ref>. Here Xa(t) is a Wiener process with drift, or a diffusion process [SI.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">W(t) = [W,</formula><p>Although physically not quite correct, it is assumed here that turbulence can be modelled in 3D space by three mutually independent Wiener-Levy processes.</p><p>(3)</p><p>The probability density function f(x,t) for a particle's position X(t), where X(t) satisfies the stochastic differential equations of (3), is a solution of the forward-diffusion equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">[5,8]: a f a a a at --ax vxf --v f -%VZf a y y ---</formula><p>which is also known as a Fokker-Planck equation.</p><p>In fluid mechanics, transport of material without dissipation is modelled by an advection-diJ%sion equation, which for 3D is given by:</p><p>where c(x,t) is the concentration of the material, ua(x,t&gt; is the mean velocity in a-direction, and Ea(x,t) is the eddy-diffusivity, which is a measure for turbulence intensity.</p><p>To obtain the coefficients va(x,t) and Da(x,t) of the fluctuation equations (3) in terms of the physical quantities Ga(x,t) and Ea(x,t), we must compare the advectiondiffusion equation with the Fokker-Planck equation. Since concentration c(x,t) is equivalent to mass density m(x,t), we can rewrite the advection-diffusion equation <ref type="formula">5</ref>into: with:</p><p>Equations (4) and (6) are now written in a similar form.</p><p>The probability density f(x,t) is assumed to be equivalent with the mass density m(x,t), which is justified by the law of large numbers applied to an infinite number of particles <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>. From the similarity between (4) and (6) it can be concluded that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">D a = d 2 E a<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Here we see that the drift term va(x,t) is not equal to the mean velocity Tia(x,t) (as was suggested in section 2), but contains a correction originating from the spatial variability of the eddy-diffusivity. We also see that Da(x,t) is related to the square root of the eddy-diffusivity Ea(x,t). The fluctuation equation <ref type="formula">3</ref>then becomes:</p><p>with Xa(t) the position of the particle in a-direction ( a = x, y, or z), and Na the trivariate normal distribution, with mean = 0, and standard deviation = dt. Now we have shown how particle motion and perturbation can be generated from a mean velocity field li(x,t) and an eddydiffusivity field E(x,t) with a normal distribution N.</p><p>In the general case the eddy-diffusivity E is a vector quantity specifying non-isotropic turbulence for the three coordinate directions. In the special case of isotropic turbulence, Ex, Ey. and E, are everywhere equal, and thus E will be a scalar value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Implementation</head><p>In the previous section, we used the fluctuation equation to describe particle motion, and derived its coefficients from the similarity between the forwarddiffusion equation and the advection-diffusion equation. It was shown that the integration of particles through a turbulent flow is based on a mean velocity field and an eddydiffusivity field.</p><p>Although in section 3 the equations have been derived for the general case of time-dependent data, we will assume here a time-independent mean data field. This is not a restriction inherent in the method, but it has only been made for the sake of clarity.</p><p>We will describe now the implementation of the particle motion algorithm, based on equation 8. The same notation will be used here, but in practice the time differential dt is replaced by a time step At, and the spatial partial derivatives of E are approximated by differences. Instead of using a normal distribution N(0,At) in each fluctuation equation, it is adjusted to a standard normal distribution N(O,l), and next, to a uniform distribution U using the central limit theorem <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. It should be noted that aparticle path is constructed from integration through the flow field using a large number of small time steps. By calculating each random step from a uniformly distributed fluctuation equation, the summation of random samples quickly converges to a standard normal distribution. In (8), we will therefore substitute Na = =U, ,</p><p>with Ua = random number from a uniform distribution in the range [-$,+;I.</p><p>To integrate from particle position xi to xi+l, the following steps must be taken: determine U(Xi), E(xi) and its gradient by interpolation from the discretized fields, calculate the convective displacement from determine a normalized random direction vector from three random numbers, calculate the perturbed displacement by multiplying the random vector with I,/= add the perturbation to the convective displacement to determine the total displacement from position xi.</p><p>The tracing algorithm has been implemented in a testbed for flow visualization research <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. The testbed runs on SGI workstations, and provides a suitable development environment for new visualization techniques, as well as an environment for prototyping, testing, and evaluation of these techniques. It extends from the data generation stage, where CFD simulations can be performed or data can be generated analytically, to the display stage, where flow dynamics can be animated. Beside the particle tracer, a particle renderer is included to generate images from a direct mapping of the spatial and temporal aspects of the particles. Both the particle tracer and renderer will allow us to show the suitability of visualizing 3D turbulent flow by means of particles.</p><p>The particle tracer uses a mean velocity field and an eddy-diffusivity field to create particle motion and perturbation as described earlier in this section. For path integration, the second-order Runge-Kutta method is applied. Tracing of a particle can end when it leaves the flow area or its lifetime is spent. To prevent a particle from leaving the flow through a wall a bouncing operation is implemented. During integration, each calculated particle position and time is stored in its particle path. Other information (in which we may have interest during visualization) can be added to the positiontime combination, e.g. local velocity, eddy-diffusivity, or temperature.</p><p>The particle renderer creates an animation of the flow using light-emitting particles. The particles can be displayed simply as dots, as line segments to reduce aliasing in animating the flow, or as path lines to show the trajectories of specific particles in the turbulent flow in a single image. The additional information stored with the position-time combinations can be used to colour the particles. The pictures generated also show the flow area, and underwater structures like surge barriers or diffusors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Example: a turbulent channel flow</head><p>To illustrate the presented visualization technique of perturbed particles we consider a turbulent flow in a channel. For this case, mean velocity and eddy-diffusivity fields are generated mathematically, and used to determine convective motion and random perturbations for the paths of particles, according to the implementation described in the previous section.</p><p>Formulas for mean velocity and eddy-diffusivity profiles related to simple channel flows can be found in CFD literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">20]</ref>. From these formulas a mean velocity field ?i (x) is derived with a logarithmic profile in the vertical direction and the horizontal direction perpendicular to the flow, and an isotropic scalar eddydiffusivity field E(x) (see section 3). Eddy-diffusivity is derived from an algebraic eddy-viscosity model with influences from vertical changes as well as horizontal changes in the velocity profile <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref>. The mixing length in the vertical direction uses a parabolic Bakhmetevfunction, while it increases linearly with the distance to one of the channel walls.</p><p>From the 3D velocity field and eddy-diffusivity field the particle tracer determines perturbed paths of particles released at the inlet of the channel. In figure 2 the perturbations of particles during their joumey through the turbulent channel are clearly shown using path lines. In this case particles were released from sources positioned at a line across the width of the channel at the inlet. The line segments of the paths are also colour-coded according to eddy-diffusivity (high values correspond to red, low values correspond to cyan). Since particles were released only once from the sources, and simultaneously, the logarithmic velocity profile is shown as a time surface. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows path lines of particles released from two sources at the inlet: the first is located slightly above the center, while the other is positioned in a comer. For the latter the perturbations are significantly smaller due to lower turbulence intensity near the bottom and wall of the channel. This can also be seen from the colour-coding of the path lines.</p><p>In figure 4 four frames from an animation have been printed to show the fluid motion by the convection of particles. Sources were regularly spaced at the crosssection of the inlet. The particles are displayed as line segments to show the fluctuations on the uni-directional mean flow in the channel, and are again colour-coded according to eddy-diffusivity.</p><p>The actual animation is 100 time steps (or frames); the particle paths are pre-calculated by the particle tracer, and with these data the animation is generated by the particle renderer in real time, at about 20 frames/sec. The fluctuations are perceived as erratic particle motions, and the spatial variation of turbulent motion is clearly shown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions and future research</head><p>A method is described for direct visualization of dynamic effects in 3D turbulent flows using particle motion animation. The method is suitable for use in flow simulations with a statistical turbulence model. Unlike other turbulence visualization methods, the random motions inherent in turbulence are shown in direct relation to the motions of the mean flow. The random-walk perturbation is not just a visual effect, but is based on physical and statistical theory of turbulent flow.</p><p>The method catches two essential aspects of turbulence very well: dynamics and randomness. Other aspects, such as the rotational nature of the motions, are not shown.</p><p>Indeed, it is not our intention to visualize the microstructure of turbulent flow (eddies, hairpin vortices) with a high degree of realism. Our purpose is direct visualization of essential features of turbulent motion using a technique with a good foundation in fluid dynamics.</p><p>In section 5 it is shown that the random perturbations of particle motion introduce a time-dependent effect in animations from time-independent data. Although the current implementation is only suitable for timeindependent flow fields, the theory developed in section 3 is also valid for fully time-dependent data. Thus, the implementation can be adapted to support time-dependent mean velocity and eddy-diffusivity fields.</p><p>Experiments show that the animations are clear and easy to understand. Still, there are some possibilities that may further enhance the visual impression. The launching and motion of particles could be used to emphasize highly turbulent regions in a flow area. The lifetime of a particle could be dynamically adjusted to the local characteristics of the flow field. For example, the lifetime could be increased in areas of high turbulence, and reduced in areas of low turbulence, so that particles will tend to concentrate in turbulent areas. This can further be strengthened by dynamic launching of extra 'turbulent particles' from the existing particles in highly turbulent areas, resulting in a 'cascade effect'. Initial experiments with these effects have shown promising results.</p><p>improvements Of *is paper* we want to *ank <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> Reeves, W.T., Particle Systems: A Technique for Arthur Mynett of Delft Hydraulics for his continuous support and valuable comments, and Jack van Wijk of the Netherlands Energy Research Foundation ECN for his gratefully acknowledge the support from Delft Hydraulics for Andrea Hin's research.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Particle path integration in a non-turbulent flow (a), and in a turbulent flow (b); Xi is the particle position at time ti, U i is the mean velocity at Xi, U'i the random perturbation vector at Xi, and Ui the compound velocity from mean velocity and random perturbation at Xi.</figDesc></figure>
