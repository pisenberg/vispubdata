<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The Institute of Theoretical Fluid Mechanics of the German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR) in Gottingen is mainly concerned with the development and implementation of large codes for the numerical solution of fluid dynamics problems (CFD-codes). These codes are run on DLR's Cray YMP computer in Oberpfaffenhofen in Bavaria. Data is then transferred via a leased line to workstations of the institute. The distance of this link is about 400 miles.</p><p>Two different types of code are in use for solving today's aerodynamic problems. A variety of codes for various fluid dynamic problems are coded as finite difference or finite volume schemes. These codes deliver their data on structured or multi-blocked structured curvi-linear grids. A second group of codes is implemented as finite-element scheme. Such programs create unstructured data, that is data placed on triangle or tetrahedra shaped cells.</p><p>Presently, one main topic of interest from the fluid dynamic point of view is hypersonic flows. These are studies of the flow around re-entry vehicles or hypersonic transport-configurations as well as studies of components of such vehicles. Another main point of interest is the flow through engine intakes and nozzles. Such flows exhibit important compressibility ef-fects such as shock waves as well as time-dependent behaviour.</p><p>Unlike many other aerodynamic research facilities the Institute of Theoretical Fluid Mechanics is equipped with low priced SUN workstations rather than special high performance graphic hardware. In order to provide interactive visualization on these machines which lack sophisticated graphics hardware a special in-house graphic system called HIGHEND was developed <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>. Due to its dedication towards fluid dynamics and a modular architecture which allows early data reduction during the visualization process, this system offers a fast interactive response even with extremely large amounts of data as they typically result from fluid dynamics simulations.</p><p>Typical applications include the visualization of computational grids, scalar values from flow data, vector quantities from flow simulations using hedgehog plots, streamlines, streamribbons and streamsurfacea. However the modular structure easily allows to i m p k ment new data reduction and post-processing methods in order to enhance the system and customize it towards particular needs of aerodynamicists and their contemporary fields of research.</p><p>This system is also a platform for research work in the field of scientific visualization since it allows extensions in a very easy manner. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research</head><p>configurations are major problems tackled by recent aerodynamics research. Since these flows exhibit particular features such as shock waves and unsteady phenomena new post-processing and visualization techniques were required in order to be able to efficiently perform research on these fluid dynamics problems. In the literature such phenomena are usually displayed by means of colour coded scalar value. In such a caae rapid changes in colour denote strong gradients which accompany the shock waves within the flow field ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.  1)</ref>. Such visualization appears inadequate to deal with this data for various reasons:</p><p>Colour coding does not attract, attention toward regions of strong gradients which are represented by small fringes. However, these regions are the regions of interest.</p><p>Strong gradients are frequently caused by various other phenomena, such as expansions, which are not of the same interest in this context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Colour coding on selected slices gives only a limited impression of three-dimensional structures in the data.</head><p>A desirable measure to quantify the strength of the phenomena such as the strength of the shock can not be applied.</p><p>Therefore, a dedicated shock visualization tool was needed. In order to examine shock wavea in their phye ical context this tool needs to be integrated with existing state-of-the-art visualization techniques within a complex software environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Simulation of Unsteady Phenomena</head><p>In particular the flow within ducta and nozzlea of the propulsion system of hypersonic vehicles is studied using a CFD code which allows to calculate unsteady flow solutions. A natural way of visualizing such data is the use of animations. Because of processing speed of the hardware in use these animations cannot be created in real time. But even if hardware with more 80phisticated support for graphics would be in use, realtime animation of large data is limited. At the most, reduced data may be animated using a limited set of graphic techniques which are supported by hardware. In order to overcome these limitations commonly precomputed animation sequences are used. These animations may be replayed many times by the scientist for better analysis of the data. An early approach was to calculate such animations frame by frame and store them on a video tape <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>. Recent advances in software, originally developed for multi-media applications allowed to offer improved solutions for the animated visualization of numerical flow simulations. This system speeds up the process of producing video tapes like the one created for this conference as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Co-operative Data Processing</head><p>Europe's aerospace industry and research facilities presently prepare applications which will make U(K of future international broadband communications such as ATM links. Co-operative visualization is one of the applications expected to be run on such networks. While presently such systems are still in the state of development, DLR tries to gain early experiences which such technology due to the frequent involment in international projects in the field of aeronautics and aerospace.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Visualization of Shock Waves</head><p>Due to the modular structure of DLR's visualization system HIGHEND it was easily possible to incorporate new algorithms and techniques into the system. One extension being particular dedicated to numerical solutions of hypersonic flows is a new method to locate the position of shock waves in a field of flow data in three-dimensional space <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>.</p><p>The. technique allows to visualize even complex three-dimensional shock patterns. Shock wavea may be tracked down even towards their weak parts which (See color plates, p. CP-37.) <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Shock pattern near the canopy of a configuration designed according to the forebody geometry of the NASP vehicle.</p><p>extend far into the outer free flow. As a side effect the method allows to create very attractive images of hypersonic flow regimes one of which was selected for the SIGGRAPH'92 slide set <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. In order to be able to illustrate the technique to a broader audience a video was produced which summarizes the steps needed to locate and visualize shock patterns in hypersonic flows. A solution around the nose of a generic NASP configuration, much similar to early designs of the US-National Aerospace Plane, was used for that purpose <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>. In order to be able to easily create this animation the animated shock visualization was created using the commercial visualization package AVS [SI, which provides advanced support for the generation of scenes based on key-frames.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Visualizing Unsteady Phenomena</head><p>Today due to recent software development it is possible to perform a real-time play back of animations even on low end workstations such as a SUN IPX.</p><p>This software is based on SUN'S XIL imaging library system. XIL allows to compress animations and store them on disc. Due to the high compression it is possible to retrieve the images from disk a.t a rate of 25 frames per second and higher. Of course, the decompression which does not involve any special hardware makes use of frame to frame coherence.</p><p>Therefore, the decompression rate may in some cases drop below 25 frames per second if the contents of the images changes too rapidly. However, our experience shows that in general this does not occur in data visualization applications even if the visualization is quite complex. Since XIL unlike other compression methods does not introduce loss of image accuracy, this technique is very valuable for scientific visualization. Storing animations on analogue video tape is accompanied by a significant drop in quality. Using this new technology the full resolution of workstation screens becomes available for the animation. Due to the high compression rate even lengthy animations do not pose any problem. One animation created used about 20 MB of disc space for 3 minutes duration of full screen frames. If desired, the animation may still be recorded on video tapes.</p><p>A first animation created purely from computer generated images illustrating the transonic flow around a wing of a transport aircraft was'shown by Sun Microsystems during this year's CeBIT exibition in Hannover. This technique allows a real-time display even of fullscreen animations including audio. The method is nowadays applied to aerwlastic problems such aa oscillating wings aa well aa flows with time-dependent behaviour within steady configurations ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Co-operative Data Processing</head><p>For a feasibility study DLR's visualization system HIGHEND was equipped with features to allow cooperative working <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>. These features include a synchronous display of data on several workstations on the network, mechanisms to pass control of the input between scientists at remote locations, tele-pointers, video transmission and audio transmission to enhance human communication. Since the prototype system <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(See color plates, p, CP-37.)</ref> was based upon the modules of our visualization system a wide variety of visualization techniques is available for co-operative working. It became obvious that such a system would be a useful tool to enhance international co-operation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Future</head><p>The HIGHEND visualization software has proved to be an elegant easy to extend platform. Therefore, new algorithms dedicated toward the demands of aerospace research will frequently be integrated into the system. In the past the major efforts served the purpose of visualizing flow data from numerical simulations. Future work will now concentrate on data from experimental sources such as windtunnel test and optical measurement techniques. Besides the new data structures the fact that such data typically comes with experimental inaccuracies which have to be treated by the visualization poses a major challenge.</p><p>In spite of the upcoming digital media, such as CDvideo, analog video recording is expected to be around for a while in particular for educational purposes and conferences. A new low cost but still good quality video recording system has just been build up. This system will be improved in the future since the numerical simulation of time-dependent data plays an increasing role in aerodynamics.</p><p>International cooperation is expected to play a much more important role in the future. Therefore, several activities concentrate on the evolution of cooperative, distributed interactive visualization as well as the use of multi-media technology for the exchange of results.</p><p>Windtunnel control and data acquisition and visualization systems which allow to directly link the windtunnel facilities to the customer's site are a further goal for the future.</p><p>Unsteady Phenomena, Hjpersorzic Flows, atid Co-operative F l o~' Visiicr1i:atioii ill Aerospace Research, H.-G.
