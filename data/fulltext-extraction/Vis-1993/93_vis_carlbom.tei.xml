<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Two types of filters are used in volume reconstruction and visualization: lowpass filters and interpolation filters. Lowpass filters are needed to subsample and to scale images and volumes by factors less than unity. Interpolation filters are needed for resampling to compensate for geometric distortions introduced by scanners and to resample during registration of, for example, a sequence of serial sections. 1 Interpolation filters are also needed for volume rendering. In ray-casting, the ray usually passes between sampling points in the volume, and a slicing plane also usually passes between sampling points.</p><p>The accuracy of the lowpass and interpolation filters can significantly affect the quality of the output, and insufficient attention to good filter design may lead to undesirable visual artifacts. However, visual inspection of an image or a volume is only one criterion for determining the suitability of a filter. In fact, although a filter may yield visually acceptable results, it may cause problems in registration or in performing certain calculations on the resulting 3D model. These problems are particularly severe when a sequence of filters is applied to reconstruction and visualization of a 3D volume, where the error is compound.</p><p>Resampling is discussed in the computer graphics literature for texture mapping and image warping [lo, 23, 7, 26, 161 and for volume reconstruction and rendering <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">11</ref>, and much time is devoted to sampling theory in SIGGRAPH courses on volume visualization [21, 221. However, the accuracy of the resulting filters has not been given adequate at tent ion.</p><p>We describe a method for optimal digital filter design used in signal processing based on a weighted Chebyshev minimization scheme. We compare these optimal filters to a class of filters that have gained considerable attention, namely, piecewise cubic filters. While the latter filters are simpler than the former, we obtain better results with the optimal filters with only one additional filter coefficient. Furthermore, the optimal filters allow quantification of the approximation error. We also show how an increase in filter length and a judicious choice of filter parameters can improve on the filter accuracy. We end with both qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the filters for 2 D and 3D data. We limit the discussion to interpolation filters; similar results can be obtained for low-pass filters. For readers unfamiliar with sampling theory, the appendix contains some commonly used terms.

The magnitude response for this filter is better than for the previous two cubic filters <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2)</ref>, but at an additional reduction in phase performance. Of these three piecewise cubic filters, only the cubic B-spline has non-negative filter coefficients.</p><p>In the next section, we will see how we can improve upon both magnitude and phase response with only a small increase in computation. We will then make some quantitative and qualitative comparisons of the piecewise cubic filters and the new optimal filters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Optimal Filter Design</head><p>In this section, we explore a method for minimizing the maximum difference between the the actual frequency response of a filter and the desired frequency response over some band (or bands) of frequencies.

This becomes particularly important in applications where a number of filters are applied in sequence and the processing depends on an accurate signal reconstruction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Interpolation Filter</head><p>An interpolation filter is equivalent to a filter that shifts or delays a signal by a non-integer number of sampling periods; i.e., phase shifting in the frequency domain is equivalent to interpolation in the spatial domain.</p><p>If a signal eiZTut is delayed by r , then the delayed signal is of the form Thus the frequency response of the ideal shift filter is The Parks-McClellan algorithm was designed to handle symmetric and anti-symmetric filters only.

However, the resulting filter is neither symmetric nor anti-symmetric, so we rewrite the minimization problem as two separate minimization problems (assuming that the filter length L  is odd), one for the real and one for the imaginary part of the frequency response, as was done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref>: Note that there is a discontinuity in the ideal frequency response at U = 0.5, which does not allow a uniformly good approximation over the full band, and thus uo must be less than 0.5. We use weighting functions that give equal relative errors over the interval 0.0 5 U 5 uo (as was done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref>): the reciprocal of ICOS(~TUT)( for the real part and the reciprocal of I sin( 2~217) 1 for the imaginary part.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">IIE('11)ll = mu=W+ ( L --1 ) / 2 lhe(0) + 2 he(m)C0S(2TUm) -COS(27WT)1,</formula><p>We can vary two variables in the design: the filter length and the transition band length.

Similarly, a three-dimensional filter can be implemented as a cascade of three onedimensional filters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Some Examples</head><p>There are many examples in the image processing literature (e.g., [8]) of visual artifacts caused by ringing and aliasing. These artifacts are especially noticeable in images of man-made objects with sharp edges and areas of constant intensity. Ringing and aliasing are not always as easy to discern in empirical data, which has fine detail, and not very sharp edges or constant intensity areas. Furthermore, visual inspection is only one criterion for choosing a suitable filter. If accurate signal reconstruction is important, we must find more quantitative ways to compare the performance of the filters discussed in the previous sections to illustrate how a judicious choice of filters can affect image accuracy. Let us look a t some sequences of processing to gain both qualitative and quantitative appreciation of the difference a judicious choice of filters may have for registration. We start with a demonstration of invariant shifting:</p><p>1. Shift the image 0.2 pixels. 2. Shift the image 0.2 pixels. 3. Shift the image 0.3 pixels. 4. Shift the image 0.3 pixels. 5. Shift the image -1.0 pixels. 6. Subtract the original image from the shifted image and find the absolute value of the result.</p><p>If we had reconstructed the original images perfectly, the resulting image should contain all zeros; i.e., the shifted image and the original image would be identical. Why is this important? In biomedical imaging, for example, serial reconstruction of anatomical sections requires a series of resampling operations: to correct for distortions introduced by the scanner, to register adjoining sections, to reconstruct an isotropic volume, and to render the volume. If the resampling is poor (the shifted and the original image are not nearly identical), then the accumulated error could significantly effect the shape of the reconstructed volume.</p><p>First let us process a set of stamps depicting the coronation of King Gustav I11 of Sweden from an etch-ing by Czeslaw Slania. We first digitize the stamp at 300 dpi, lowpass filter it and subsample by two. The resulting image is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>(a). Next we shift this image as described above. In <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>(b)-(f)3 we see the result of the shifting sequence, using the stamp with the King's face and the bishop's robe in the stamp of coronation scene. The difference images (inverted for clarity) are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.</p><p>We notice considerable differences between the shifted images, (which manifests itself as different degrees of blurring), and also between the difference images. As expected from the frequency responses, the optimal filters perform better than the cubic filters. In particular, we notice the lines on the King's face and the bishop's robe in the images generated by the optimal filters. These lines are not artifacts of the filtering process, but details in the etching which are mostly lost by the cubic filters.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>, we illustrate in a different manner the result of the process described above, using a histogram. The horizontal axis represents the absolute value of the difference in densities in the shifted and original images. The vertical axis represents the number of occurrences of a difference of a particular value.</p><p>The second example shows the results of slicing a 3D volume of an embryo heart reconstructed from serial light microscopy. The slices are generated using two piecewise cubic interpolation filters ( ( B , C) = ( l , O ) , ( B , C) = <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(1/3,1/3)</ref>), and one optimal interpolation filter with seven coefficients. In <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>, we see that the cubic filters result in some degree of blur- ring. The optimal filter performs better; for example, it shows more detail in the interior of the ventricles and on the exterior of the heart.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Summary</head><p>We have described a method for designing interpolation filters for volume reconstruction and visualization using a weighted Chebyshev approximation. The optimal filters give a better performance than piecewise cubic filters, and also give a simple characterization of the approximation errors. This is particularly important in scientific applications where data fidelity is of great importance, and where quantification of the processing error is needed [2]. We have also given qualitative and quantitative examples of the performance of these filters supporting the developed theory.</p><p>There is, of course, no universally suitable interpolation filter for volume reconstruction and visualization. The appropriate filter is highly dependent on the characteristics of the data, the sampling rate, and the desired result. Filter design also requires tradeoffs between computational expense and accuracy. Undoubtedly, different filters must be used at different stages of processing. Despite the higher computing cost, longer filters are key to improved performance required for the demanding applications in volume reconstruction and visualization.</p><p>Signal: A signal is a oneor multi-dimensional function of space or time. For our purposes, a 2D signal is an image while a 3D signal is a volume. In the frequency domain, a signal can be expressed as a sum of a sequence of sinusoids of different frequencies eianun, where U is the frequency, and n is the spatial variable. A signal is transformed from the spatial domain to the frequency domain by a Fourier transform. In this appendix, we define our terms for the 1D case only. All concepts and terms have obvious 2D and 3D counterparts. Bandlimited signal: A signal is said to have bandwidth um if it has no frequency components outside the interval -U, 5 U 5 U,,,. Most optical imaging systems produce an analog spatially bandlimited signal. Nyquist rate: The Nyquist rate of a signal is twice its bandwidth. The Sampling Theorem: If a signal is bandlimited, and if it is sampled on an infinite interval at a rate higher than the Nyquist rate, then the continuous signal can be exactly recovered from the samples through appropriate interpolation. In this paper, we consider signals to have a bandwidth of 1/2, which gives rise to a Nyquist rate of one, or equivalently, we use a non-dimensional frequency in units of cycles per pixel. Discrete impulse: A discrete impulse, or the unit sample sequence, 6(n) is defined by 0, otherwise.</p><p>Filter: A filter is a system that maps an input signal f ( n ) to an output signal, or response, g ( n ) . When a filter is applied to b(n), the result is called the filter impulse response. If the input to a filter is the complex sinusoid ei2*un, then the output of the filter is the same sinusoid, multiplied by the complex filter frequency response. We use the filter frequency magnitude response and phase response as criteria for filter design. Aliasing: Aliasing manifests itself as artifacts in the sampled or subsampled signal, (e.g., jagged edges). Aliasing occurs if a signal is not bandlimited or is not sampled above the Nyquist rate. It may also occur when a sampled signal is subsampled, since the sampling periods may overlap in the frequency domain and high frequencies may appear as lower frequencies in the subsampled signal. Ringing: Ringing is a "rippling" effect around sharp transitions in the sampled signal. It is the result of negative filter coefficients; non-negative filter coefficients avoid all ringing. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Parks-McClellan algorithm [15].
