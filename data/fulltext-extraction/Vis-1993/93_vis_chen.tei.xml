<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Supercomputing-Visualization Environment</head><p>The Supercomputer Group of Fujitsu America, Inc. was established in 1991 to support scientists and engineers in solving computational intensive problems and data visualization. This group has a supercomputingvisualization facility located at San Jose, California. The facility includes: a Fujitsu vector-processing supercomputer VPX240, a SUN workstation for general purpose, a SGI IRIS VGX workstation for visualization, a Kodak color printer, a Versatec oversize printer, a Sony U-matic tape recorder, a Sony Laser Videodsc recorder, a Focus film recorder, and an IOPNER scanner.</p><p>The supercomputer, workstations, terminals as well as video and graphics input/output devices are connected by Ethernet and Ultranet networking systems, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Users can access the supercomputer and workstations through network-connected terminals or workstations, and they can execute computer jobs at the facility site or at remote locations. The video equipment and graphics workstations are in a visualization laboratory at the facility for a user to conduct a visualization session.</p><p>The visualization software systems include: AVS of Advanced Visual System, Inc., Explorer of Silicon Graphics, Inc., Data Visualization of Wave Front, Inc., Flow Analysis Tool Kit (FAST) of NASA. AVS and FAST are the most frequently used systems at the facility.</p><p>AVS, like other data flow visualization systems, consists of modules which can be selected and connected by the AVS Network Editor to build a visualization application[ 11. Modules are supplied by AVS or they can be written by users. Therefore, this is an open visualization system which can be expanded by the user. It is run on X-window graphics workstations.</p><p>FAST is a software environment consisting of modules for visualizing scalar and vector fields pertaining to computational fluid dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. FAST is basically a closed system with fixed amounts of available modules. Important modules are: File-IO for handling inputloutput data; Surfer for generating contours and vectors on designated cross-sections; Isolev for generating isosurfaces of a scalar field; and Tracer for generating streamlines. Users may add user-developed modules to FAST. However, adding modules requires compiling codes and building an executable binary file. It is run on Silicon Graphics workstations only.</p><p>In this study, applications of AVS will be discussed in detail, while FAST system will be mentioned only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Climate Simulation Model</head><p>In this study, the Community Climate Model (CCM) is used for generating time-dependent meteorological data. This model has been developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research, USA (NCAR). It has been used for studying long-term climate variations. The model has been coded in Fortran, and has been running on CRAY supercomputers.  CCMl uses global meteorological and oceanographic observation data as input, and is capable of producing weather data on designated output intervals. At each output interval, the model produces forecast data including: temperature, wind velocity, water vapor specific humidity, surface pressure, precipitation, etc.</p><p>The CCM version 1 (CCMl) is used in this study. CCMl was implemented on the Fujitsu's supercomputer VPX240 in February 1993 at San Jose, and became operational in March, 1993.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Case Study Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Model Run and Data Generation</head><p>As a test run, CCMl was used to generate a month's output data with 1488 time step outputs. The output data currently being investigated include: three-dimensional temperature (T), wind velocity (u.v.~), and specific humidity <ref type="bibr">((1)</ref>. These data were written into files using the NASA PLOT3D function data format. These files are used as input files for the AVS and FAST visualization systems.</p><p>The files were stored in the VPX240 disc storage device, and they were made available to graphics workstations through the remote-mounting utility provided by the Network File Server (NFS); no data transfer from the supercomputer to the workstations is necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Model Output Data Format</head><p>A field file, a type of AVS input file, is created by using a PLOT3D grid file and PLOT3D function files.</p><p>As described in AVS User's Guide <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>, an AVS field file can be an ASCII descriptive file containing instructions for inputting the coordinates and vector data. Therefore, these PLOT3D files, created for FAST runs, need no reformatting or re-processing for AVS runs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Data Visualization Examples</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="23.1">Scalar Field Visualization</head><p>As a visualization example session in this case study, an AVS network as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, was constructed for visualizing air temperature in a spherical coordinate system. The network includes: Read Field--a module for reading in 3-dimensional temperature data and grid point coordinates; Volume Bound--a module for showing the limits of physical domain; Isosurface--a module for showing an equal temperature surface; three Orthogonal Slicers--three modules connecting a color map module and three cross-sectional modules for showing a spherical surface (slice) with longitudinal and latitudinal slices; and Geometry Viewer--a view module for displaying graphical objects produced by connecting modules. This AVS network is functionally equivalent to the Surfer module of FAST.</p><p>Graphics examples produced by this AVS network are shown in Plate 1. The color ring surrounding the equator is a slice produced by one of the Orthogonal Slicer modules. The color half-ring along a longitude is a slice produced by another Orthogonal Slicer module. The global surface showing lanaocean outlines is produced by yet another Orthogonal Slicer module. The pink patch encompassing the equatorial region, a 273 K degree isosurface, is produced by the Isosurface module. These graphics objects can be changed interactively, and they are used for examining temperature distributions.</p><p>Graphics examples produced by the FAST Surfer and Isolev modules are shown in Plate 2. The red transparent isosurface of 273 K degree, created by the Isolev module, is shown for comparing to that of Plate 1. The North and South American continental outlines are generated by a Surfer module. The equatorial slice (ring) and a longitudinal slice (half-ring) are created by Surfer modules. A color legend showing color contour values is generated by FASTS legend module.</p><p>Many other AVS networks can be developed for examining meteorological data. As an example, a network similar to the temperature analysis network can be used for analyzing specific humidity. In fact, a specific humidity network was created by modifying the temperature network.</p><p>An AVS graphics output example for specific humidity is shown in Plate 3. The color contours on the global surface are shown in dark blue depicting a low humidity region and red depicting a high humidity region. A semi-transparent white patch encompassing the equatorial region is an isosurface for 10 g/kg specific humidity.</p><p>Similar to AVS, FAST modules can be used for visualizing different scalar fields. The specific humidity graphics output generated by Surfer modules are shown in Plate 4. A equatorial slice (ring), a longitudinal slice (half-ring), and earth surface contour map (sliced surface) are created by three separate Surfer modules. A color contour value legend is shown on the left of Plate 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Vector Field Visualization</head><p>An example for showing an AVS network can be made of analyzing a vector field--velocity. To begin with, a velocity vector field file is made by combining three velocity component (U, v, w) files. This field file is read by a Read Field module. A Hedge Hog module is connected to the Read Field module to produce velocity arrows, and a Streamline module also connected to the Read Field module to produce streamlines. A display module is then connected to the Hedge Hog and Streamline modules to display vector arrows and streamlines. The resulting graphics are shown in Plate 5. The space coordinate system used in this example is Cartesian, because the Hedge Hog module works only with Cartesian coordinate system.</p><p>The FAST Surfer module provides the capability to display vector arrows in any coordinate system. The spherical coordinate system is used in Plate 6 to show wind vectors at the top of the atmosphere. A contour analysis of kinetic energy depicted in m2/sec is superimposed in Plate 6. It is possible to generate streamlines using the Tracer module of FAST. However, it is not shown in Plate 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.33">Animation</head><p>It is difficult to show an animation with static pictures. However, at the Vision 93 conference a video tape will be used to show some realtime visualization segments using the AVS and FAST animation capabilities.</p><p>AVS is capable of showing isosurface animation. This capability is very good for examining a scalar field time evolution (such as temperature, moisture content, pressure, cloud amount, etc.) It is also capable of showing streamline animation with time-freeze.</p><p>FAST is capable of showing streamline animation with time-freeze. It does not have good realtime capability in showing scalar field time evolution. For a scalar field time evolution visualization, FAST has to rely on frame-by-frame video recording.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Other Visualization Application--Model Validation Using Visualization Techniques</head><p>A CCMl model has recently been installed in Fujitsu's VPX240 supercomputer. It has been under a validation process where numerical simulation results have been checked with known results. However, the model output data are enormous. Eyeing numerical data with text prints can very quickly overwhelm a researcher. Therefore data visualization with graphical output is a better choice for an overall validation.</p><p>For example, a field data comparison network can be made to compare a current model output with a stored (standard) output. The difference can actually be viewed graphically. The use of the difference network is conducted for the CCMl validation. The visual validation of model results was very helpful for the program debugging and implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Comparisons of Visualization Software Systems</head><p>For visualizing output data, FAST and AVS have been used inter-changeably. FAST was originally developed for computational fluid dynamics, and it is a natural candidate for climate study. AVS is a general purpose visualization software system, and it has been used for weather studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. The pro and cons of these two software systems are listed as follows:</p><p>In terms of overall execution speed, both software systems do quite well with the SGI 4D VGX as a visualization workstation. FAST requires a longer initialization time. Interactive respond time is about equal for both systems. When using software rendering, AVS becomes almost non-interactive. The same problem occurs for FAST when an anti-alias mode is used.</p><p>In terms of graphics feature quality, FAST Seems to do a better job. FAST can generate an annotated color contour legend (Plates 2,4, 6), while the current (fourth) version of AVS cannot. FAST can do two-dimensional title fairly easily, while AVS can only use a labeling feature to produce very small texts (Plates 1,3,5).</p><p>In terms of software expandability AVS is better. The AVS Network Editor can emulate FAST modules, while FAST can only be expanded by adding modules produced by programming in high-level languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Future Plan</head><p>As for a future plan, this case study will extend to include:</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Hardware Architecture the spectral method with Fast Fourier Transform algorithms to solve dynamic meteorological governing equations prescribing the time rate of change of momentum, heat, moisture, etc. [31</figDesc></figure>
