				<p>The features of greatest interest in ocean modeling in the Gulfof Mexico and along the Gulfstream are the fronts and eddies. Resolving, modeling, and tracking these eddies over time is of great importance for climatological studies and economic advancement. In this paper we present a novel technique for automatically locating, contouring, and tracking oceanic features such as eddies and fronts. The models and resultant visualizations exhibit excellent correlation with observed data. I. Overview of domain Ocean modeling seeks to more accurately predict climatological events such as droughts, temperature extremes. storm paths, etc., as well as resolve oceanographic features such as fronts and eddies. Both goals have economic ramifications, in that they are useful for preparing for severe weather, safe staffiig of oil rigs, routing of ships along the safest path, fmding more and larger fish [71. and creating long term weather forecasts. These featum, e.g. eddies, have traditionally been ascertained by experienced oceanographers. who deduced these time-varying features from satellite imagery and in situ observations. If the weather umditim were cloudy, often no usable satellite image data d d be obtained. All</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. Problem introduction</head><p>A vast volume of data is generated from either simulations or observations of mesoscale ocean processes. Gigabyte data sets are common 111. Sampling resolutions vary; most of the data which we have visualized is sampled at a 5-10 minute resolution. Mesoscale phenomena, such as eddies and fronts. affect each other in their creation, evolution, and elimination, depending on their relative spatial and temporal locations and may persist for hours or years.</p><p>In order t o capture the combinational effects of multiple processes, data sets usually include multiple parameters, such as temperature, pressure, salinity, sea-surface height, and velocity. E.g.. an eddy can be detected via temperature as a mass of ocean water with a distinct temperature or via its circular flow. The systematic investigation of ocean behavior requires collecting and tracking data for many years.</p><p>Tracking eddies is also difficult. since one eddy may split into smaller eddies, two eddies may merge to form one eddy, or an eddy may remain relatively static for awhile and then dissipate itself. Whenever possible, ocean modelers compare the results derived from their simulations with experimental data acquired from airb&lt;xne sensors or in situ observations to validate their models. They also use observed data to drive their models.</p><p>Feature-extraction allows the user to effectively distinguish the desired portion of a large data volume from the less interesting. The features that may not be apparent othemise can be viewed directly. However. the data classification in the feature-extraction process requires the user to be familiar with the characteristics of the data volumes to be rendered. It may take extensive, time-consuming searches before a novice extracts the desired f e a w s . This problem is exacerbated in rendering large 4D, multi-parameter data sets. To relieve the user of the burden of data classification so as to render a large dataset most effectively, some sort of tool is desired.</p><p>Features with the greatest dynamic changes are usually the ones of most interest to the user. In other words, a feature may be best profiled by its changing edges. For instance, an eddy is defined as a part of the ocean with significantly higher or lower temperatures than the surraunding area. Therefore, the eddy can best be tracked by finding the temperature contrasts in the volume instead of the temperature itself.</p><p>The process of generating featwe surfaces includes four major steps. It begins with the user choosing a data classification. Secondly, all values in the data volume are classified. Then those points in the class are connected by a contourannecting algorithm, which generates a sequence of rendering primitives such as polygons or lines. Finally, various rendering methods can be applied to these primitives to let the user visualize those values. If the user changes the viewing parameters, only the last step needs to be repeated.</p><p>The most difficult step in the process is the data classifcation [21. An inappropriate classification may fail to extract the desired feature(s). A simple example is that if the threshold entered by the user is outside the range of values, the matching search will fail and lead to a blank image. This is especially problematic for data sets containing temporally varying volumes spanning seasons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>N. Method</head><p>A typical feature is an eddy. The shape of an eddy is best Characterized by its edge profile. not its absolute temperature. Using a traditional isosurface generation function, the user can only extract dynamic featms in an indirect way.</p><p>In this paper, we present an approach to alleviate the burden caused by the data classification problem and thus speed up the feature extraction procedure. The approach utilizes a 3D gradient operator which was first presented in [31 for edge detection in CT imagery and operated on unit-spaced grids. We extend the edge operator to allow for irregular grid intervals and use it for four-dimensional gridded data sets. It is applicable to a 3D data volume defined on Cartesian grids and allows irregular grid intervals in one direction. A fully irregular rectilinear grid would involve much more computation to account for the grid interval varia-tions. Fartunately. most oceanographic gridded data has regular grid intervals along the x (longitude) and y (latitude) directions, and irregular grid intervals along the z (ocean depth) direction. The edge operator is used as a pre-filter to detect dynamic changes within a data volume. The output is then fed into an isosurface generation routine. The case study indicates the use of the edge operator efficiently speeds up the visualization process and increases the usability of the feam-extraction function.</p><p>Suppose thatf(t,x,y,z) is a scalar function value at the grid point (x,y,z) at time step f. The algorithm starts by applying a difference formula to each grid point and its corresponding points in the temporally adjacent volumes and takes the larger one to test against the temporal threshold, TH,: <ref type="figure">ti+~,x,y.z)f(fi,x,y.z)l, r(f(ri.x.y,z) -f ( t i -, . x , y , z</ref>  For all points which pass the temporal threshold test, the 3D edge operator is used to compute the three Cartesian gradients and the amplitude of their vector sum. The grid point with the m a x i " composite gradient amplitude is considered to have the greatest dynamic changes with respect to both time and space. Therefare, the region around this point is most likely to constitute an oceanographic feahm.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Mu~flf(</formula><p>The 3D edge operator can be easily derived by considering a 3~3x3 data block with the point to be evaluated at the center. Since within a data volume the time step is constant, we can express the function value as@,y,z). Then the function values in the 3x3~3 block can be written as {f(xi,yj,zk),  Due to the irregular grid intervals, most of computational effort is in calculating the dot products in Equations (2). (3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>i, j , k E[U,Z,2]). Let (Z,Z,Z)</head><p>and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. Since the 3 x 3~3 block is defined on a Cartesian grid, the dot products become the triangular projections to the three orthogonal axes, but this involves square root operations. For irregular intervals in all three directions, that means 16x3 square root operations for each direction for each grid point. Fortunately, most oceanographic datasets have constant grid intervals in the x (longitude) and y (latitude) directions, which eliminates two thirds of the computations. Thus if we denote the constant grid interval along the x-axis and y-axis as a and b, respectively, c2 = a2 + b2 is a constant. Denoting the variable grid interval along the z-axis as z, the dot products from an adjacent comer point to the three gradient directions are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">a dc2 + 22 ' J L -2 ' J-.</formula><p>To further simplify the computation, the square root function is approximated by a second order Taylor's expansion: Thus the final edge operator obtained is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>, where and z2 m the (positive) distances representing the two grid intervals along the z-axis.</p><p>Note, a, b, and c are constants; only zo and 22 are variables. However, the whole computation can be done slice by slice along the z direction for a data volume and for each slice ~0 and 22 will remain unchanged. Therefore, all the coefficients in the edge operator need be computed only once for each slice. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. Results</head><p>The edge operator was used in a case study of oceanographic visualization, the primary objective of which was to analyze dynamic subsurface structures of ocean mesoscale features like eddies and to track feature movements.</p><p>The image shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> is a 2D horizontal cutting plane of ocean temperature in the Gulf of Mexico. The dataset has a dimension of 11~83~60x20, e.g., 11 temporal realizations, 83 longitude (x) samples, 60 latitude (y) samples, and 20 depth (z) samples. The sampling resolution in the longitude and latitude directions are fixed, while the sampling intervals vary along the ocean depth. The color map is overlaid on <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. The contour lines shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> were automatically extracted by using the edge operator we developed. It clearly illustrates the horizontal cross-sections of two eddies. The coastline was eliminated by the temporal filter; otherwise, it would exhibit the maximum edge amplitude.</p><p>It should be noted that the edge operator is not intended to enhance the contour generation function itself. but to automatically find and track the most likely features of interest in a large dataset. The important achievement is the efficiency that is not revealed by the static images. The contour line images are generated automatically. The only parameter the user may want to adjust is the offset of the contour value range and the number of contours. The offset lets the user choose to draw the contour lines on either, neither, or both sides of the feature. Both of these parameters are independent of the function values and can be adjusted easily with a slider. Another advantage of using the edge operator is in the animation process. Since dynamic features are often recognized by their relative amplitudes, their actual values may change with time and space. Far instance, the temperature inside an eddy changes along the ocean depth. To best visualize and track such dynamic features, it is often desirable to have an optimized data classifkation for each volume or slice during the animation process. The use of the edge operator provides such a means. The images shown in <ref type="figure">Figures  5 and 6</ref> are the color-filled cutting planes and the colorcoded contours at four Herent depths, respectively. It can be seen that the function values (temperature) inside the eddies decrease as the depth increases, illustrated by the colors of the contour lines, while the eddy perimeters remain unchanged. That means an optimized feature extraction can be achieved in an animation independent of whether the feature changes its function values with time or space. Without the edge operator, the user has to adjust the data classification to a global optimization, or use a broader threshold range that may reduce the feature contrast. <ref type="figure">Figure  7</ref> shows part of a temporal animation of the contours at a fixed depth, which were automatically visualized using the edge operator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. Conclusions and future work</head><p>The use of the edge operator approach for the feature extraction visualization proved to be very helpful and efficient. It greatly reduces the data classification task. Features can be automatically tracked. The user need not be familiar with the datasets to be visualized, which is highly desirable in a large-volume. multi-parameter data environment and in an operational environment. With the edge operator approach. animation of the feature-extracted images can be easily performed. Data classifcation is optimized at each animating step, therefore, a more precise feature extraction is achieved.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>)~ 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>TH,This step is used to eliminate the time-invariant edges such ascoasdines.</figDesc></figure>
