				<p>New display technologies have begun to provide more innovative and potentially powerful methods to present information to a viewer. However, many of these techniques struggle to deliver accurate full color. In this paper, we address this dificulty by employing the dichromatic theory of color reflection, which implies that many objects can be rendered accurately using only two primaries. Complex display systems with two primaries can be produced with significantly less work than is required for the traditional three primaries. W e discuss methods f o r selecting objects that can be rendered accurately on two-color displays, and we present our experiments with a two-color display using monochromatic primaries.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The workhorse for scientific visualization display is the color CRT. While this display will remain the primary image output medium for quite some time, current research is bringing other powerful display techniques within reach. One trend is the move from strictly two-dimensional presentation t o three-dimensional presentation; the addition of strong depth and motion cues greatly increases the ability to present information. Consequently, stereoscopic displays [l] and head or boom mounted displays [2] are becoming widespread. In addition, the same motivation has led to other novel display technologies. Two examples that seem particularly promising for visualization are true three-dimensional volume displays In this paper, we discuss the possibility of using only two primary colors for image display rather than the usual three colors. The use of two colors to relieve technical difficulties is not new; it is employed in penetration tube technology [lo] and has been suggested for low cost liquid crystal displays (111. The two-color reconstructions studied by <ref type="bibr">Land [12]</ref> have also prompted an appreciable amount of research in perceptual psychology for display applications.</p><p>Here, however, we provide a physically based motivation for the use of two colors that stems from the dichromatic theory of color reflection [13] [14]. This theory suggests that, for many surfaces, the reflection of a single spectral power distribution from a surface contains only two color components, independent of the lighting and viewing geometry. Consequently, an object that satisfies this criterion can be rendered accurately on a display with only two primaries. While this condition may be valuable for natural images, it is particularly useful in computer-generated imagery, where surface and light properties can be chosen freely.</p><p>We begin in Section 2 with a brief introduction to the aspects of color perception relevant t o display applications, and we continue in Section 3 with a discussion of the dichromatic theory of reflection. In Section 4, we describe image synthesis techniques for accurate color reproduction on two-color displays, and we present a simulation of a two-color display with monochromatic primaries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Overview of Color Perception</head><p>The key principles of color perception that must be considered for display systems are contained in the color-matching experiments (Wyszecki and Stiles (151 provide a full discussion of the ideas presented in this section). In these experiments, observers are able to match any color with an additive mixture of three spectrally independent light sources. By experimentally determining the intensities of three light sources needed to qatch the spectral colors, one can obtain color-matching functions. In 1931, the CIE proposed a set of standard color-matching functions, z(X), g(X), and ,%(A), from which the tristimulus values, X Y Z , of a spectral power distribution, E(A), are computed with</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x = J,b(X)E(X)dX z = j A Z ( X ) E ( X ) d X .</formula><p>Every spatially uniform spectral power distribution with the same tristimulus values appears the same color. Assuming that this equivalence holds on a pixelby-pixel basis, it can be used for accurate color reproduction, leading directly to the use of three primaries in color displays.</p><p>A common representation for color work is the twodimensional chromaticity diagram. The chromaticity coordinates, (2, y), of a spectral power distribution with tristimulus values X Y Z are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X X + Y + Z x = V I (2) X + Y + Z ' Y =</formula><p>Geometrically, these chromaticities are obtained by extending a ray from the origin of tristimulus space through the point ( X , Y, 2 ) until the ray intersects the plane X + Y + Z = 1. Orthographically projecting this intersection point onto the X Y plane yields the chromaticity coordinates. The chromaticity diagram is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The displayable colors fall within the solid, closed contour; the curved portion of this contour is the spectrum locus, where monochromatic sources fall, and the line of purples joins the two ends of the spectrum locus.</p><p>In the chromaticity diagram, the additive mixture of two spectral power distributions lies on the straight line segment joining their respective chromaticity coordinates. Therefore, a display with two primaries produces colors that lie on the line segment joining the chromaticities of the primaries. As an example, the gamut of colors that can be produced with two monochromatic sources a t 488nm and 633nm is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. By extension, a three-color display produces colors that lie within the triangle whose vertices are the chromaticities of the display primaries. ure 1 also includes the gamut of colors for the R G B monitor we use here for color computation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RGB Color Space</head><p>In this paper, we utilize R G B color space, which is the space of reproducible colors for a given R G B display. If the spectral power distributions of the primaries of this display are given by .(A), g ( X ) , and b(X), and the display is properly gamma corrected [16], the spectral power distribution of a pixel with values R, G , and B is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">c(X) = &amp;(A) + Gg(X) + Bb(X).</formula><p>( <ref type="formula">3)</ref>The tristimulus values, X Y Z , of .(A) are computed from Equation 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">x = R X , + G X , + B X b Y = R Y , + G Y g + B Y b (4) Z R Z , + G Z , + B Z b .</formula><p>In matrix form, these equations can be written</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(:)=(; X T xg 2 Xb ;)(;). (5)</formula><p>Assuming this transformation is invertible, for each set of tristimulus values, one can compute the required intensities R, G , and B to accurately reproduce the color on the R G B display. Therefore, given a spectral power distribution, one can compute its tristimulus values from Equation 1 and use the inverse of Equation 5 to obtain its R G B equivalent. Some spectral power distributions may have R G B values that can not be displayed because they are either negative or too large. The gamut-mapping problem is important, but for the purposes of our discussion, we assume that the colors t o be shown fall within the display gamut. Consequently, we can associate a vector in R G B color </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Dichromatic Theory of Reflection</head><p>Understanding color reflection is important for visualization because lighting and shading cues are an integral part of three-dimensional data display. Shading cues are often applied t o volume data but are particularly useful when images contain surfaces. In these cases, each surface is assigned surface reflectance properties and is illuminated by a single light or a set of lights.</p><p>The dichromatic theory of color reflection can be employed t o describe this illumination process. It suggests that the reflection of light from a single surface under a single spectral power distribution (one light source or a set of identical light sources) often contains only two color components, independent of the lighting and viewing geometry [13][14]. The two components, diffuse and specular, arise from distinct physical processes that are depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>. The specular component is light that is reflected from the surface interface without significant interaction with the material. Consequently, this component is typically the color of the illuminant. The diffuse component is light that penetrates the material and is scattered below the surface multiple times before exiting. This light is selectively absorbed by colorant particles within the material, thereby taking on its color. The validity of this model has been experimentally demonstrated for many objects [17]; however, certain classes of objects, most notably metals, have different reflection properties.</p><p>Often, an isotropic ambient lighting term is included in reflection models, to account for light that is spread diffusely through the environment. Thus, if the reflection is dichromatic, the spectral power distribution, where k d ( R ) and ks(R) are constants that depend on the lighting and viewing geometry, R, and E,(X),Ed(X), and E,(X) are the spectral power distributions of the ambient, diffuse, and specular components, respectively. In many images, the dominant contributions to the spectral power distribution reaching the viewer come from the initial reflection of the light source from the surfaces in a scene. In this paper, we assume that we can neglect contributions from light that has been multiply reflected in the scene. For synthetic images this assumption is frequently accurate; however, for natural scenes the interreflections may be too large to ignore.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Color Space Representation</head><p>From Equation 6 , we can express the reflected spectral power distribution of Equation 7 as a vector in R G B color space c'= c',</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">+ kd(O)&amp; + k s ( f l ) l ? s ,<label>( 8 )</label></formula><p>where Za,&amp;, and c', are the color vectors of the ambient , diffuse, and specular components, respectively. This equation gives the possible distribution of the light reflected from a surface under a set of identical lights; the distribution is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>. The diffuse and specular vectors define a parallelogram of possible color values, which is shifted from the origin by the ambient vector. Therefore, all of the color values lie on a plane in color space; this plane passes through the origin when the ambient vector is a linear combination of the diffuse and specular vectors. </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">..... , . . . . y . . . . . . , , , , I - Pixel Values ,_...'"</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Empirical Lighting Models</head><p>The computational problem of lighting and shading is very complex and is accompanied by an extensive literature [18]. However, several useful empirical lighting models are common in computer graphics. Most of these models follow the dichromatic theory of color reflection, dividing reflected light into separable diffuse and specular terms.</p><p>One model of particular importance is the RGB model used in most computer graphics hardware and in many rendering systems. This model characterizes the lights and surface components as RGB triples, and reflection takes the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">CZ = SiL; + kd(R)S6Li + k,(n)S;L' i = R , G, B,(9)</formula><p>where kd(R) and ks(R) are factors that depend only on geometry, and L and La are the spectral power of the light source and ambient light, respectively. In this model, the surface is characterized by an ambient, Sa, a diffuse, Sd, and a specular reflectance, S,. All of these terms have red, green, and blue components. This model is also dichromatic, so surfaces that are rendered with it have pixel values that fall within a parallelogram in color space.</p><p>An example of this result is given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 5</ref>, which shows a n isosurface from a smoke-seeded fluid flow. The surface was extracted with the marching cubes algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[19]</ref> and rendered with the RGB lighting model of a Silicon Graphics Indigo XS24 graphics computer. T h e pixel values within the red rectangle are plotted in RGB color space to the right of the isosurface; these values are coplanar.</p><p>The planar structure in color space arising from dichromatic reflection is used in the field of machine vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[20]</ref>. In this section, we suggest its use in color analysis of synthetic images. As one example, we show that if surfaces in a n image are accurately described with a dichromatic representation, color information in that image can be manipulated while preserving shading information. This ability may prove useful if the full three-dimensional information in a scene is unavailable or is expensive to compute.</p><p>Coplanarity of color values can be used to identify a single surface in a n image. For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 5 ,</ref> we fit a plane in color space to pixels from the selected region, and we use a flood-filling algorithm [21] based on the criterion that the color of a n accepted point lies within some tolerance of this plane. This method selects the connected points in the image that lie on the outside of the surface, without knowledge of the three-dimensional information.</p><p>Given a selected surface, one can modify its color while preserving the colors of the other surfaces in the image. This color change can be implemented without This transformation results in a set of color values that still obeys the dichromatic theory and preserves the shading information. Since the specular highlights are typically the color of the light source, the transformation should give Zi = kc',, which implies that 3 , should be an eigenvector of T . This type of color transformation is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 6</ref> , where the color of only the outer surface in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 5</ref> is changed while preserving its shading. Note that this action is taken on the image, not the three-dimensional data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Two-Color Displays</head><p>In this section, we turn our discussion to the application of the dichromatic theory to image synthesis and analysis for two-color displays. If a display system is very complicated, two primaries might be much more readily implemented than three. Or, if a display will show only a single object or a small number of objects (a situation frequently encountered in holography), two colors are often sufficient.</p><p>A two-color display consists of a pair of primaries with spectral power distributions given by Pl(X) and &amp;(A). Consequently, a pixel in the display has a spectral power distribution, P(A), given by</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>P(X) = C l P l ( A ) + C Z P Z ( A ) .</head><p>(12)</p><p>Using Equation 6, we can express P(X) as a color vector, Z, in terms of color vectors of the two primaries, pi and I%, This color vector lies in a parallelogram in color space defined by the vectors of the primaries. The discussion in Section 3 implies that if one wishes to visualize a single dichromatic surface under a set of identical lights, this display can be sufficient. Both the display and the surface have pixel values that fall on parallelograms in color space; if the parallelogram from the display fully contains that from the surface, the display can accurately reproduce the surface.</p><p>In principle, if one is given a surface under a set of identical lights, two primaries can be selected t o reproduce it. However, the more common situation is when one is given the display primaries and must generate images that are accurately rendered. This task consists of two distinct operations, image synthesis and the computation of color-separation images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Image Synthesis</head><p>z= Clpi + c2&amp;. <ref type="bibr">(13)</ref> To synthesize an image that is accurately displayed with only two primaries, one must ensure that all of the pixel values in the image lie within the parallelogram of color values that the primaries can reproduce. Therefore, the choice of primaries constrains the surfaces and lights that can be used in a scene.</p><p>The first constraint is placed on the selection of light sources. Any number of light sources can be used in a scene, but all of the light sources must have the same spectral power distribution t o guarantee that the color information coming from any point on a surface is dichromatic.</p><p>However, the major constraints fall on the selection of surface properties. These properties need t o be chosen such that the reflection of the light from every surface in the scene yields color values that fall in the gamut of the two primaries. If all surfaces are chosen to obey the dichromatic theory, the reflection from a  We can ensure that this color will fall within the gamut of the two-color display by choosing the ambient, diffuse, and specular components t o be linearly dependent on pi and &amp;, the color vectors of the two primaries: By comparison with Equation 13, these color values can be displayed accurately on the two-color display when the coefficients are chosen such that they yield non-negative amounts of the two primaries. If this selection is performed for all of the surfaces within a given scene, the entire image can be reproduced with the two primaries.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Za = a l p i + a&amp;</formula><p>For the RGB lighting model, Equation 9, the most straightforward way of generating appropriate images is to take the color vectors of the ambient light and the directional light as white ( l , l , l ) . Selecting the ambient , diffuse, and specular reflectance components so they obey Equations 15-17 will result in images that can be correctly reproduced on the two-color display. We used this technique t o generate images on a Silicon Graphics Indigo XS24 graphics workstation. We selected the specular reflectance of all surfaces t o be close to neutral to obtain highlights that are nearly white. T h e pixel values of the images fall within the gamut of the two monochromatic primaries, 488nm and 633nm, shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Because the gamut of the CRT can not achieve colors as saturated as the spectral lines, we limit the surface colors to those that fall within the CRT gamut; these limits are given by the open circles in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 7</ref> depicts several spheres, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 8</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 9</ref> show applications in visualization. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 8</ref> shows a compound that is used to model some of the electronic properties of an analogous polyimide; the white atoms are hydrogen, the grayish atoms are carbon, the red atoms are oxygen, and the blue atoms are nitrogen.

The computation of the color separations then reduces t o If the shading information for each pixel is preserved during the rendering procedure, and the image is rendered with the technique described in Section 4.1, these constants can be computed directly from Equation 18: pixel values all lie in the plane in color space spanned by the two primaries.

The left image gives the necessary intensities of 488nm light for each position in the color image, and the right image gives the corresponding intensities of 633nm light.</p></div>

The color reproduction on the simulated display is in good agreement with the computed images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we have discussed the dichromatic model of surface reflection and have shown how it can be applied t o the creation of images that can be rendered accurately on two-color displays. If a display system is too complex to easily implement three primaries or does not need true full color, two primaries may be sufficient. Also, if the images to be displayed have colors that can be arbitrarily selected, or if only a single object or a single class of objects that obey the dichromatic model are to be rendered, they can in principle be accurately reproduced with just two primaries. Applications where these criteria might hold include holographic stereograms, computer-generated holography, and non-holographic volume display systems. While the use of only two colors for display could not replace true full color, it could be useful for many natural and synthetic images.            </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>[3] and holography [4].
