				<p>A probe for the interactive visualization of jlow fields is presented. The probe can be used to visualize many characteristics of the jlow in detail for a small region in the data set. The velocity and the local change of velocity (the velocity gradient tensor) are visualized by a set of geometric primitives. To this end, the velocity gradient tensor is transformed to a local coordinate frame, and decomposed into components parallel with and perpendicular to the jlow. These components are visualized as geometric objects with an intuitively meaningful interpretation. An implementation is presented which shows that this probe is a useful tool forjow visualization.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Flow visualization is an important topic for data visualization research. Most of the recently published methods are concemed with global visualization of the flow. Volume rendering <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, flow topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> etc. show structures in flows, but do not allow a detailed look at a particular point in the flow field. The probe described here is intended as a complement to global visualization methods. The aim is to provide detailed information at a point by visual means and powerful user interaction.</p><p>A simple arrow only shows the magnitude and direction of the flow velocity at a point, but often not just velocity but changes in velocity are of interest. These velocity changes can be described by a second order real tensor. Therefore visualization of the local flow is in essence representation of a vector (velocity) and a tensor (velocity changes) in a point. To this end, meaningful values are extracted from the tensor which are represented by geometric objects.</p><p>In section 2 a brief introduction to tensors and their visualization is given. In section 3 a new method for the decomposition of a second order real tensor is proposed.</p><p>This decomposition is useful and intuitively clear in How fields. In section 4 the subsequent mapping on geometric objects is presented. In section 5 an implementation is described. Finally, in section 6 the results are discussed.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">J = vu= ( 'U, uy v</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>z ) . (2)</head><p>A subscript denotes a partial derivative, so 71, means a u / d z . To show local flow characteristics in a point a vector U and a tensor J must be visualized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Decomposition</head><p>Decomposition is an important tcchnique to achicve insight in a tensor. An often used decomposition is to split tensors in a symmetrical and an anti-symmetrical part [ 11:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">J = J ( S ) + .I(") ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>JT is the transpose of J . The anti-symmetrical pNt ha&lt; three independent components which determine the rotation of the velocity. The symmetrical part of the tensor is called the stress-strain tensor. If the directions of the orthogonal axes of reference are chosen such that the nondiagonal elements of the stress-strain tensor are zero, a&lt; is always possible, then the tensor represents a pure stretching motion. The axes of this frame are called the principal directions of the tensor. The axis along which the largest stretching occurs is called the major principal direction. The values of a real tensor can be interpreted in terms of the distortion of an infinitesimal fluid element around a point where the tensor is defined. In this way the decomposition of the tensor can be interpreted as imposing certain restrictions on the possible distortions of the fluid element. The tensor can be viewed as a superposition of those distortions. Decomposition in a symmetrical and anti-symmetrical part is the result of using a rigid object that can only rotate and a second object that can change shape but not rotate. This is not the only way the tensor can be decomposed. Other ways of decomposition result in other restrictions on the movement of the fluid element. For example, the symmetric part can be further decomposed into an isotropic expansion and two shearing motions[ 11.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Previous work</head><p>Several researchers have devised graphical representations of tensors. <ref type="bibr">Haber [5]</ref> represented a symmetric stress tensor by an object consisting of a shaft and a disc. The direction of the shaft is the major principal direction of the tensor. The axes of the elliptical disc correspond to the other two principal directions. The length of the shaft and the smallest and largest radius of the ellipse are proportional to the magnitudes of the eigenvalues of the tensor.</p><p>The  <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> show that a tensor field can be decomposed in a symmetric-tensor field and a vector field. To visualize the global structure of this symmetrictensor field they use hyperstreamlines. A hyperstreamline is an ellipse swept along the line everywhere tangent to the major principal direction of the tensor. The magnitude and direction of the other two principal directions at each point are reflected in the size of the swept ellipse. The resulting surface can be colored according to the magnitude of the principle direction.</p><p>The presented methods show a tensor field separated from the velocity field, and are therefore not very useful to visualize local flow. Further, they only show the symmetric part of the ten.wr while the velocity gradient is in general an asymmetrical tensor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Localflow</head><p>To visualize local flow via a probe, me'aningful quwtities must be derived from the raw data. In this section the mathematical basis for the probe is presented. The construction of a local coordinate frame is described, and next the tensor is transformed to this local coordinate frame and decomposed into primitives.</p><p>Because flow data usually are velocity vectors defined at grid nodes, the velocities are known only at discrete locations and must be interpolated in between. For this we use trilinear interpolation. The gradients are calculated by centered differences <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. So far we limited ourselves to rectilinear grids. Extension to curvilinear grids and irregular meshes is possible, but requires a more complex numerical evaluation of the Jacobian matrix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Local coordinate frame</head><p>The definition of a tensor implies its invariance for coordinate changes. In fluid flow, however, a distinction can be made between velocity changes parrrlli4 with the flow and perpendicular to the flow. This can be used to decompose the tensor in components parallel with the tlow and components perpendicular to the flow. Instead of a h i d clement, a "fluid line" and a "fluid plane" are used to map the distortion. Together these two elements can represent the same information as the fluid element mentioned bcfore.</p><p>Therefore, the velocity gradient tensor is tr'msformcd to a local coordinate frame ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">fig. 1</ref>). The origin of this fr'une is the point where the tensor is calculated. For the fr'une we use a Frenet frame [Z 21 with the z-axis parallel with the velocity vector and the y-axis parallel with the curvature vector. In order to define a Frenet coordinate frame, the curvature of a streamline through the origin has to be calculated. If the curvature is zero the Frenet frame is not defined. In this case any orthonormal frame with one ,%is aligned with the velocity can be used.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">c = -d2P<label>(4)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Decomposition and mapping ds2 '</head><p>In order to construct the probe, the tensor is decomposed into components in the direction of and perpendicular to the velocity ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">fig. 2</ref>). The components in the velocity direction are both the derivatives with respect to T (U,, TJ, and w,.) and the velocity component in the U direction ( T I , . , U,, ' and where s is the parameter of path length. Using the first order approximation of the velocity of an imaginary particle that moves along the streamline:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">u(t) = 110 + Juot ( 5 )</formula><p>and using the fact that it can be shown that the curvature vector at a point in the flow is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(7) JU(Uf U) -u(u . Ju) C = 11113</formula><p>With this vector and the velocity vector the Frenet frame can be constructed. The base of the frame consists of the normalized velocity vector, the normalized curvature vector and the cross product of those two vectors:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">UZ).</formula><p>The components in the perpendicular direction ( v~, T I , , wy and U J~) form the 2 x 2 lower-right submatrix of the Jacobian matrix. This last matrix is split in a symmetric and anti-symmetric part. Just like in the three-dimensional case arotation and a stress-strain-tensor result. These relate to torsion (rotation around the velocity vector) and convergence of the flow.</p><p>The velocity parallel components are split a% follows. The left column contains the velocity change with respect to <ref type="figure">z ( u z , U,, w,)</ref>. The top row contains the ch'ange of the velocity in the z-direction (Ti,, u y r u 2 ) . The top left element of the matrix <ref type="bibr">(U,)</ref> belongs to both the left column and the top row and gives the acceleration. The remaining elements in the top <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">row (uY and 71,)</ref> give the shear in the flow, and the remaining elements in the first column <ref type="figure">( T J~  and w,)</ref> give the curvature of the streamline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Theprobe</head><p>The previous section covered the mathematics of the tensor decomposition used for the probe. This section covers the mapping of the derived quantities to geometric primi-tives. The tensor is decomposed in five components: curvature, shear, acceleration, torsion and convergence. The acceleration and curvature are derived from the change in the velocity of a particle in the flow. The other three primitives show the velocity changes as seen from a ring or a disc perpendicular to the velocity. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref> shows a graphical representation of the probe. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Requirements</head><p>If decomposition is used then care has to be taken that the resulting components are independent. This is important mathematically as well as visually. Mathematically an orthogonal decomposition is desirable so that the different components can each change their value without affecting the other components. Also, the visualization of one component should not interfere with the visualization of the other. A primitive should for example not become arbiuarily large if the corresponding value in the tensor increases. Another requirement is that it must be clear if the value of a certain variable is zero.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Velocity</head><p>The velocity is represented by an arrow in the form of a cylinder and a cone. Its direction can be derived from the shading of the arrow. The length of the shaft of the arrow represents the magnitude of the velocity, its direction represents the direction of the velocity. In the local coordinate frame, velocity has only a component in the r-direction, therefore the magnitude velocity can be simply referred to as U.</p><p>The length of the velocity arrow is determined by the time scale At used. This also affects primitives related to the velocity (curvature, shear and acceleration). The length of the shaft is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">I = uAt . (9)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">3 Curvature</head><p>The curvature of the streamline is given by equation <ref type="formula">7</ref>. In the local frame the center of the osculating circle of the streamline is given by: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Acceleration</head><p>The value of U, determines the acceleration of a particle released at the origin of the reference fr,une. This acceleration is visualized by a "membrane" perpendicular to the flow. The value of the acceleration is mapped to the displacement of the center of the membrane. Zero acceleration (See color plates, p.  results in a flat membrane. If the acceleration is positive, a half ellipsoid in the direction of the velocity is shown, if it is negative (deceleration), the center of the membrane is stretched in the opposite direction. Thus, it shows the difference in velocity between the current position and at end of the velocity arrow. The displacement a of the center of the membrane is given by: a = u,At2u.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(12)</head><p>The square in the timestep At is caused by the fact that both the length of the arrow and the duration of the velocity change has to be taken in account.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Torsion</head><p>The torsion r around the velocity axis is the component of the rotation of the velocity gradient tensor in the direction of the x-axis:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">r = w y -v , .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(13)</head><p>The torsion is visualized as candy stripes on the surface of the velocity arrow. The total torsion angle (Y around the axis is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">(Y = rAt . (14)</formula><p>Torsion is closely related to helicity of the flow, helicity is the product of torsion and velocity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">U . V x U.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Shear</head><p>The shear in the direction of the flow can be interpreted as the change of orientation of the plane perpendicular to the flow over time ( <ref type="figure">fig. 5)</ref>. This shear-plane is visualized by a ring resulting from clipping the plane to two spheres of different size. The equation of the plane of the ring is: </p><formula xml:id="formula_10">2 = At(uyy + U,%) 7</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7">Convergence</head><p>Velocity changes in the plane perpendicular to the flow are related to convergence and divergence of the How. They affect the size and orientation of a circle releawl perpendicular to the flow. For visualization a surface that is everywhere perpendicular to the flow is used. This surface can be interpreted as a "lens" that focuses the flow <ref type="figure">(fig. 6)</ref>.</p><p>Here we use the osculating paraboloid [3] to this surface to represent its curvature, just as we used an osculating circle to represent the curvature of a streamline. The diskulce 6(q, e) of an osculatingparaboloid to the t'ulgent plane with unit normal N is given by: M and N can be determined similarly. If y and z of the reference frame are chosen as the surface parameters 7 "I &lt;, then the equation for the surface perpendicular to the velocity reduces to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">T = -2 v y2 -(212 + wy) yz ---2 'lo2 I . (18)</formula><p>This equation is used to construct the surface. Rendering the surface as a disc with a fixed radius a$ domain poses problems when the differentials are large: the edges will he far from the probe. To prevent this, the surface is clipped against a sphere around the origin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>U U U 5 Implementation</head><p>To test the concept of the probe an interactive application was written. The application was implemented on a SGI workstation using the C programming language. The user interface was built using 'Forms' <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, a public domain user interface toolkit. For testing purposes simple artificial data sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, and a data set generated by Robert Wilhelmson of NCSA were used. This set is the result of a numerical simulation of a tornado generated assuming symmetry in the azimuthal direction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">User interface</head><p>The application provides the user with two views on the flow area ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">fig. 7)</ref>. The first is a global view, which shows the position of the probe in the flow area. The second view gives an enlarged view of the probe. The user can interact with the probe in both views. In the global view the user can position the probe at a certain location. Its position in the flow area is indicated by two lines connected to the bounds of the area. In the enlarged view the user can choose a point of view to the probe.</p><p>If the user is not interested in certain aspects of the flow, the corresponding primitives can be turned off. Copies of the probe or components of it can be left behind at interesting positions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">fig. 8</ref>). With these additional tools a more global impression of the flow can be achieved. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref> is an example of how the probe can be applied to a data set. The storm data set is portrayed by severd probes. These probes are interactively placed hy the user to show interesting locations in the flow. The c h a m p of velocity in the vertical direction along the eye of the tomndo are clearly visible. Furthermore, a streamline with several probes along it is shown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Display of other data</head><p>To show other data at the location of the prohe. such as temperature or pressure, a "valuebox" is used. The valuebox is a small display with a constant position rehtive to the probe on the screen. If the probe is moving or moved the box moves along with it on the screen. The v:due of the property is updated according to the current position of the probe. This valuebox can also be used for the v:dues already visualized by the shape of the probe, so the exact value of the property at a certain point can be clctcnniaccl eaqily.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>In this paper a probing tool for the interactive visualization of local flow is presented. It gives a researcher the possibility to investigate details of the flow and is complementary to other methods of flow visualization. Additional tools such as animation and the visibility of multiple probes offer the possibility of global insight in tbe flow. Mapping of the tensor on geometric objects simplifies understanding of the abstract data. Because current graphics hardware allows fast rendering of polygons, interactive speeds are easily achieved. The same principle could be applied to other types of multi-variate data sets, but possibly requires the design of appropriate sets of primitives.</p><p>Some features of the tensor cannot yet be extracted from the probe. An example is dilatation. A valuebox could be used for that, but a solution where those values are represented in the probe would be better. In this paper we assumed time independent Aow. In practice many simulations produce time dependent data. Extending the probe for use in such data requires that spatial and temporal derivatives are considered.</p><p>At critical points [q, where the magnitude of the velocity vanishes, it is impossible to construct a local frame of reference. In these points another repmentation for the local flow has to be used. A possibility is the use of special types of icons for each type of critical point (vortex, sink, source, saddle or combination of those).</p><p>The probe can be used in combination with other visualization techniques. A global visualization technique could be used to show the overall structure of the data while the probe is used to investigate certain regions of the data in detail.</p><p>A Probe f o r Local Flow Field Visrruli:atioii, W.C. de Leeuw and J.J. van Wijk, pp. 39-45. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>2</head><label></label><figDesc>Tensor visualization near a point xfl is: In a vector field the first order approximation of ~( x ) u(x) = u(x0) + J ( xxo) .</figDesc></figure>
