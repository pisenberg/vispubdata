"We present an integrated approach for creating and assigning color palettes to different visualizations such as multi-class scatterplots, line, and bar charts. While other methods separate the creation of colors from their assignment, our approach takes data characteristics into account to produce color palettes, which are then assigned in a way that fosters better visual discrimination of classes. To do so, we use a customized optimization based on simulated annealing to maximize the combination of three carefully designed color scoring functions: point distinctness, name difference, and color discrimination. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art palettes with a controlled user study for scatterplots and line charts, furthermore we performed a case study. Our results show that Palettailor, as a fully-automated approach, generates color palettes with a higher discrimination quality than existing approaches. The efficiency of our optimization allows us also to incorporate user modifications into the color selection process.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222351/","LOCKED","9222351","Shandong University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086253868","1","Kecheng Lu","37086253868","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Twitter Inc.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655479","2","Mi Feng","37088655479","Shandong University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543204","3","Xin Chen","37086543204","VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590945600","4","Michael Sedlmair","37590945600","Shenzhen VisuCA Key Lab, SIAT, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266781000","5","Oliver Deussen","37266781000","Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37418740700","6","Dani Lischinski","37418740700","Shenzhen VisuCA Key Lab, SIAT, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086496223","7","Zhanglin Cheng","37086496223","Shandong University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085804605","8","Yunhai Wang","37085804605","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030406","484","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222351/","Color Palette","Discriminability","Multi-Class Scatterplot","Line Chart","Bar Chart","","","","","","Image color analysis","Data visualization","Optimization","Task analysis","Bars","Visualization","Tools","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222351","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","1","475","Palettailor: Discriminable Colorization for Categorical Data","27"
"Ubiquitous, situated, and physical visualizations create entirely new possibilities for tasks contextualized in the real world, such as doctors inserting needles. During the development of situated visualizations, evaluating visualizations is a core requirement. However, performing such evaluations is intrinsically hard as the real scenarios are safety-critical or expensive to test. To overcome these issues, researchers and practitioners adapt classical approaches from ubiquitous computing and use surrogate empirical methods such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) prototypes, or merely online demonstrations. This approach's primary assumption is that meaningful insights can also be gained from different, usually cheaper and less cumbersome empirical methods. Nevertheless, recent efforts in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community have found evidence against this assumption, which would impede the use of surrogate empirical methods. Currently, these insights rely on a single investigation of four interactive objects. The goal of this work is to investigate if these prior findings also hold for situated visualizations. Therefore, we first created a scenario where situated visualizations support users in do-it-yourself (DIY) tasks such as crafting and assembly. We then set up five empirical study methods to evaluate the four tasks using an online survey, as well as VR, AR, laboratory, and in-situ studies. Using this study design, we conducted a new study with 60 participants. Our results show that the situated visualizations we investigated in this study are not prone to the same dependency on the empirical method, as found in previous work. Our study provides the first evidence that analyzing situated visualizations through different empirical (surrogate) methods might lead to comparable results.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9225008/","LOCKED","9225008","University of Stuttgart, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088658567","1","Maximilian Weiß","37088658567","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Stuttgart, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088642160","2","Katrin Angerbauer","37088642160","adesso SE, Dortmund","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656623","3","Alexandra Voit","37088656623","University of Stuttgart, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088585674","4","Magdalena Schwarzl","37088585674","University of Stuttgart, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590945600","5","Michael Sedlmair","37590945600","Carnegie Mellon University, United States","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656426","6","Sven Mayer","37088656426","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030400","1213","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9225008/","Situated visualization","evaluation","comparison","","","","","","","","Visualization","Task analysis","Data visualization","Fasteners","Human computer interaction","Needles","Tools","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9225008","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","2","1204","Revisited: Comparison of Empirical Methods to Evaluate Visualizations Supporting Crafting and Assembly Purposes","27"
"For the many journalists who use data and computation to report the news, data wrangling is an integral part of their work. Despite an abundance of literature on data wrangling in the context of enterprise data analysis, little is known about the specific operations, processes, and pain points journalists encounter while performing this tedious, time-consuming task. To better understand the needs of this user group, we conduct a technical observation study of 50 public repositories of data and analysis code authored by 33 professional journalists at 26 news organizations. We develop two detailed and cross-cutting taxonomies of data wrangling in computational journalism, for actions and for processes. We observe the extensive use of multiple tables, a notable gap in previous wrangling analyses. We develop a concise, actionable framework for general multi-table data wrangling that includes wrangling operations documented in our taxonomy that are without clear parallels in other work. This framework, the first to incorporate tables as first-class objects, will support future interactive wrangling tools for both computational journalism and general-purpose use. We assess the generative and descriptive power of our framework through discussion of its relationship to our set of taxonomies.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229515/","LOCKED","9229515","Department of Computer ScienceUniversity of British Columbia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655548","1","Stephen Kasica","37088655548","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of British Columbia, School of Journalism, Writing, and Media","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655740","2","Charles Berret","37088655740","Department of Computer ScienceUniversity of British Columbia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349490300","3","Tamara Munzner","37349490300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030462","966","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229515/","Computational journalism","Data journalism","Data wrangling","","","","","","","","Journalism","Taxonomy","Tools","Data analysis","Encoding","Task analysis","Cleaning","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9229515","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","3","957","Table Scraps: An Actionable Framework for Multi-Table Data Wrangling From An Artifact Study of Computational Journalism","27"
"In soccer, passing is the most frequent interaction between players and plays a significant role in creating scoring chances. Experts are interested in analyzing players' passing behavior to learn passing tactics, i.e., how players build up an attack with passing. Various approaches have been proposed to facilitate the analysis of passing tactics. However, the dynamic changes of a team's employed tactics over a match have not been comprehensively investigated. To address the problem, we closely collaborate with domain experts and characterize requirements to analyze the dynamic changes of a team's passing tactics. To characterize the passing tactic employed for each attack, we propose a topic-based approach that provides a high-level abstraction of complex passing behaviors. Based on the model, we propose a glyph-based design to reveal the multi-variate information of passing tactics within different phases of attacks, including player identity, spatial context, and formation. We further design and develop PassVizor, a visual analytics system, to support the comprehensive analysis of passing dynamics. With the system, users can detect the changing patterns of passing tactics and examine the detailed passing process for evaluating passing tactics. We invite experts to conduct analysis with PassVizor and demonstrate the usability of the system through an expert interview.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222314/","LOCKED","9222314","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086448603","1","Xiao Xie","37086448603","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086242334","2","Jiachen Wang","37086242334","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546613","3","Hongye Liang","37086546613","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544875","4","Dazhen Deng","37086544875","Department of Sport ScienceZhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547287","5","Shoubin Cheng","37086547287","Department of Sport ScienceZhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086236404","6","Hui Zhang","37086236404","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085418543","7","Wei Chen","37085418543","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","8","Yingcai Wu","37407308300","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030359","1331","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222314/","Soccer Analysis","Passing Analysis","","","","","","","","","Sports","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Interviews","Pattern matching","Navigation","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222314","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","4","1322","PassVizor: Toward Better Understanding of the Dynamics of Soccer Passes","27"
"With machine learning models being increasingly applied to various decision-making scenarios, people have spent growing efforts to make machine learning models more transparent and explainable. Among various explanation techniques, counterfactual explanations have the advantages of being human-friendly and actionable-a counterfactual explanation tells the user how to gain the desired prediction with minimal changes to the input. Besides, counterfactual explanations can also serve as efficient probes to the models' decisions. In this work, we exploit the potential of counterfactual explanations to understand and explore the behavior of machine learning models. We design DECE, an interactive visualization system that helps understand and explore a model's decisions on individual instances and data subsets, supporting users ranging from decision-subjects to model developers. DECE supports exploratory analysis of model decisions by combining the strengths of counterfactual explanations at instance- and subgroup-levels. We also introduce a set of interactions that enable users to customize the generation of counterfactual explanations to find more actionable ones that can suit their needs. Through three use cases and an expert interview, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DECE in supporting decision exploration tasks and instance explanations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229232/","LOCKED","9229232","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100335","1","Furui Cheng","37087100335","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086012043","2","Yao Ming","37086012043","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085648134","3","Huamin Qu","37085648134","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030342","1447","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229232/","Tabular Data","Explainable Machine Learning","Counterfactual Explanation","Decision Making","","","","","","","Machine learning","Analytical models","Predictive models","Tools","Computational modeling","Decision making","Data models","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9229232","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","5","1438","DECE: Decision Explorer with Counterfactual Explanations for Machine Learning Models","27"
"In the modern drug discovery process, medicinal chemists deal with the complexity of analysis of large ensembles of candidate molecules. Computational tools, such as dimensionality reduction (DR) and classification, are commonly used to efficiently process the multidimensional space of features. These underlying calculations often hinder interpretability of results and prevent experts from assessing the impact of individual molecular features on the resulting representations. To provide a solution for scrutinizing such complex data, we introduce ChemVA, an interactive application for the visual exploration of large molecular ensembles and their features. Our tool consists of multiple coordinated views: Hexagonal view, Detail view, 3D view, Table view, and a newly proposed Difference view designed for the comparison of DR projections. These views display DR projections combined with biological activity, selected molecular features, and confidence scores for each of these projections. This conjunction of views allows the user to drill down through the dataset and to efficiently select candidate compounds. Our approach was evaluated on two case studies of finding structurally similar ligands with similar binding affinity to a target protein, as well as on an external qualitative evaluation. The results suggest that our system allows effective visual inspection and comparison of different high-dimensional molecular representations. Furthermore, ChemVA assists in the identification of candidate compounds while providing information on the certainty behind different molecular representations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222282/","LOCKED","9222282","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad Nacional del Sur, Institute for Computer Science and Engineering (UNS-CONICET), Bahía, Blanca, Argentina","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656320","1","María Virginia Sabando","37088656320","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086932309","2","Pavol Ulbrich","37086932309","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad Nacional del Sur, Institute for Computer Science and Engineering (UNS-CONICET), Bahía, Blanca, Argentina","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656098","3","Matías Selzer","37088656098","Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085717963","4","Jan Byška","37085717963","Department of Experimental Biology and RECETOX, Loschmidt Laboratories, Faculty of Medicine Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655410","5","Jan Mičan","37088655410","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad Nacional del Sur, Institute for Computer Science and Engineering (UNS-CONICET), Bahía, Blanca, Argentina","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945587000","6","Ignacio Ponzoni","37945587000","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad Nacional del Sur, Institute for Computer Science and Engineering (UNS-CONICET), Bahía, Blanca, Argentina","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656445","7","Axel J.

"Deep learning methods are being increasingly used for urban traffic prediction where spatiotemporal traffic data is aggregated into sequentially organized matrices that are then fed into convolution-based residual neural networks. However, the widely known modifiable areal unit problem within such aggregation processes can lead to perturbations in the network inputs. This issue can significantly destabilize the feature embeddings and the predictions - rendering deep networks much less useful for the experts. This paper approaches this challenge by leveraging unit visualization techniques that enable the investigation of many-to-many relationships between dynamically varied multi-scalar aggregations of urban traffic data and neural network predictions. Through regular exchanges with a domain expert, we design and develop a visual analytics solution that integrates 1) a Bivariate Map equipped with an advanced bivariate colormap to simultaneously depict input traffic and prediction errors across space, 2) a Moran's I Scatterplot that provides local indicators of spatial association analysis, and 3) a Multi-scale Attribution View that arranges non-linear dot plots in a tree layout to promote model analysis and comparison across scales. We evaluate our approach through a series of case studies involving a real-world dataset of Shenzhen taxi trips, and through interviews with domain experts. We observe that geographical scale variations have important impact on prediction performances, and interactive visual exploration of dynamically varying inputs and outputs benefit experts in the development of deep traffic prediction models.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9228894/","LOCKED","9228894","Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101788","1","Wei Zeng","37087101788","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Xiamen University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655355","2","Chengqiao Lin","37088655355","Xiamen University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655819","3","Juncong Lin","37088655819","Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656150","4","Jincheng Jiang","37088656150","Central South University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37531405500","5","Jiazhi Xia","37531405500","University of Warwick, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37567685600","6","Cagatay Turkay","37567685600","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","7","Wei Chen","37291847800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030410","848","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9228894/","MAUP","traffic prediction","deep learning","model diagnostic","visual analytics","","","","","","Predictive models","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Analytical models","Uncertainty","Perturbation methods","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9228894","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","7","839","Revisiting the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem in Deep Traffic Prediction with Visual Analytics","27"
"We examine the process of designing an exhibit to communicate scientific findings from a complex dataset and unfamiliar domain to the public in a science museum. Our exhibit sought to communicate new lessons based on scientific findings from the domain of metagenomics. This multi-user exhibit had three goals: (1) to inform the public about microbial communities and their daily cycles; (2) to link microbes' activity to the concept of gene expression; (3) and to highlight scientists' use of gene expression data to understand the role of microbes. To address these three goals, we derived visualization designs with three corresponding stories, each corresponding to a goal. We present three successive rounds of design and evaluation of our attempts to convey these goals. We could successfully present one story but had limited success with our second and third goals. This work presents a detailed account of an attempt to explain tightly coupled relationships through storytelling and animation in a multi-user, informal learning environment to a public with varying prior knowledge on the domain and identify lessons for future design.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9241413/","LOCKED","9241413","UC Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086925054","1","Keshav Dasu","37086925054","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","UC Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085432740","2","Kwan-Liu Ma","37085432740","The Exploratorium","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489269900","3","Joyce Ma","38489269900","The Exploratorium","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233965200","4","Jennifer Frazier","38233965200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030412","945","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9241413/","Narrative visualization","storytelling","animation","evaluation","user studies","informal learning environments","","","","","Animation","Data visualization","Meteorology","Prototypes","Gene expression","Atmospheric modeling","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9241413","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","8","935","Sea of Genes: A Reflection on Visualising Metagenomic Data for Museums","27"
"We propose a visualization method to understand the effect of multidimensional projection on local subspaces, using implicit function differentiation. Here, we understand the local subspace as the multidimensional local neighborhood of data points. Existing methods focus on the projection of multidimensional data points, and the neighborhood information is ignored. Our method is able to analyze the shape and directional information of the local subspace to gain more insights into the global structure of the data through the perception of local structures. Local subspaces are fitted by multidimensional ellipses that are spanned by basis vectors. An accurate and efficient vector transformation method is proposed based on analytical differentiation of multidimensional projections formulated as implicit functions.

"Significant research has provided robust task and evaluation languages for the analysis of exploratory visualizations. Unfortunately, these taxonomies fail when applied to communicative visualizations. Instead, designers often resort to evaluating communicative visualizations from the cognitive efficiency perspective: “can the recipient accurately decode my message/insight?” However, designers are unlikely to be satisfied if the message went ‘in one ear and out the other.’ The consequence of this inconsistency is that it is difficult to design or select between competing options in a principled way. The problem we address is the fundamental mismatch between how designers want to describe their intent, and the language they have. We argue that visualization designers can address this limitation through a learning lens: that the recipient is a student and the designer a teacher. By using learning objectives, designers can better define, assess, and compare communicative visualizations. We illustrate how the learning-based approach provides a framework for understanding a wide array of communicative goals. To understand how the framework can be applied (and its limitations), we surveyed and interviewed members of the Data Visualization Society using their own visualizations as a probe. Through this study we identified the broad range of objectives in communicative visualizations and the prevalence of certain objective types.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222102/","LOCKED","9222102","University of Michigan","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37331417100","1","Eytan Adar","37331417100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Michigan","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655825","2","Elsie Lee","37088655825","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030375","956","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222102/","Learning objectives","communicative visualization","visualization design","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Taxonomy","Task analysis","Visualization","Elbow","Tools","Correlation","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222102","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","10","946","Communicative Visualizations as a Learning Problem","27"
"How do analysts think about grouping and spatial operations? This overarching research question incorporates a number of points for investigation, including understanding how analysts begin to explore a dataset, the types of grouping/spatial structures created and the operations performed on them, the relationship between grouping and spatial structures, the decisions analysts make when exploring individual observations, and the role of external information. This work contributes the design and results of such a study, in which a group of participants are asked to organize the data contained within an unfamiliar quantitative dataset. We identify several overarching approaches taken by participants to design their organizational space, discuss the interactions performed by the participants, and propose design recommendations to improve the usability of future high-dimensional data exploration tools that make use of grouping (clustering) and spatial (dimension reduction) operations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9217981/","LOCKED","9217981","Virginia Tech Department of Computer Science and the Discovery Analytics Center","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233577000","1","John Wenskovitch","38233577000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Virginia Tech Department of Computer Science and the Discovery Analytics Center","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37419565900","2","Chris North","37419565900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028890","1752","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9217981/","Clustering","dimension reduction","spatialization","grouping","cognitive study","","","","","","Task analysis","Tools","Cognition","Dimensionality reduction","Visualization","Data analysis","Semantics","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9217981","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","11","1742","An Examination of Grouping and Spatial Organization Tasks for High-Dimensional Data Exploration","27"
"An important approach for scientific inquiry across many disciplines involves using observational time series data to understand the relationships between key variables to gain mechanistic insights into the underlying rules that govern the given system. In real systems, such as those found in ecology, the relationships between time series variables are generally not static; instead, these relationships are dynamical and change in a nonlinear or state-dependent manner. To further understand such systems, we investigate integrating methods that appropriately characterize these dynamics (i.e., methods that measure interactions as they change with time-varying system states) with visualization techniques that can help analyze the behavior of the system. Here, we focus on empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as a state-of-the-art method that specifically identifies causal variables and measures changing state-dependent relationships between time series variables. Instead of using approaches centered on parametric equations, EDM is an equation-free approach that studies systems based on their dynamic attractors. We propose a visual analytics system to support the identification and mechanistic interpretation of system states using an EDM-constructed dynamic graph. This work, as detailed in four analysis tasks and demonstrated with a GUI, provides a novel synthesis of EDM and visualization techniques such as brush-link visualization and visual summarization to interpret dynamic graphs representing ecosystem dynamics. We applied our proposed system to ecological simulation data and real data from a marine mesocosm study as two key use cases. Our case studies show that our visual analytics tools support the identification and interpretation of the system state by the user, and enable us to discover both confirmatory and new findings in ecosystem dynamics. Overall, we demonstrated that our system can facilitate an understanding of how systems function beyond the intuitive analysis of high-dimensional information based on specific domain knowledge.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216532/","LOCKED","9216532","Kyoto University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38468551100","1","Hiroaki Natsukawa","38468551100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Boston University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655987","2","Ethan R.

"Temporal event sequence alignment has been used in many domains to visualize nuanced changes and interactions over time. Existing approaches align one or two sentinel events. Overview tasks require examining all alignments of interest using interaction and time or juxtaposition of many visualizations. Furthermore, any event attribute overviews are not closely tied to sequence visualizations. We present Sequence Braiding, a novel overview visualization for temporal event sequences and attributes using a layered directed acyclic network. Sequence Braiding visually aligns many temporal events and attribute groups simultaneously and supports arbitrary ordering, absence, and duplication of events. In a controlled experiment we compare Sequence Braiding and IDMVis on user task completion time, correctness, error, and confidence. Our results provide good evidence that users of Sequence Braiding can understand high-level patterns and trends faster and with similar error.

"In this paper, we present a visual analytics tool for enabling hypothesis-based evaluation of machine learning (ML) models. We describe a novel ML-testing framework that combines the traditional statistical hypothesis testing (commonly used in empirical research) with logical reasoning about the conclusions of multiple hypotheses. The framework defines a controlled configuration for testing a number of hypotheses as to whether and how some extra information about a “concept” or “feature” may benefit or hinder an ML model. Because reasoning multiple hypotheses is not always straightforward, we provide HypoML as a visual analysis tool, with which, the multi-thread testing results are first transformed to analytical results using statistical and logical inferences, and then to a visual representation for rapid observation of the conclusions and the logical flow between the testing results and hypotheses. We have applied HypoML to a number of hypothesized concepts, demonstrating the intuitive and explainable nature of the visual analysis.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222284/","LOCKED","9222284","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543277","1","Qianwen Wang","37086543277","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Oxford, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655330","2","William Alexander","37088655330","University of Oxford, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655415","3","Jack Pegg","37088655415","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","4","Huamin Qu","37272637300","University of Oxford, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085654077","5","Min Chen","37085654077","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030449","1426","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222284/","Visual analytics","model-developmental visualization","machine learning","neural network","hypothesis test","HypoML","","","","","Analytical models","Testing","Data models","Computational modeling","Tools","Visualization","Neurons","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222284","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","14","1417","HypoML: Visual Analysis for Hypothesis-based Evaluation of Machine Learning Models","27"
"We present V2V, a novel deep learning framework, as a general-purpose solution to the variable-to-variable (V2V) selection and translation problem for multivariate time-varying data (MTVD) analysis and visualization. V2V leverages a representation learning algorithm to identify transferable variables and utilizes Kullback-Leibler divergence to determine the source and target variables. It then uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the mapping from the source variable to the target variable via the adversarial, volumetric, and feature losses. V2V takes the pairs of time steps of the source and target variable as input for training, Once trained, it can infer unseen time steps of the target variable given the corresponding time steps of the source variable. Several multivariate time-varying data sets of different characteristics are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of V2V, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We compare V2V against histogram matching and two other deep learning solutions (Pix2Pix and CycleGAN).","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9230431/","LOCKED","9230431","University of Notre Dame","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086862620","1","Jun Han","37086862620","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Notre Dame","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086864734","2","Hao Zheng","37086864734","Sichuan University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087128047","3","Yunhao Xing","37087128047","University of Notre Dame","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38194458500","4","Danny Z.

"Tax evasion is a serious economic problem for many countries, as it can undermine the government's tax system and lead to an unfair business competition environment. Recent research has applied data analytics techniques to analyze and detect tax evasion behaviors of individual taxpayers. However, they have failed to support the analysis and exploration of the related party transaction tax evasion (RPTTE) behaviors (e.g., transfer pricing), where a group of taxpayers is involved. In this paper, we present TaxThemis, an interactive visual analytics system to help tax officers mine and explore suspicious tax evasion groups through analyzing heterogeneous tax-related data. A taxpayer network is constructed and fused with the respective trade network to detect suspicious RPTTE groups. Rich visualizations are designed to facilitate the exploration and investigation of suspicious transactions between related taxpayers with profit and topological data analysis. Specifically, we propose a calendar heatmap with a carefully-designed encoding scheme to intuitively show the evidence of transferring revenue through related party transactions. We demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of TaxThemis through two case studies on real-world tax-related data and interviews with domain experts.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222068/","LOCKED","9222068","MOEKLINNS LabXi 'an Jiaotong University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087127282","1","Yating Lin","37087127282","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656934","2","Kamkwai Wong","37088656934","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085635207","3","Yong Wang","37085635207","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655791","4","Rong Zhang","37088655791","National Engineering Lab of Big Data Analytics, Xi'an Jiaotong University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546247500","5","Bo Dong","37546247500","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","6","Huamin Qu","37272637300","MOEKLINNS LabXi 'an Jiaotong University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268131800","7","Qinghua Zheng","37268131800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030370","859","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222068/","Visual Analytics","Tax Network","Tax Evasion Detection","Anomaly detection","Multidimensional data","","","","","","Finance","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Bars","Network topology","Investment","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222068","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","16","849","TaxThemis: Interactive Mining and Exploration of Suspicious Tax Evasion Groups","27"
"The overview-driven visual analysis of large-scale dynamic graphs poses a major challenge. We propose Multiscale Snapshots, a visual analytics approach to analyze temporal summaries of dynamic graphs at multiple temporal scales. First, we recursively generate temporal summaries to abstract overlapping sequences of graphs into compact snapshots. Second, we apply graph embeddings to the snapshots to learn low-dimensional representations of each sequence of graphs to speed up specific analytical tasks (e.g., similarity search). Third, we visualize the evolving data from a coarse to fine-granular snapshots to semi-automatically analyze temporal states, trends, and outliers. The approach enables us to discover similar temporal summaries (e.g., reoccurring states), reduces the temporal data to speed up automatic analysis, and to explore both structural and temporal properties of a dynamic graph. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by a quantitative evaluation and the application to a real-world dataset.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222072/","LOCKED","9222072","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085640263","1","Eren Cakmak","37085640263","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086560746","2","Udo Schlegel","37086560746","Independent Researcher, Munich, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233561600","3","Dominik Jäckle","38233561600","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","4","Daniel Keim","37283138700","TU Graz, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","5","Tobias Schreck","37282557600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030398","527","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222072/","Dynamic Graph","Dynamic Network","Unsupervised Graph Learning","Graph Embedding","Multiscale Visualization","","","","","","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Task analysis","Dimensionality reduction","Animation","Scalability","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222072","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","17","517","Multiscale Snapshots: Visual Analysis of Temporal Summaries in Dynamic Graphs","27"
"Building on game design and education research, this paper introduces narrative-focused role-playing games as a way to promote visualization literacy in young children. Visualization literacy skills are vital in understanding the world around us and constructing meaningful visualizations, yet, how to better develop these skills at an early age remains largely overlooked and understudied. Only recently has the visualization community started to fill this gap, resulting in preliminary studies and development of educational tools for use in early education. We add to these efforts through the exploration of gamification to support learning, and identify an opportunity to apply role-playing game-based designs by leveraging the presence of narratives in data-related problems involving visualizations. We study the effects of including narrative elements on learning through a technology probe, grounded in a set of design considerations stemming from visualization, game design and education science. We create two versions of a game - one with narrative elements and one without - and evaluate our instances on 33 child participants between 11- to 13-years old using a between-subjects study design. Despite participants requiring double the amount of time to complete their game due to additional narrative elements, the inclusion of such elements were found to improve engagement without sacrificing learning; our results indicate no significant differences in development of graph-reading skills, but significant differences in engagement and overall enjoyment of the game. We report observations and qualitative feedback collected, and note areas for improvement and room for future work.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222251/","LOCKED","9222251","Department of Computer ScienceUniversity of Toronto","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655952","1","Elaine Huynh","37088655952","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655428","2","Angela Nyhout","37088655428","Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655370","3","Patricia Ganea","37088655370","Department of Computer Science and Statistical SciencesUniversity of Toronto","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395495900","4","Fanny Chevalier","37395495900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030464","934","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222251/","Visualization Literacy","Educational technology","Gamification","Narrative","","","","","","","Data visualization","Games","Education","Visualization","Computer science","Tools","Probes","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222251","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","18","924","Designing Narrative-Focused Role-Playing Games for Visualization Literacy in Young Children","27"
"To interpret information visualizations, observers must determine how visual features map onto concepts. First and foremost, this ability depends on perceptual discriminability; observers must be able to see the difference between different colors for those colors to communicate different meanings. However, the ability to interpret visualizations also depends on semantic discriminability, the degree to which observers can infer a unique mapping between visual features and concepts, based on the visual features and concepts alone (i.e., without help from verbal cues such as legends or labels). Previous evidence suggested that observers were better at interpreting encoding systems that maximized semantic discriminability (maximizing association strength between assigned colors and concepts while minimizing association strength between unassigned colors and concepts), compared to a system that only maximized color-concept association strength. However, increasing semantic discriminability also resulted in increased perceptual distance, so it is unclear which factor was responsible for improved performance. In the present study, we conducted two experiments that tested for independent effects of semantic distance and perceptual distance on semantic discriminability of bar graph data visualizations. Perceptual distance was large enough to ensure colors were more than just noticeably different. We found that increasing semantic distance improved performance, independent of variation in perceptual distance, and when these two factors were uncorrelated, responses were dominated by semantic distance. These results have implications for navigating trade-offs in color palette design optimization for visual communication.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9239918/","LOCKED","9239918","Psychology and Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, University of Wisconsin-Madison","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085509824","1","Karen B.

"In this paper, we propose SineStream, a new variant of streamgraphs that improves their readability by minimizing sine illusion effects. Such effects reflect the tendency of humans to take the orthogonal rather than the vertical distance between two curves as their distance. In SineStream, we connect the readability of streamgraphs with minimizing sine illusions and by doing so provide a perceptual foundation for their design. As the geometry of a streamgraph is controlled by its baseline (the bottom-most curve) and the ordering of the layers, we re-interpret baseline computation and layer ordering algorithms in terms of reducing sine illusion effects. For baseline computation, we improve previous methods by introducing a Gaussian weight to penalize layers with large thickness changes. For layer ordering, three design requirements are proposed and implemented through a hierarchical clustering algorithm.

"Causality visualization can help people understand temporal chains of events, such as messages sent in a distributed system, cause and effect in a historical conflict, or the interplay between political actors over time. However, as the scale and complexity of these event sequences grows, even these visualizations can become overwhelming to use. In this paper, we propose the use of textual narratives as a data-driven storytelling method to augment causality visualization. We first propose a design space for how textual narratives can be used to describe causal data. We then present results from a crowdsourced user study where participants were asked to recover causality information from two causality visualizations-causal graphs and Hasse diagrams-with and without an associated textual narrative. Finally, we describe Causeworks, a causality visualization system for understanding how specific interventions influence a causal model. The system incorporates an automatic textual narrative mechanism based on our design space. We validate Causeworks through interviews with experts who used the system for understanding complex events.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222357/","LOCKED","9222357","Virginia Tech, Arlington, VA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085403900","1","Arjun Choudhry","37085403900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Virginia Tech, Arlington, VA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656681","2","Mandar Sharma","37088656681","University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656039","3","Pramod Chundury","37088656039","Uncharted Software, Toronto, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37704437500","4","Thomas Kapler","37704437500","Uncharted Software, Toronto, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656506","5","Derek W.

"Tools and interfaces are increasingly expected to be synchronous and distributed to accommodate remote collaboration. Yet, adoption of these techniques for data visualization is low partly because development is difficult: existing collaboration software systems either do not support simultaneous interaction or require expensive redevelopment of existing visualizations. We contribute VisConnect: a web-based synchronous distributed collaborative visualization system that supports most web-based SVG data visualizations, balances system safety with responsiveness, and supports simultaneous interaction from many collaborators. VisConnect works with existing visualization implementations with little-to-no code changes by synchronizing low-level JavaScript events across clients such that visualization updates proceed transparently across clients. This is accomplished via a peer-to-peer system that establishes consensus among clients on the per-element sequence of events, and uses a lock service to grant access over elements to clients. We contribute collaborative extensions of traditional visualization interaction techniques, such as drag, brush, and lasso, and discuss different strategies for collaborative visualization interactions. To demonstrate the utility of VisConnect, we present novel examples of collaborative visualizations in the healthcare domain, remote collaboration with annotation, and show in an education case study for e-learning with 22 participants that students found the ability to remotely collaborate on class activities helpful and enjoyable for understanding concepts.

"Most visual analytics systems assume that all foraging for data happens before the analytics process; once analysis begins, the set of data attributes considered is fixed. Such separation of data construction from analysis precludes iteration that can enable foraging informed by the needs that arise in-situ during the analysis. The separation of the foraging loop from the data analysis tasks can limit the pace and scope of analysis. In this paper, we present CAVA, a system that integrates data curation and data augmentation with the traditional data exploration and analysis tasks, enabling information foraging in-situ during analysis. Identifying attributes to add to the dataset is difficult because it requires human knowledge to determine which available attributes will be helpful for the ensuing analytical tasks. CAVA crawls knowledge graphs to provide users with a a broad set of attributes drawn from external data to choose from. Users can then specify complex operations on knowledge graphs to construct additional attributes. CAVA shows how visual analytics can help users forage for attributes by letting users visually explore the set of available data, and by serving as an interface for query construction. It also provides visualizations of the knowledge graph itself to help users understand complex joins such as multi-hop aggregations. We assess the ability of our system to enable users to perform complex data combinations without programming in a user study over two datasets. We then demonstrate the generalizability of CAVA through two additional usage scenarios. The results of the evaluation confirm that CAVA is effective in helping the user perform data foraging that leads to improved analysis outcomes, and offer evidence in support of integrating data augmentation as a part of the visual analytics pipeline.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222249/","LOCKED","9222249","Tufts University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086047966","1","Dylan Cashman","37086047966","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Georgia Tech.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655982","2","Shenyu Xu","37088655982","Georgia Tech.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086216294","3","Subhajit Das","37086216294","University of Wisconsin, Madison","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490630000","4","Florian Heimerl","38490630000","Tufts University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656478","5","Cong Liu","37088656478","San Francisco State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085489953","6","Shah Rukh Humayoun","37085489953","University of Wisconsin, Madison","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282585700","7","Michael Gleicher","37282585700","Georgia Tech.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681759500","8","Alex Endert","37681759500","Tufts University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","9","Remco Chang","37592409400","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030443","1741","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222249/","Visual Analytics","Information Foraging","Data Augmentation","","","","","","","","Task analysis","Visual analytics","Machine learning","Data models","Data visualization","Google","Training","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222249","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","23","1731","CAVA: A Visual Analytics System for Exploratory Columnar Data Augmentation Using Knowledge Graphs","27"

"Data visualizations convert numbers into visual marks so that our visual system can extract data from an image instead of raw numbers. Clearly, the visual system does not compute these values as a computer would, as an arithmetic mean or a correlation. Instead, it extracts these patterns using perceptual proxies; heuristic shortcuts of the visual marks, such as a center of mass or a shape envelope. Understanding which proxies people use would lead to more effective visualizations. We present the results of a series of crowdsourced experiments that measure how powerfully a set of candidate proxies can explain human performance when comparing the mean and range of pairs of data series presented as bar charts. We generated datasets where the correct answer-the series with the larger arithmetic mean or range-was pitted against an “adversarial” series that should be seen as larger if the viewer uses a particular candidate proxy. We used both Bayesian logistic regression models and a robust Bayesian mixed-effects linear model to measure how strongly each adversarial proxy could drive viewers to answer incorrectly and whether different individuals may use different proxies. Finally, we attempt to construct adversarial datasets from scratch, using an iterative crowdsourcing procedure to perform black-box optimization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9238508/","LOCKED","9238508","National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, USA and University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545518","1","Brian D.

"Traffic light detection is crucial for environment perception and decision-making in autonomous driving. State-of-the-art detectors are built upon deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and have exhibited promising performance. However, one looming concern with CNN based detectors is how to thoroughly evaluate the performance of accuracy and robustness before they can be deployed to autonomous vehicles. In this work, we propose a visual analytics system, VATLD, equipped with a disentangled representation learning and semantic adversarial learning, to assess, understand, and improve the accuracy and robustness of traffic light detectors in autonomous driving applications. The disentangled representation learning extracts data semantics to augment human cognition with human-friendly visual summarization, and the semantic adversarial learning efficiently exposes interpretable robustness risks and enables minimal human interaction for actionable insights. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of various performance improvement strategies derived from actionable insights with our visual analytics system, VATLD, and illustrate some practical implications for safety-critical applications in autonomous driving.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9233993/","LOCKED","9233993","Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075500200","1","Liang Gou","37075500200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655716","2","Lincan Zou","37088655716","Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656460","3","Nanxiang Li","37088656460","Robert Bosch GmbH, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655682","4","Michael Hofmann","37088655682","Robert Bosch GmbH, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656316","5","Arvind Kumar Shekar","37088656316","Robert Bosch GmbH, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086090854","6","Axel Wendt","37086090854","Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086048784","7","Liu Ren","37086048784","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030350","271","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9233993/","Traffic light detection","representation learning","semantic adversarial learning","model diagnosing","autonomous driving","","","","","","Detectors","Robustness","Semantics","Autonomous vehicles","Visual analytics","Task analysis","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9233993","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","26","261","VATLD: A Visual Analytics System to Assess, Understand and Improve Traffic Light Detection","27"
"Understanding correlation judgement is important to designing effective visualizations of bivariate data. Prior work on correlation perception has not considered how factors including prior beliefs and uncertainty representation impact such judgements. The present work focuses on the impact of uncertainty communication when judging bivariate visualizations. Specifically, we model how users update their beliefs about variable relationships after seeing a scatterplot with and without uncertainty representation. To model and evaluate the belief updating, we present three studies. Study 1 focuses on a proposed “Line + Cone” visual elicitation method for capturing users' beliefs in an accurate and intuitive fashion. The findings reveal that our proposed method of belief solicitation reduces complexity and accurately captures the users' uncertainty about a range of bivariate relationships. Study 2 leverages the “Line + Cone” elicitation method to measure belief updating on the relationship between different sets of variables when seeing correlation visualization with and without uncertainty representation. We compare changes in users beliefs to the predictions of Bayesian cognitive models which provide normative benchmarks for how users should update their prior beliefs about a relationship in light of observed data. The findings from Study 2 revealed that one of the visualization conditions with uncertainty communication led to users being slightly more confident about their judgement compared to visualization without uncertainty information. Study 3 builds on findings from Study 2 and explores differences in belief update when the bivariate visualization is congruent or incongruent with users' prior belief. Our results highlight the effects of incorporating uncertainty representation, and the potential of measuring belief updating on correlation judgement with Bayesian cognitive models.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9217952/","LOCKED","9217952","University of North Carolina, Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085510179","1","Alireza Karduni","37085510179","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of North Carolina, Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655617","2","Douglas Markant","37088655617","University of North Carolina, Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086557669","3","Ryan Wesslen","37086557669","University of North Carolina, Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606064200","4","Wenwen Dou","37606064200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3029412","988","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9217952/","Information visualization","Bayesian modeling","uncertainty visualizations","correlations","belief elicitation","","","","","","Data visualization","Correlation","Uncertainty","Bayes methods","Cognition","Data models","Visualization","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9217952","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","27","978","A Bayesian cognition approach for belief updating of correlation judgement through uncertainty visualizations","27"
"A fundamental part of data visualization is transforming data to map abstract information onto visual attributes. While this abstraction is a powerful basis for data visualization, the connection between the representation and the original underlying data (i.e., what the quantities and measurements actually correspond with in reality) can be lost. On the other hand, virtual reality (VR) is being increasingly used to represent real and abstract models as natural experiences to users. In this work, we explore the potential of using VR to help restore the basic understanding of units and measures that are often abstracted away in data visualization in an approach we call data visceralization. By building VR prototypes as design probes, we identify key themes and factors for data visceralization. We do this first through a critical reflection by the authors, then by involving external participants. We find that data visceralization is an engaging way of understanding the qualitative aspects of physical measures and their real-life form, which complements analytical and quantitative understanding commonly gained from data visualization. However, data visceralization is most effective when there is a one-to-one mapping between data and representation, with transformations such as scaling affecting this understanding. We conclude with a discussion of future directions for data visceralization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229242/","LOCKED","9229242","Monash University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656926","1","Benjamin Lee","37088656926","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Microsoft Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656165","2","Dave Brown","37088656165","Microsoft Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","3","Bongshin Lee","37293389400","ENAC, French Civil Aviation University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017336200","4","Christophe Hurter","38017336200","Microsoft Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37585786500","5","Steven Drucker","37585786500","Monash University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326161000","6","Tim Dwyer","37326161000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030435","1105","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229242/","Data visceralization","virtual reality","exploratory study","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Prototypes","Probes","Virtual reality","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","Videos","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9229242","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","28","1095","Data Visceralization: Enabling Deeper Understanding of Data Using Virtual Reality","27"
"We present a systematic review on three comparative layouts-juxtaposition, superposition, and explicit-encoding-which are information visualization (InfoVis) layouts designed to support comparison tasks. For the last decade, these layouts have served as fundamental idioms in designing many visualization systems. However, we found that the layouts have been used with inconsistent terms and confusion, and the lessons from previous studies are fragmented. The goal of our research is to distill the results from previous studies into a consistent and reusable framework. We review 127 research papers, including 15 papers with quantitative user studies, which employed comparative layouts. We first alleviate the ambiguous boundaries in the design space of comparative layouts by suggesting lucid terminology (e.g., chart-wise and item-wise juxtaposition). We then identify the diverse aspects of comparative layouts, such as the advantages and concerns of using each layout in the real-world scenarios and researchers' approaches to overcome the concerns. Building our knowledge on top of the initial insights gained from the Gleicher et al.'s survey [19], we elaborate on relevant empirical evidence that we distilled from our survey (e.g., the actual effectiveness of the layouts in different study settings) and identify novel facets that the original work did not cover (e.g., the familiarity of the layouts to people). Finally, we show the consistent and contradictory results on the performance of comparative layouts and offer practical implications for using the layouts by suggesting trade-offs and seven actionable guidelines.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9223736/","LOCKED","9223736","Harvard Medical School","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088658221","1","Sehi LYi","37088658221","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sungkyunkwan University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088661844","2","Jaemin Jo","37088661844","Seoul National University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37422552700","3","Jinwook Seo","37422552700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030419","1535","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9223736/","Comparative layout","visual comparison","literature review","juxtaposition","superposition","explicit-encoding","","","","","Layout","Visualization","Task analysis","Bars","Heating systems","Data visualization","Guidelines","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9223736","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","29","1525","Comparative Layouts Revisited: Design Space, Guidelines, and Future Directions","27"
"Many statistical learning models hold an assumption that the training data and the future unlabeled data are drawn from the same distribution. However, this assumption is difficult to fulfill in real-world scenarios and creates barriers in reusing existing labels from similar application domains. Transfer Learning is intended to relax this assumption by modeling relationships between domains, and is often applied in deep learning applications to reduce the demand for labeled data and training time. Despite recent advances in exploring deep learning models with visual analytics tools, little work has explored the issue of explaining and diagnosing the knowledge transfer process between deep learning models. In this paper, we present a visual analytics framework for the multi-level exploration of the transfer learning processes when training deep neural networks. Our framework establishes a multi-aspect design to explain how the learned knowledge from the existing model is transferred into the new learning task when training deep neural networks. Based on a comprehensive requirement and task analysis, we employ descriptive visualization with performance measures and detailed inspections of model behaviors from the statistical, instance, feature, and model structure levels. We demonstrate our framework through two case studies on image classification by fine-tuning AlexNets to illustrate how analysts can utilize our framework.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9219240/","LOCKED","9219240","Arizona State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101494","1","Yuxin Ma","37087101494","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Arizona State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088659496","2","Arlen Fan","37088659496","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088657912","3","Jingrui He","37088657912","Samsung Research America","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086599085","4","Arun Reddy Nelakurthi","37086599085","Arizona State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","5","Ross Maciejewski","37396008400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028888","1395","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9219240/","Transfer learning","deep learning","visual analytics","","","","","","","","Analytical models","Visual analytics","Task analysis","Deep learning","Data models","Neurons","Predictive models","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9219240","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","30","1385","A Visual Analytics Framework for Explaining and Diagnosing Transfer Learning Processes","27"
"We present a new technique for the rapid modeling and construction of scientifically accurate mesoscale biological models. The resulting 3D models are based on a few 2D microscopy scans and the latest knowledge available about the biological entity, represented as a set of geometric relationships. Our new visual-programming technique is based on statistical and rule-based modeling approaches that are rapid to author, fast to construct, and easy to revise. From a few 2D microscopy scans, we determine the statistical properties of various structural aspects, such as the outer membrane shape, the spatial properties, and the distribution characteristics of the macromolecular elements on the membrane. This information is utilized in the construction of the 3D model. Once all the imaging evidence is incorporated into the model, additional information can be incorporated by interactively defining the rules that spatially characterize the rest of the biological entity, such as mutual interactions among macromolecules, and their distances and orientations relative to other structures. These rules are defined through an intuitive 3D interactive visualization as a visual-programming feedback loop. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on a use case of the modeling procedure of the SARS-CoV-2 virion ultrastructure. This atomistic model, which we present here, can steer biological research to new promising directions in our efforts to fight the spread of the virus.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224865/","CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

"Rapidly growing data sizes of scientific simulations pose significant challenges for interactive visualization and analysis techniques. In this work, we propose a compact probabilistic representation to interactively visualize large scattered datasets. In contrast to previous approaches that represent blocks of volumetric data using probability distributions, we model clusters of arbitrarily structured multivariate data. In detail, we discuss how to efficiently represent and store a high-dimensional distribution for each cluster. We observe that it suffices to consider low-dimensional marginal distributions for two or three data dimensions at a time to employ common visual analysis techniques. Based on this observation, we represent high-dimensional distributions by combinations of low-dimensional Gaussian mixture models. We discuss the application of common interactive visual analysis techniques to this representation. In particular, we investigate several frequency-based views, such as density plots in 1D and 2D, density-based parallel coordinates, and a time histogram. We visualize the uncertainty introduced by the representation, discuss a level-of-detail mechanism, and explicitly visualize outliers. Furthermore, we propose a spatial visualization by splatting anisotropic 3D Gaussians for which we derive a closed-form solution. Lastly, we describe the application of brushing and linking to this clustered representation. Our evaluation on several large, real-world datasets demonstrates the scaling of our approach.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222076/","LOCKED","9222076","Karlsruhe Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086172474","1","Tobias Rapp","37086172474","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Karlsruhe Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102300","2","Christoph Peters","37087102300","Karlsruhe Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395703400","3","Carsten Dachsbacher","37395703400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030379","1590","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222076/","interactive visual analysis","probabilistic data summaries","multivariate data","scattered data","Gaussian mixture models","Gaussian rendering","","","","","Data visualization","Probabilistic logic","Data models","Visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Gaussian mixture model","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222076","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","32","1580","Visual Analysis of Large Multivariate Scattered Data using Clustering and Probabilistic Summaries","27"
"Over the past decades, classification models have proven to be essential machine learning tools given their potential and applicability in various domains. In these years, the north of the majority of the researchers had been to improve quantitative metrics, notwithstanding the lack of information about models' decisions such metrics convey. This paradigm has recently shifted, and strategies beyond tables and numbers to assist in interpreting models' decisions are increasing in importance. Part of this trend, visualization techniques have been extensively used to support classification models' interpretability, with a significant focus on rule-based models. Despite the advances, the existing approaches present limitations in terms of visual scalability, and the visualization of large and complex models, such as the ones produced by the Random Forest (RF) technique, remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose Explainable Matrix (ExMatrix), a novel visualization method for RF interpretability that can handle models with massive quantities of rules. It employs a simple yet powerful matrix-like visual metaphor, where rows are rules, columns are features, and cells are rules predicates, enabling the analysis of entire models and auditing classification results. ExMatrix applicability is confirmed via different examples, showing how it can be used in practice to promote RF models interpretability.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222255/","LOCKED","9222255","Federal Institute of São Paulo (IFSP) and University of São Paulo (USP), Brzil","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38255637000","1","Mário Popolin Neto","38255637000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dalhousie University, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590969400","2","Fernando V.

"Taylor-Couette flow (TCF) is the turbulent fluid motion created between two concentric and independently rotating cylinders. It has been heavily researched in fluid mechanics thanks to the various nonlinear dynamical phenomena that are exhibited in the flow. As many dense coherent structures overlap each other in TCF, it is challenging to isolate and visualize them, especially when the cylinder rotation ratio is changing. Previous approaches rely on 2D cross sections to study TCF due to its simplicity, which cannot provide the complete information of TCF. In the meantime, standard visualization techniques, such as volume rendering / iso-surfacing of certain attributes and the placement of integral curves/surfaces, usually produce cluttered visualization. To address this challenge and to support domain experts in the analysis of TCF, we developed a visualization framework to separate large-scale structures from the dense, small-scale structures and provide an effective visual representation of these structures. Instead of using a single physical attribute as the standard approach which cannot efficiently separate structures in different scales for TCF, we adapt the feature level-set method to combine multiple attributes and use them as a filter to separate large- and small-scale structures. To visualize these structures, we apply the iso-surface extraction on the kernel density estimate of the distance field generated from the feature level-set. The proposed methods successfully reveal 3D large-scale coherent structures of TCF with different control parameter settings, which are difficult to achieve with the conventional methods.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216538/","LOCKED","9216538","University of Houston","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087128206","1","Duong B.

"Causality is crucial to understanding the mechanisms behind complex systems and making decisions that lead to intended outcomes. Event sequence data is widely collected from many real-world processes, such as electronic health records, web clickstreams, and financial transactions, which transmit a great deal of information reflecting the causal relations among event types. Unfortunately, recovering causalities from observational event sequences is challenging, as the heterogeneous and high-dimensional event variables are often connected to rather complex underlying event excitation mechanisms that are hard to infer from limited observations. Many existing automated causal analysis techniques suffer from poor explainability and fail to include an adequate amount of human knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a visual analytics method for recovering causalities in event sequence data. We extend the Granger causality analysis algorithm on Hawkes processes to incorporate user feedback into causal model refinement. The visualization system includes an interactive causal analysis framework that supports bottom-up causal exploration, iterative causal verification and refinement, and causal comparison through a set of novel visualizations and interactions. We report two forms of evaluation: a quantitative evaluation of the model improvements resulting from the user-feedback mechanism, and a qualitative evaluation through case studies in different application domains to demonstrate the usefulness of the system.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222294/","LOCKED","9222294","iDVx Lab at Tongji University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547579","1","Zhuochen Jin","37086547579","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","iDVx Lab at Tongji University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547434","2","Shunan Guo","37086547434","iDVx Lab at Tongji University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087408715","3","Nan Chen","37087408715","University of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","4","Daniel Weiskopf","37268045000","University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601397400","5","David Gotz","37601397400","iDVx Lab at Tongji University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604309600","6","Nan Cao","37604309600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030465","1352","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222294/","Event sequence data","causality analysis","visual analytics","","","","","","","","Analytical models","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Data models","Layout","Computational modeling","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222294","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","35","1343","Visual Causality Analysis of Event Sequence Data","27"
"Numerous sampling strategies have been proposed to simplify large-scale networks for highly readable visualizations. It is of great challenge to preserve contextual structures formed by nodes and edges with tight relationships in a sampled graph, because they are easily overlooked during the process of sampling due to their irregular distribution and immunity to scale. In this paper, a new graph sampling method is proposed oriented to the preservation of contextual structures. We first utilize a graph representation learning (GRL) model to transform nodes into vectors so that the contextual structures in a network can be effectively extracted and organized. Then, we propose a multi-objective blue noise sampling model to select a subset of nodes in the vectorized space to preserve contextual structures with the retention of relative data and cluster densities in addition to those features of significance, such as bridging nodes and graph connections. We also design a set of visual interfaces enabling users to interactively conduct context-aware sampling, visually compare results with various sampling strategies, and deeply explore large networks. Case studies and quantitative comparisons based on real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method in the abstraction and exploration of large networks.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224191/","LOCKED","9224191","School of Information, Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024388200","1","Zhiguang Zhou","38024388200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","School of Information, Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086926167","2","Chen Shi","37086926167","School of Information, Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655454","3","Xilong Shen","37088655454","School of Information, Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656013","4","Lihong Cai","37088656013","School of Information, Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086949980","5","Haoxuan Wang","37086949980","School of Information, Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655591","6","Yuhua Liu","37088655591","Central South University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085336513","7","Ying Zhao","37085336513","State Key Lab of CAD & CGZhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","8","Wei Chen","37291847800","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030440","1719","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224191/","Graph sampling","Graph representation learning","Blue noise sampling","Graph evaluation","","","","","","","Visualization","Measurement","Sampling methods","Context modeling","Task analysis","Clutter","Layout","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9224191","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","36","1709","Context-aware Sampling of Large Networks via Graph Representation Learning","27"
"Git metadata contains rich information for developers to understand the overall context of a large software development project. Thus it can help new developers, managers, and testers understand the history of development without needing to dig into a large pile of unfamiliar source code. However, the current tools for Git visualization are not adequate to analyze and explore the metadata: They focus mainly on improving the usability of Git commands instead of on helping users understand the development history. Furthermore, they do not scale for large and complex Git commit graphs, which can play an important role in understanding the overall development history. In this paper, we present Githru, an interactive visual analytics system that enables developers to effectively understand the context of development history through the interactive exploration of Git metadata. We design an interactive visual encoding idiom to represent a large Git graph in a scalable manner while preserving the topological structures in the Git graph. To enable scalable exploration of a large Git commit graph, we propose novel techniques (graph reconstruction, clustering, and Context-Preserving Squash Merge (CSM) methods) to abstract a large-scale Git commit graph. Based on these Git commit graph abstraction techniques, Githru provides an interactive summary view to help users gain an overview of the development history and a comparison view in which users can compare different clusters of commits. The efficacy of Githru has been demonstrated by case studies with domain experts using real-world, in-house datasets from a large software development team at a major international IT company. A controlled user study with 12 developers comparing Githru to previous tools also confirms the effectiveness of Githru in terms of task completion time.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222261/","CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

"We propose a new approach-called PK-clustering-to help social scientists create meaningful clusters in social networks. Many clustering algorithms exist but most social scientists find them difficult to understand, and tools do not provide any guidance to choose algorithms, or to evaluate results taking into account the prior knowledge of the scientists. Our work introduces a new clustering approach and a visual analytics user interface that address this issue. It is based on a process that 1) captures the prior knowledge of the scientists as a set of incomplete clusters, 2) runs multiple clustering algorithms (similarly to clustering ensemble methods), 3) visualizes the results of all the algorithms ranked and summarized by how well each algorithm matches the prior knowledge, 4) evaluates the consensus between user-selected algorithms and 5) allows users to review details and iteratively update the acquired knowledge. We describe our approach using an initial functional prototype, then provide two examples of use and early feedback from social scientists. We believe our clustering approach offers a novel constructive method to iteratively build knowledge while avoiding being overly influenced by the results of often randomly selected black-box clustering algorithms.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9237999/","LOCKED","9237999","Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LRI, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656586","1","Alexis Pister","37088656586","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Bari, Italy","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37660869300","2","Paolo Buono","37660869300","Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LRI, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","3","Jean-Daniel Fekete","37407972900","Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LRI, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283026800","4","Catherine Plaisant","37283026800","Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LRI, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085717328","5","Paola Valdivia","37085717328","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030347","1785","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9237999/","Social network analysis","network visualization","clustering","mixed-initiative","prior knowledge","user interface","","","","","Clustering algorithms","Social networking (online)","Tools","Visualization","Heuristic algorithms","Clustering methods","Inference algorithms","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9237999","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","38","1775","Integrating Prior Knowledge in Mixed-Initiative Social Network Clustering","27"
"Empirical models, fitted to data from observations, are often used in natural sciences to describe physical behaviour and support discoveries. However, with more complex models, the regression of parameters quickly becomes insufficient, requiring a visual parameter space analysis to understand and optimize the models. In this work, we present a design study for building a model describing atmospheric convection. We present a mixed-initiative approach to visually guided modelling, integrating an interactive visual parameter space analysis with partial automatic parameter optimization. Our approach includes a new, semi-automatic technique called IsoTrotting, where we optimize the procedure by navigating along isocontours of the model. We evaluate the model with unique observational data of atmospheric convection based on flight trajectories of paragliders.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9233392/","LOCKED","9233392","University of Bergen","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100125","1","Juraj Palenik","37087100125","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Bergen","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656576","2","Thomas Spengler","37088656576","University of Bergen","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","3","Helwig Hauser","37274158800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030389","784","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9233392/","visual parameter space exploration","scientific modelling","atmospheric convection","","","","","","","","Atmospheric modeling","Computational modeling","Analytical models","Data models","Convection","Visualization","Meteorology","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9233392","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","39","775","IsoTrotter: Visually Guided Empirical Modelling of Atmospheric Convection","27"
"In this work we propose the combination of large interactive displays with personal head-mounted Augmented Reality (AR) for information visualization to facilitate data exploration and analysis. Even though large displays provide more display space, they are challenging with regard to perception, effective multi-user support, and managing data density and complexity. To address these issues and illustrate our proposed setup, we contribute an extensive design space comprising first, the spatial alignment of display, visualizations, and objects in AR space. Next, we discuss which parts of a visualization can be augmented. Finally, we analyze how AR can be used to display personal views in order to show additional information and to minimize the mutual disturbance of data analysts. Based on this conceptual foundation, we present a number of exemplary techniques for extending visualizations with AR and discuss their relation to our design space. We further describe how these techniques address typical visualization problems that we have identified during our literature research. To examine our concepts, we introduce a generic AR visualization framework as well as a prototype implementing several example techniques. In order to demonstrate their potential, we further present a use case walkthrough in which we analyze a movie data set. From these experiences, we conclude that the contributed techniques can be useful in exploring and understanding multivariate data.

"Mode surfaces are the generalization of degenerate curves and neutral surfaces, which constitute 3D symmetric tensor field topology. Efficient analysis and visualization of mode surfaces can provide additional insight into not only degenerate curves and neutral surfaces, but also how these features transition into each other. Moreover, the geometry and topology of mode surfaces can help domain scientists better understand the tensor fields in their applications. Existing mode surface extraction methods can miss features in the surfaces. Moreover, the mode surfaces extracted from neighboring cells have gaps, which make their subsequent analysis difficult. In this paper, we provide novel analysis on the topological structures of mode surfaces, including a common parameterization of all mode surfaces of a tensor field using 2D asymmetric tensors. This allows us to not only better understand the structures in mode surfaces and their interactions with degenerate curves and neutral surfaces, but also develop an efficient algorithm to seamlessly extract mode surfaces, including neutral surfaces. The seamless mode surfaces enable efficient analysis of their geometric structures, such as the principal curvature directions. We apply our analysis and visualization to a number of solid mechanics data sets.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224154/","LOCKED","9224154","School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100795","1","Botong Qu","37087100795","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086255270","2","Lawrence Roy","37086255270","School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085665492","3","Yue Zhang","37085665492","School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398562200","4","Eugene Zhang","37398562200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030431","592","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224154/","Tensor field visualization","tensor field topology","traceless tensors","degenerate curve extraction","neutral surface extraction","mode surface extraction","","","","","Tensors","Surface treatment","Feature extraction","Topology","Three-dimensional displays","Faces","Two dimensional displays","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9224154","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","41","583","Mode Surfaces of Symmetric Tensor Fields: Topological Analysis and Seamless Extraction","27"
"Multiverse analysis is an approach to data analysis in which all “reasonable” analytic decisions are evaluated in parallel and interpreted collectively, in order to foster robustness and transparency. However, specifying a multiverse is demanding because analysts must manage myriad variants from a cross-product of analytic decisions, and the results require nuanced interpretation. We contribute Baba: an integrated domain-specific language (DSL) and visual analysis system for authoring and reviewing multiverse analyses. With the Boba DSL, analysts write the shared portion of analysis code only once, alongside local variations defining alternative decisions, from which the compiler generates a multiplex of scripts representing all possible analysis paths. The Boba Visualizer provides linked views of model results and the multiverse decision space to enable rapid, systematic assessment of consequential decisions and robustness, including sampling uncertainty and model fit. We demonstrate Boba's utility through two data analysis case studies, and reflect on challenges and design opportunities for multiverse analysis software.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216579/","LOCKED","9216579","University of Washington","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655677","1","Yang Liu","37088655677","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Washington","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543362","2","Alex Kale","37086543362","University of Washington","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086331530","3","Tim Althoff","37086331530","University of Washington","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550791300","4","Jeffrey Heer","37550791300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028985","1763","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216579/","Multiverse Analysis","Statistical Analysis","Analytic Decisions","Reproducibility","","","","","","","Tools","Analytical models","Robustness","DSL","Data models","Computational modeling","Load modeling","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9216579","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","42","1753","Boba: Authoring and Visualizing Multiverse Analyses","27"
"A Bayesian view of data interpretation suggests that a visualization user should update their existing beliefs about a parameter's value in accordance with the amount of information about the parameter value captured by the new observations. Extending recent work applying Bayesian models to understand and evaluate belief updating from visualizations, we show how the predictions of Bayesian inference can be used to guide more rational belief updating. We design a Bayesian inference-assisted uncertainty analogy that numerically relates uncertainty in observed data to the user's subjective uncertainty, and a posterior visualization that prescribes how a user should update their beliefs given their prior beliefs and the observed data. In a pre-registered experiment on 4,800 people, we find that when a newly observed data sample is relatively small (N=158), both techniques reliably improve people's Bayesian updating on average compared to the current best practice of visualizing uncertainty in the observed data. For large data samples (N=5208), where people's updated beliefs tend to deviate more strongly from the prescriptions of a Bayesian model, we find evidence that the effectiveness of the two forms of Bayesian assistance may depend on people's proclivity toward trusting the source of the data. We discuss how our results provide insight into individual processes of belief updating and subjective uncertainty, and how understanding these aspects of interpretation paves the way for more sophisticated interactive visualizations for analysis and communication.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216507/","LOCKED","9216507","University of Washington","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086229639","1","Yea-Seul Kim","37086229639","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Northwestern University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655426","2","Paula Kayongo","37088655426","University of Pennsylvania","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655449","3","Madeleine Grunde-McLaughlin","37088655449","University of Washington","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016234500","4","Jessica Hullman","38016234500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028984","999","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216507/","Bayesian cognition","Belief updating","Uncertainty visualization","Adaptive visualization","","","","","","","Bayes methods","Data visualization","Uncertainty","Data models","Cognition","Mathematical model","Predictive models","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9216507","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","43","989","Bayesian-Assisted Inference from Visualized Data","27"
"Program developers spend significant time on optimizing and tuning programs. During this iterative process, they apply optimizations, analyze the resulting code, and modify the compilation until they are satisfied. Understanding what the compiler did with the code is crucial to this process but is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Users need to navigate through thousands of lines of binary code and correlate it to source code concepts to understand the results of the compilation and to identify optimizations. We present a design study in collaboration with program developers and performance analysts. Our collaborators work with various artifacts related to the program such as binary code, source code, control flow graphs, and call graphs. Through interviews, feedback, and pair-analytics sessions, we analyzed their tasks and workflow. Based on this task analysis and through a human-centric design process, we designed a visual analytics system Compilation Navigator (CcNav) to aid exploration of the effects of compiler optimizations on the program. CcNav provides a streamlined workflow and a unified context that integrates disparate artifacts. CcNav supports consistent interactions across all the artifacts making it easy to correlate binary code with source code concepts. CcNav enables users to navigate and filter large binary code to identify and summarize optimizations such as inlining, vectorization, loop unrolling, and code hoisting. We evaluate CcNav through guided sessions and semi-structured interviews. We reflect on our design process, particularly the immersive elements, and on the transferability of design studies through our experience with a previous design study on program analysis.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222367/","LOCKED","9222367","University of Arizona","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655856","1","Sabin Devkota","37088655856","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LLNL","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655834","2","Pascal Aschwanden","37088655834","LLNL","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656504","3","Adam Kunen","37088656504","LLNL","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37901041300","4","Matthew Legendre","37901041300","University of Arizona","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490580100","5","Katherine E.

"The daily routine of criminal investigators consists of a thorough analysis of highly complex and heterogeneous data of crime cases. Such data can consist of case descriptions, testimonies, criminal networks, spatial and temporal information, and virtually any other data that is relevant for the case. Criminal investigators work under heavy time pressure to analyze the data for relationships, propose and verify several hypotheses, and derive conclusions, while the data can be incomplete or inconsistent and is changed and updated throughout the investigation, as new findings are added to the case. Based on a four-year intense collaboration with criminalists, we present a conceptual design for a visual tool supporting the investigation workflow and Visilant, a web-based tool for the exploration and analysis of criminal data guided by the proposed design. Visilant aims to support namely the exploratory part of the investigation pipeline, from case overview, through exploration and hypothesis generation, to the case presentation. Visilant tracks the reasoning process and as the data is changing, it informs investigators which hypotheses are affected by the data change and should be revised. The tool was evaluated by senior criminology experts within two sessions and their feedback is summarized in the paper. Additional supplementary material contains the technical details and exemplary case study.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222116/","LOCKED","9222116","Masaryk University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656049","1","Kristína Zákopčanová","37088656049","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Masaryk University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656767","2","Marko Řeháček","37088656767","Masaryk University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656664","3","Jozef Bátrna","37088656664","Masaryk University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656562","4","Daniel Plakinger","37088656562","University of Bergen and Rainfall AS Bergen","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085901852","5","Sergej Stoppel","37085901852","Masaryk University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085711031","6","Barbora Kozlíková","37085711031","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030356","890","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222116/","Criminal investigation","visualization","network","exploration","interaction","tracking","diagram","","","","Visualization","Tools","Collaboration","Data visualization","Databases","Cognition","Computer crime","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222116","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","45","881","Visilant: Visual Support for the Exploration and Analytical Process Tracking in Criminal Investigations","27"
"Shaded relief is an effective method for visualising terrain on topographic maps, especially when the direction of illumination is adapted locally to emphasise individual terrain features. However, digital shading algorithms are unable to fully match the expressiveness of hand-crafted masterpieces, which are created through a laborious process by highly specialised cartographers. We replicate hand-drawn relief shading using U-Net neural networks. The deep neural networks are trained with manual shaded relief images of the Swiss topographic map series and terrain models of the same area. The networks generate shaded relief that closely resemble hand-drawn shaded relief art. The networks learn essential design principles from manual relief shading such as removing unnecessary terrain details, locally adjusting the illumination direction to accentuate individual terrain features, and varying brightness to emphasise larger landforms. Neural network shadings are generated from digital elevation models in a few seconds, and a study with 18 relief shading experts found that they are of high quality.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222263/","LOCKED","9222263","Monash University, Melbourne","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38488917300","1","Bernhard Jenny","38488917300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Cartography and Geoinformation, ETH, Zurich","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077839500","2","Magnus Heitzler","37077839500","Monash University, Melbourne","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656749","3","Dilpreet Singh","37088656749","Institute of Cartography and Geoinformation, ETH, Zurich","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656069","4","Marianna Farmakis-Serebryakova","37088656069","Monash University, Melbourne","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656482","5","Jeffery Chieh Liu","37088656482","Institute of Cartography and Geoinformation, ETH, Zurich","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656932","6","Lorenz Hurni","37088656932","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030456","1235","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222263/","Relief shading","shaded relief","hillshade","neural rendering","illustrative visualisation","image-to-image translation","","","","","Neural networks","Lighting","Manuals","Rendering (computer graphics)","Digital elevation models","Computational modeling","Visualization","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222263","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","46","1225","Cartographic Relief Shading with Neural Networks","27"
"Bar charts are among the most frequently used visualizations, in part because their position encoding leads them to convey data values precisely. Yet reproductions of single bars or groups of bars within a graph can be biased. Curiously, some previous work found that this bias resulted in an overestimation of reproduced data values, while other work found an underestimation. Across three empirical studies, we offer an explanation for these conflicting findings: this discrepancy is a consequence of the differing aspect ratios of the tested bar marks. Viewers are biased to remember a bar mark as being more similar to a prototypical square, leading to an overestimation of bars with a wide aspect ratio, and an underestimation of bars with a tall aspect ratio. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that the aspect ratio of the bar marks indeed influenced the direction of this bias. Experiment 3 confirmed that this pattern of misestimation bias was present for reproductions from memory, suggesting that this bias may arise when comparing values across sequential displays or views. We describe additional visualization designs that might be prone to this bias beyond bar charts (e.g., Mekko charts and treemaps), and speculate that other visual channels might hold similar biases toward prototypical values.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222047/","LOCKED","9222047","Northwestern University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099982","1","Cristina R.

"Dynamic networks can be challenging to analyze visually, especially if they span a large time range during which new nodes and edges can appear and disappear. Although it is straightforward to provide interfaces for visualization that represent multiple states of the network (i.e., multiple timeslices) either simultaneously (e.g., through small multiples) or interactively (e.g., through interactive animation), these interfaces might not support tasks in which disjoint timeslices need to be compared. Since these tasks are key for understanding the dynamic aspects of the network, understanding which interactive visualizations best support these tasks is important. We present the results of a series of laboratory experiments comparing two traditional approaches (small multiples and interactive animation), with a more recent approach based on interactive timeslicing. The tasks were performed on a large display through a touch interface. Participants completed 24 trials of three tasks with all techniques. The results show that interactive timeslicing brings benefit when comparing distant points in time, but less benefits when analyzing contiguous intervals of time.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222301/","LOCKED","9222301","Dept. of Computer Science, Swansea University, Swansea University Medical School, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655776","1","Alexandra Lee","37088655776","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dept. of Computer Science, Swansea University, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396011500","2","Daniel Archambault","37396011500","Dept. of Computer Science, University of Victoria, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086329318","3","Miguel A.

"In recent years, a wide variety of automated machine learning (AutoML) methods have been proposed to generate end-to-end ML pipelines. While these techniques facilitate the creation of models, given their black-box nature, the complexity of the underlying algorithms, and the large number of pipelines they derive, they are difficult for developers to debug. It is also challenging for machine learning experts to select an AutoML system that is well suited for a given problem. In this paper, we present the Pipeline Profiler, an interactive visualization tool that allows the exploration and comparison of the solution space of machine learning (ML) pipelines produced by AutoML systems. PipelineProfiler is integrated with Jupyter Notebook and can be combined with common data science tools to enable a rich set of analyses of the ML pipelines, providing users a better understanding of the algorithms that generated them as well as insights into how they can be improved. We demonstrate the utility of our tool through use cases where PipelineProfiler is used to better understand and improve a real-world AutoML system. Furthermore, we validate our approach by presenting a detailed analysis of a think-aloud experiment with six data scientists who develop and evaluate AutoML tools.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222086/","LOCKED","9222086","New York University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085831490","1","Jorge Piazentin Ono","37085831490","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655635","2","Sonia Castelo","37088655635","New York University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656656","3","Roque Lopez","37088656656","New York University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38267713800","4","Enrico Bertini","38267713800","New York University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283149600","5","Juliana Freire","37283149600","New York University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086888182","6","Claudio Silva","37086888182","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030361","400","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222086/","Automatic Machine Learning","Pipeline Visualization","Model Evaluation","","","","","","","","Pipelines","Tools","Visual analytics","Machine learning","Data visualization","Search problems","Correlation","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222086","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","49","390","PipelineProfiler: A Visual Analytics Tool for the Exploration of AutoML Pipelines","27"
"Pathogen outbreaks (i.e., outbreaks of bacteria and viruses) in hospitals can cause high mortality rates and increase costs for hospitals significantly. An outbreak is generally noticed when the number of infected patients rises above an endemic level or the usual prevalence of a pathogen in a defined population. Reconstructing transmission pathways back to the source of an outbreak - the patient zero or index patient - requires the analysis of microbiological data and patient contacts. This is often manually completed by infection control experts. We present a novel visual analytics approach to support the analysis of transmission pathways, patient contacts, the progression of the outbreak, and patient timelines during hospitalization. Infection control experts applied our solution to a real outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae in a large German hospital. Using our system, our experts were able to scale the analysis of transmission pathways to longer time intervals (i.e., several years of data instead of days) and across a larger number of wards. Also, the system is able to reduce the analysis time from days to hours. In our final study, feedback from twenty-five experts from seven German hospitals provides evidence that our solution brings significant benefits for analyzing outbreaks.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9286903/","LOCKED","9286903","TU Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656048","1","T.

"To address the problem of ever-growing scientific data sizes making data movement a major hindrance to analysis, we introduce a novel encoding for scalar fields: a unified tree of resolution and precision, specifically constructed so that valid cuts correspond to sensible approximations of the original field in the precision-resolution space. Furthermore, we introduce a highly flexible encoding of such trees that forms a parameterized family of data hierarchies. We discuss how different parameter choices lead to different trade-offs in practice, and show how specific choices result in known data representation schemes such as zfp [52], idx [58], and jpeg2000 [76]. Finally, we provide system-level details and empirical evidence on how such hierarchies facilitate common approximate queries with minimal data movement and time, using real-world data sets ranging from a few gigabytes to nearly a terabyte in size. Experiments suggest that our new strategy of combining reductions in resolution and precision is competitive with state-of-the-art compression techniques with respect to data quality, while being significantly more flexible and orders of magnitude faster, and requiring significantly reduced resources.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222049/","LOCKED","9222049","SCI Institute, University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086323906","1","Duong Hoang","37086323906","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Tulane Universiy","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38288824300","2","Brian Summa","38288824300","Lawrence Livermore National LaboratoryCenter for Applied Scientific Computing","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37863152400","3","Harsh Bhatia","37863152400","Lawrence Livermore National LaboratoryCenter for Applied Scientific Computing","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269320000","4","Peter Lindstrom","37269320000","SCI Institute, University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085718422","5","Pavol Klacansky","37085718422","SCI Institute, University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085735276","6","Will Usher","37085735276","Lawrence Livermore National LaboratoryCenter for Applied Scientific Computing","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564112000","7","Peer-Timo Bremer","37564112000","SCI Institute, University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284312600","8","Valerio Pascucci","37284312600","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030381","613","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222049/","scalar field","large-scale data","data compression","multiresolution","wavelet transform","coarse approximation","","","","","Decoding","Spatial resolution","Layout","Wavelet transforms","Encoding","Data models","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222049","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","51","603","Efficient and Flexible Hierarchical Data Layouts for a Unified Encoding of Scalar Field Precision and Resolution","27"
"The fundamental motivation of the proposed work is to present a new visualization-guided computing paradigm to combine direct 3D volume processing and volume rendered clues for effective 3D exploration. For example, extracting and visualizing microstructures in-vivo have been a long-standing challenging problem. However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive public and real patient (micro- )cerebrovascular image datasets. The application of this accurate segmentation and visualization of sparse and complicated 3D microvascular structure facilitated by our method demonstrates the potential in a powerful MR arteriogram and venogram diagnosis of vascular disease.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222053/","LOCKED","9222053","Department of Radiology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101985","1","Yifan Wang","37087101985","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655896","2","Guoli Yan","37088655896","Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656650","3","Haikuan Zhu","37088656650","Department of Radiology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656730","4","Sagar Buch","37088656730","Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656799","5","Ying Wang","37088656799","Department of Radiology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37372968700","6","Ewart Mark Haacke","37372968700","Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285799200","7","Jing Hua","37285799200","Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085891560","8","Zichun Zhong","37085891560","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030374","1311","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222053/","Deep neural network","3D cerebrovascular segmentation and visualization","maximum intensity projection (MIP)","joint embedding","","","","","","","Three-dimensional displays","Image segmentation","Two dimensional displays","Data visualization","Deep learning","Rendering (computer graphics)","Feature extraction","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222053","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","52","1301","VC-Net: Deep Volume-Composition Networks for Segmentation and Visualization of Highly Sparse and Noisy Image Data","27"
"Segmenting biologging time series of animals on multiple temporal scales is an essential step that requires complex techniques with careful parameterization and possibly cross-domain expertise. Yet, there is a lack of visual-interactive tools that strongly support such multi-scale segmentation. To close this gap, we present our MultiSegVA platform for interactively defining segmentation techniques and parameters on multiple temporal scales. MultiSegVA primarily contributes tailored, visual-interactive means and visual analytics paradigms for segmenting unlabeled time series on multiple scales. Further, to flexibly compose the multi-scale segmentation, the platform contributes a new visual query language that links a variety of segmentation techniques. To illustrate our approach, we present a domain-oriented set of segmentation techniques derived in collaboration with movement ecologists. We demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of MultiSegVA in two real-world use cases from movement ecology, related to behavior analysis after environment-aware segmentation, and after progressive clustering. Expert feedback from movement ecologists shows the effectiveness of tailored visual-interactive means and visual analytics paradigms at segmenting multi-scale data, enabling them to perform semantically meaningful analyses. A third use case demonstrates that MultiSegVA is generalizable to other domains.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224197/","LOCKED","9224197","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088585538","1","Philipp Meschenmoser","37088585538","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233607000","2","Juri F.

"Existing interactive visualization tools for deep learning are mostly applied to the training, debugging, and refinement of neural network models working on natural images. However, visual analytics tools are lacking for the specific application of x-ray image classification with multiple structural attributes. In this paper, we present an interactive system for domain scientists to visually study the multiple attributes learning models applied to x-ray scattering images. It allows domain scientists to interactively explore this important type of scientific images in embedded spaces that are defined on the model prediction output, the actual labels, and the discovered feature space of neural networks. Users are allowed to flexibly select instance images, their clusters, and compare them regarding the specified visual representation of attributes. The exploration is guided by the manifestation of model performance related to mutual relationships among attributes, which often affect the learning accuracy and effectiveness. The system thus supports domain scientists to improve the training dataset and model, find questionable attributes labels, and identify outlier images or spurious data clusters. Case studies and scientists feedback demonstrate its functionalities and usefulness.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9240062/","LOCKED","9240062","Kent State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655389","1","Xinyi Huang","37088655389","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Kent State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085681542","2","Suphanut Jamonnak","37085681542","Kent State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277701200","3","Ye Zhao","37277701200","Stony Brook University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898991","4","Boyu Wang","37085898991","Stony Brook University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945011500","5","Minh Hoai","37945011500","Brookhaven National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085902083","6","Kevin Yager","37085902083","Brookhaven National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085905011","7","Wei Xu","37085905011","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030384","1321","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9240062/","","","","","","","","","","","X-ray scattering","Deep learning","Visualization","Tools","Computational modeling","X-ray imaging","Aerospace electronics","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9240062","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","54","1312","Interactive Visual Study of Multiple Attributes Learning Model of X-Ray Scattering Images","27"
"We present an efficient algorithm for visualizing the effect of black holes on its distant surroundings as seen from an observer nearby in orbit. Our solution is GPU-based and builds upon a two-step approach, where we first derive an adaptive grid to map the 360-view around the observer to the distorted celestial sky, which can be directly reused for different camera orientations. Using a grid, we can rapidly trace rays back to the observer through the distorted spacetime, avoiding the heavy workload of standard tracing solutions at real-time rates. By using a novel interpolation technique we can also simulate an observer path by smoothly transitioning between multiple grids. Our approach accepts real star catalogues and environment maps of the celestial sky and generates the resulting black-hole deformations in real time.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9226126/","LOCKED","9226126","Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656272","1","Annemieke Verbraeck","37088656272","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829332900","2","Elmar Eisemann","37829332900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030452","805","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9226126/","Physical & Environmental Sciences","Engineering","Mathematics","Computer Graphics Techniques","Algorithms","","","","","","Observers","Visualization","Distortion","Cameras","Real-time systems","Rendering (computer graphics)","Ray tracing","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9226126","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","55","796","Interactive Black-Hole Visualization","27"
"In the last two decades, interactive visualization and analysis have become a central tool in data-driven decision making. Concurrently to the contributions in data visualization, research in data management has produced technology that directly benefits interactive analysis. Here, we contribute a systematic review of 30 years of work in this adjacent field, and highlight techniques and principles we believe to be underappreciated in visualization work. We structure our review along two axes. First, we use task taxonomies from the visualization literature to structure the space of interactions in usual systems. Second, we created a categorization of data management work that strikes a balance between specificity and generality. Concretely, we contribute a characterization of 131 research papers along these two axes. We find that five notions in data management venues fit interactive visualization systems well: materialized views, approximate query processing, user modeling and query prediction, muiti-query optimization, lineage techniques, and indexing techniques. In addition, we find a preponderance of work in materialized views and approximate query processing, most targeting a limited subset of the interaction tasks in the taxonomy we used. This suggests natural avenues of future research both in visualization and data management. Our categorization both changes how we visualization researchers design and build our systems, and highlights where future work is necessary.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9217931/","LOCKED","9217931","Department of Computer ScienceUniversity of Maryland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086366223","1","Leilani Battle","37086366223","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Computer ScienceUniversity of Arizona","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550809300","2","Carlos Scheidegger","37550809300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028891","1138","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9217931/","","","","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Optimization","Encoding","Visual databases","Visualization","Task analysis","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9217931","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","56","1128","A Structured Review of Data Management Technology for Interactive Visualization and Analysis","27"
"Visualizing spatial data on small-screen devices such as smartphones and smartwatches poses new challenges in computational cartography. The current interfaces for map exploration require their users to zoom in and out frequently. Indeed, zooming and panning are tools suitable for choosing the map extent corresponding to an area of interest. They are not as suitable, however, for resolving the graphical clutter caused by a high feature density since zooming in to a large map scale leads to a loss of context. Therefore, in this paper, we present new external labeling methods that allow a user to navigate through dense sets of points of interest while keeping the current map extent fixed. We provide a unified model, in which labels are placed at the boundary of the map and visually associated with the corresponding features via connecting lines, which are called leaders. Since the screen space is limited, labeling all features at the same time is impractical. Therefore, at any time, we label a subset of the features. We offer interaction techniques to change the current selection of features systematically and, thus, give the user access to all features. We distinguish three methods, which allow the user either to slide the labels along the bottom side of the map or to browse the labels based on pages or stacks. We present a generic algorithmic framework that provides us with the possibility of expressing the different variants of interaction techniques as optimization problems in a unified way. We propose both exact algorithms and fast and simple heuristics that solve the optimization problems taking into account different criteria such as the ranking of the labels, the total leader length as well as the distance between leaders. In experiments on real-world data we evaluate these algorithms and discuss the three variants with respect to their strengths and weaknesses proving the flexibility of the presented algorithmic framework.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222088/","LOCKED","9222088","Geoinformation GroupInstitute of Geodesy and Geoinformation, University of Bonn","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656669","1","Sven Gedicke","37088656669","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoinformation GroupInstitute of Geodesy and Geoinformation, University of Bonn","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655667","2","Annika Bonerath","37088655667","Geoinformation GroupInstitute of Geodesy and Geoinformation, University of Bonn","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086195380","3","Benjamin Niedermann","37086195380","Geoinformation GroupInstitute of Geodesy and Geoinformation, University of Bonn","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017278900","4","Jan-Henrik Haunert","38017278900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030399","1256","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222088/","external labeling","interactive maps","map exploration","small screens","algorithms","optimization","","","","","Labeling","Optimization","Stacking","Navigation","Task analysis","Smart phones","Tools","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222088","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","57","1247","Zoomless Maps: External Labeling Methods for the Interactive Exploration of Dense Point Sets at a Fixed Map Scale","27"
"As an important method of handling potential uncertainties in numerical simulations, ensemble simulation has been widely applied in many disciplines. Visualization is a promising and powerful ensemble simulation analysis method. However, conventional visualization methods mainly aim at data simplification and highlighting important information based on domain expertise instead of providing a flexible data exploration and intervention mechanism. Trial-and-error procedures have to be repeatedly conducted by such approaches. To resolve this issue, we propose a new perspective of ensemble data analysis using the attribute variable dimension as the primary analysis dimension. Particularly, we propose a variable uncertainty calculation method based on variable spatial spreading. Based on this method, we design an interactive ensemble analysis framework that provides a flexible interactive exploration of the ensemble data. Particularly, the proposed spreading curve view, the region stability heat map view, and the temporal analysis view, together with the commonly used 2D map view, jointly support uncertainty distribution perception, region selection, and temporal analysis, as well as other analysis requirements. We verify our approach by analyzing a real-world ensemble simulation dataset. Feedback collected from domain experts confirms the efficacy of our framework.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222092/","LOCKED","9222092","School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656861","1","Mingdong Zhang","37088656861","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280383900","2","Li Chen","37280383900","WeBank, AI Group, Guangdong, Shenzhen, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38542593700","3","Quan Li","38542593700","Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analysis and Application, Peking University, Beijing, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656132","4","Xiaoru Yuan","37088656132","School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37530963900","5","Junhai Yong","37530963900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030377","1818","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222092/","Uncertainty visualization","ensemble visualization","spatial spreading","temporal analysis","","","","","","","Data visualization","Uncertainty","Analytical models","Computational modeling","Visualization","Data models","Stability analysis","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222092","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","58","1808","Uncertainty-Oriented Ensemble Data Visualization and Exploration using Variable Spatial Spreading","27"
"Multidimensional Projection is a fundamental tool for high-dimensional data analytics and visualization. With very few exceptions, projection techniques are designed to map data from a high-dimensional space to a visual space so as to preserve some dissimilarity (similarity) measure, such as the Euclidean distance for example. In fact, although adopting distinct mathematical formulations designed to favor different aspects of the data, most multidimensional projection methods strive to preserve dissimilarity measures that encapsulate geometric properties such as distances or the proximity relation between data objects. However, geometric relations are not the only interesting property to be preserved in a projection. For instance, the analysis of particular structures such as clusters and outliers could be more reliably performed if the mapping process gives some guarantee as to topological invariants such as connected components and loops. This paper introduces TopoMap, a novel projection technique which provides topological guarantees during the mapping process. In particular, the proposed method performs the mapping from a high-dimensional space to a visual space, while preserving the 0-dimensional persistence diagram of the Rips filtration of the high-dimensional data, ensuring that the filtrations generate the same connected components when applied to the original as well as projected data. The presented case studies show that the topological guarantee provided by TopoMap not only brings confidence to the visual analytic process but also can be used to assist in the assessment of other projection methods.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222271/","LOCKED","9222271","New York University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38228713200","1","Harish Doraiswamy","38228713200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CNRS and Sorbonne Université","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37298870300","2","Julien Tierny","37298870300","University of Campinas","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655615","3","Paulo J.

"To mitigate the pain of manually tuning hyperparameters of deep neural networks, automated machine learning (AutoML) methods have been developed to search for an optimal set of hyperparameters in large combinatorial search spaces. However, the search results of AutoML methods significantly depend on initial configurations, making it a non-trivial task to find a proper configuration. Therefore, human intervention via a visual analytic approach bears huge potential in this task. In response, we propose HyperTendril, a web-based visual analytics system that supports user-driven hyperparameter tuning processes in a model-agnostic environment. HyperTendril takes a novel approach to effectively steering hyperparameter optimization through an iterative, interactive tuning procedure that allows users to refine the search spaces and the configuration of the AutoML method based on their own insights from given results. Using HyperTendril, users can obtain insights into the complex behaviors of various hyperparameter search algorithms and diagnose their configurations. In addition, HyperTendril supports variable importance analysis to help the users refine their search spaces based on the analysis of relative importance of different hyperparameters and their interaction effects.

However, developing visualization NLIs remains a challenging task, requiring low-level implementation of natural language processing (NLP) techniques as well as knowledge of visual analytic tasks and visualization design. We present NL4DV, a toolkit for natural language-driven data visualization. NL4DV is a Python package that takes as input a tabular dataset and a natural language query about that dataset. In response, the toolkit returns an analytic specification modeled as a JSON object containing data attributes, analytic tasks, and a list of Vega-Lite specifications relevant to the input query. In doing so, NL4DV aids visualization developers who may not have a background in NLP, enabling them to create new visualization NLIs or incorporate natural language input within their existing systems. We demonstrate NL4DV's usage and capabilities through four examples: 1) rendering visualizations using natural language in a Jupyter notebook, 2) developing a NLI to specify and edit Vega-Lite charts, 3) recreating data ambiguity widgets from the DataTone system, and 4) incorporating speech input to create a multimodal visualization system.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222342/","LOCKED","9222342","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087083944","1","Arpit Narechania","37087083944","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086239144","2","Arjun Srinivasan","37086239144","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267736900","3","John Stasko","37267736900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030378","379","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222342/","Natural Language Interfaces","Visualization Toolkits","","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Task analysis","Natural language processing","Grammar","Motion pictures","","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222342","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","61","369","NL4DV: A Toolkit for Generating Analytic Specifications for Data Visualization from Natural Language Queries","27"
"Infographic is a data visualization technique which combines graphic and textual descriptions in an aesthetic and effective manner. Creating infographics is a difficult and time-consuming process which often requires significant attempts and adjustments even for experienced designers, not to mention novice users with limited design expertise. Recently, a few approaches have been proposed to automate the creation process by applying predefined blueprints to user information. However, predefined blueprints are often hard to create, hence limited in volume and diversity. In contrast, good infogrpahics have been created by professionals and accumulated on the Internet rapidly. These online examples often represent a wide variety of design styles, and serve as exemplars or inspiration to people who like to create their own infographics. Based on these observations, we propose to generate infographics by automatically imitating examples. We present a two-stage approach, namely retrieve-then-adapt. In the retrieval stage, we index online examples by their visual elements. For a given user information, we transform it to a concrete query by sampling from a learned distribution about visual elements, and then find appropriate examples in our example library based on the similarity between example indexes and the query. For a retrieved example, we generate an initial drafts by replacing its content with user information. However, in many cases, user information cannot be perfectly fitted to retrieved examples. Therefore, we further introduce an adaption stage. Specifically, we propose a MCMC-like approach and leverage recursive neural networks to help adjust the initial draft and improve its visual appearance iteratively, until a satisfactory result is obtained. We implement our approach on widely-used proportion-related infographics, and demonstrate its effectiveness by sample results and expert reviews.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9233469/","LOCKED","9233469","Microsoft Research AsiaPeking University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655324","1","Chunyao Qian","37088655324","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Microsoft Research Asia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656739","2","Shizhao Sun","37088656739","Microsoft Research Asia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391623900","3","Weiwei Cui","37391623900","Microsoft Research Asia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656439","4","Jian-Guang Lou","37088656439","Microsoft Research Asia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073639100","5","Haidong Zhang","37073639100","Microsoft Research Asia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102566","6","Dongmei Zhang","37087102566","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030448","452","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9233469/","Infographics","automatic visualization","","","","","","","","","Visualization","Layout","Libraries","Tools","Internet","Indexes","Neural networks","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9233469","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","62","443","Retrieve-Then-Adapt: Example-based Automatic Generation for Proportion-related Infographics","27"
"We present an atmospheric model tailored for the interactive visualization of planetary surfaces. As the exploration of the solar system is progressing with increasingly accurate missions and instruments, the faithful visualization of planetary environments is gaining increasing interest in space research, mission planning, and science communication and education. Atmospheric effects are crucial in data analysis and to provide contextual information for planetary data. Our model correctly accounts for the non-linear path of the light inside the atmosphere (in Earth's case), the light absorption effects by molecules and dust particles, such as the ozone layer and the Martian dust, and a wavelength-dependent phase function for Mie scattering. The mode focuses on interactivity, versatility, and customization, and a comprehensive set of interactive controls make it possible to adapt its appearance dynamically. We demonstrate our results using Earth and Mars as examples. However, it can be readily adapted for the exploration of other atmospheres found on, for example, of exoplanets. For Earth's atmosphere, we visually compare our results with pictures taken from the International Space Station and against the CIE clear sky model. The Martian atmosphere is reproduced based on available scientific data, feedback from domain experts, and is compared to images taken by the Curiosity rover. The work presented here has been implemented in the OpenSpace system, which enables interactive parameter setting and real-time feedback visualization targeting presentations in a wide range of environments, from immersive dome theaters to virtual reality headsets.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222377/","LOCKED","9222377","New York University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102777","1","Jonathas Costa","37087102777","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Linköping University, University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489536800","2","Alexander Bock","38489536800","American Museum of Natural History","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085747250","3","Carter Emmart","37085747250","University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266777200","4","Charles Hansen","37266777200","Linköping University, University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284192000","5","Anders Ynnerman","37284192000","New York University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086888182","6","Cláudio Silva","37086888182","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030333","795","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222377/","Physical & Environmental Sciences","Engineering","Mathematics","Computer Graphics Techniques","","","","","","","Atmospheric modeling","Data visualization","Terrestrial atmosphere","Scattering","Atmospheric measurements","Real-time systems","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222377","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","63","785","Interactive Visualization of Atmospheric Effects for Celestial Bodies","27"
"In various domains, there are abundant streams or sequences of multi-item data of various kinds, e.g. streams of news and social media texts, sequences of genes and sports events, etc. Comparison is an important and general task in data analysis. For comparing data streams involving multiple items (e.g., words in texts, actors or action types in action sequences, visited places in itineraries, etc.), we propose Co-Bridges, a visual design involving connection and comparison techniques that reveal similarities and differences between two streams. Co-Bridges use river and bridge metaphors, where two sides of a river represent data streams, and bridges connect temporally or sequentially aligned segments of streams. Commonalities and differences between these segments in terms of involvement of various items are shown on the bridges. Interactive query tools support the selection of particular stream subsets for focused exploration. The visualization supports both qualitative (common and distinct items) and quantitative (stream volume, amount of item involvement) comparisons. We further propose Comparison-of-Comparisons, in which two or more Co-Bridges corresponding to different selections are juxtaposed. We test the applicability of the Co-Bridges in different domains, including social media text streams and sports event sequences. We perform an evaluation of the users' capability to understand and use Co-Bridges. The results confirm that Co-Bridges is effective for supporting pair-wise visual comparisons in a wide range of applications.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9246250/","LOCKED","9246250","Fudan University, School of data science, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387892","1","Siming Chen","37085387892","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047700","2","Natalia Andrienko","37283047700","Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047100","3","Gennady Andrienko","37283047100","Tianjin University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085431300","4","Jie Li","37085431300","Peking University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403856700","5","Xiaoru Yuan","37403856700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030411","1622","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9246250/","Visual Comparison","Pair-wise Analysis","Multi-item Data Stream","Social Media","","","","","","","Rivers","Social networking (online)","Data visualization","Task analysis","Bridges","Visual analytics","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9246250","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","64","1612","Co-Bridges: Pair-wise Visual Connection and Comparison for Multi-item Data Streams","27"
"We present a comprehensive framework for evaluating line chart smoothing methods under a variety of visual analytics tasks. Line charts are commonly used to visualize a series of data samples. When the number of samples is large, or the data are noisy, smoothing can be applied to make the signal more apparent. However, there are a wide variety of smoothing techniques available, and the effectiveness of each depends upon both nature of the data and the visual analytics task at hand. To date, the visualization community lacks a summary work for analyzing and classifying the various smoothing methods available. In this paper, we establish a framework, based on 8 measures of the line smoothing effectiveness tied to 8 low-level visual analytics tasks. We then analyze 12 methods coming from 4 commonly used classes of line chart smoothing-rank filters, convolutional filters, frequency domain filters, and subsampling. The results show that while no method is ideal for all situations, certain methods, such as Gaussian filters and TOPOLOGY-based subsampling, perform well in general. Other methods, such as low-pass CUTOFF filters and Douglas-peucker subsampling, perform well for specific visual analytics tasks. Almost as importantly, our framework demonstrates that several methods, including the commonly used UNIFORM subsampling, produce low-quality results, and should, therefore, be avoided, if possible.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222269/","LOCKED","9222269","University of South Florida","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398611400","1","Paul Rosen","37398611400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of South Florida","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086556695","2","Ghulam Jilani Quadri","37086556695","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030421","1546","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222269/","Line chart","data smoothing","time-series","","","","","","","","Smoothing methods","Task analysis","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Market research","Frequency-domain analysis","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222269","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","65","1536","LineSmooth: An Analytical Framework for Evaluating the Effectiveness of Smoothing Techniques on Line Charts","27"
"In this paper we present a user-friendly sketching-based suggestive interface for untangling mathematical knots with complicated structures. Rather than treating mathematical knots as if they were 3D ropes, our interface is designed to assist the user to interact with knots with the right sequence of mathematically legal moves. Our knot interface allows one to sketch and untangle knots by proposing the Reidemeister moves, and can guide the user to untangle mathematical knots to the fewest possible number of crossings by suggesting the moves needed. The system highlights parts of the knot where the Reidemeister moves are applicable, suggests the possible moves, and constrains the user's drawing to legal moves only. This ongoing suggestion is based on a Reidemeister move analyzer, that reads the evolving knot in its Gauss code and predicts the needed Reidemeister moves towards the fewest possible number of crossings. For our principal test case of mathematical knot diagrams, this for the first time permits us to visualize, analyze, and deform them in a mathematical visual interface. In addition, understanding of a fairly long mathematical deformation sequence in our interface can be aided by visual analysis and comparison over the identified “key moments” where only critical changes occur in the sequence. Our knot interface allows users to track and trace mathematical knot deformation with a significantly reduced number of visual frames containing only the Reidemeister moves being applied. All these combine to allow a much cleaner exploratory interface for us to analyze and study mathematical knots and their dynamics in topological space.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216595/","LOCKED","9216595","University of Louisville","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655706","1","Huan Liu","37088655706","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Louisville","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544896","2","Hui Zhang","37086544896","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028893","602","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216595/","Knot theory","Reidemeister moves","Gauss code","Mathematical visualization","Suggestive interface","","","","","","Three-dimensional displays","Visualization","Image reconstruction","Strain","Geometry","Law","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9216595","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","66","593","A Suggestive Interface for Untangling Mathematical Knots","27"
"Animated transitions help viewers follow changes between related visualizations. Specifying effective animations demands significant effort: authors must select the elements and properties to animate, provide transition parameters, and coordinate the timing of stages. To facilitate this process, we present Gemini, a declarative grammar and recommendation system for animated transitions between single-view statistical graphics. Gemini specifications define transition “steps” in terms of high-level visual components (marks, axes, legends) and composition rules to synchronize and concatenate steps. With this grammar, Gemini can recommend animation designs to augment and accelerate designers' work. Gemini enumerates staged animation designs for given start and end states, and ranks those designs using a cost function informed by prior perceptual studies. To evaluate Gemini, we conduct both a formative study on Mechanical Turk to assess and tune our ranking function, and a summative study in which 8 experienced visualization developers implement animations in D3 that we then compare to Gemini's suggestions. We find that most designs (9/11) are exactly replicable in Gemini, with many (8/11) achievable via edits to suggestions, and that Gemini suggestions avoid multiple participant errors.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9234027/","LOCKED","9234027","University of Washington","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655997","1","Younghoon Kim","37088655997","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Washington","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550791300","2","Jeffrey Heer","37550791300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030360","494","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9234027/","Animated transition","animation","transition","declarative grammar","automated design","charts","","","","","Animation","Data visualization","Grammar","Visualization","Timing","Task analysis","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9234027","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","67","485","Gemini: A Grammar and Recommender System for Animated Transitions in Statistical Graphics","27"
"Computationally demanding tasks are typically calculated in dedicated data centers, and real-time visualizations also follow this trend. Some rendering tasks, however, require the highest level of confidentiality so that no other party, besides the owner, can read or see the sensitive data. Here we present a direct volume rendering approach that performs volume rendering directly on encrypted volume data by using the homomorphic Paillier encryption algorithm. This approach ensures that the volume data and rendered image are uninterpretable to the rendering server. Our volume rendering pipeline introduces novel approaches for encrypted-data compositing, interpolation, and opacity modulation, as well as simple transfer function design, where each of these routines maintains the highest level of privacy. We present performance and memory overhead analysis that is associated with our privacy-preserving scheme. Our approach is open and secure by design, as opposed to secure through obscurity. Owners of the data only have to keep their secure key confidential to guarantee the privacy of their volume data and the rendered images. Our work is, to our knowledge, the first privacy-preserving remote volume-rendering approach that does not require that any server involved be trustworthy; even in cases when the server is compromised, no sensitive data will be leaked to a foreign party.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222562/","CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

"Efficient layout of large-scale graphs remains a challenging problem: the force-directed and dimensionality reduction-based methods suffer from high overhead for graph distance and gradient computation. In this paper, we present a new graph layout algorithm, called DRGraph, that enhances the nonlinear dimensionality reduction process with three schemes: approximating graph distances by means of a sparse distance matrix, estimating the gradient by using the negative sampling technique, and accelerating the optimization process through a multi-level layout scheme. DRGraph achieves a linear complexity for the computation and memory consumption, and scales up to large-scale graphs with millions of nodes. Experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art graph layout methods demonstrate that DRGraph can generate visually comparable layouts with a faster running time and a lower memory requirement.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9282195/","LOCKED","9282195","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656863","1","Minfeng Zhu","37088656863","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085418543","2","Wei Chen","37085418543","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100719","3","Yuanzhe Hu","37087100719","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655641","4","Yuxuan Hou","37088655641","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087027721","5","Liangjun Liu","37087027721","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655518","6","Kaiyuan Zhang","37088655518","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030447","1676","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9282195/","graph visualization","graph layout","dimensionality reduction","force-directed layout","","","","","","","Layout","Dimensionality reduction","Computational complexity","Optimization","Acceleration","Memory management","Principal component analysis","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9282195","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","69","1666","DRGraph: An Efficient Graph Layout Algorithm for Large-scale Graphs by Dimensionality Reduction","27"
"Immersive technologies offer new opportunities to support collaborative visual data analysis by providing each collaborator a personal, high-resolution view of a flexible shared visualisation space through a head mounted display. However, most prior studies of collaborative immersive analytics have focused on how groups interact with surface interfaces such as tabletops and wall displays. This paper reports on a study in which teams of three co-located participants are given flexible visualisation authoring tools to allow a great deal of control in how they structure their shared workspace. They do so using a prototype system we call FIESTA: the Free-roaming Immersive Environment to Support Team-based Analysis. Unlike traditional visualisation tools, FIESTA allows users to freely position authoring interfaces and visualisation artefacts anywhere in the virtual environment, either on virtual surfaces or suspended within the interaction space. Our participants solved visual analytics tasks on a multivariate data set, doing so individually and collaboratively by creating a large number of 2D and 3D visualisations. Their behaviours suggest that the usage of surfaces is coupled with the type of visualisation used, often using walls to organise 2D visualisations, but positioning 3D visualisations in the space around them. Outside of tightly-coupled collaboration, participants followed social protocols and did not interact with visualisations that did not belong to them even if outside of its owner's personal workspace.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222346/","LOCKED","9222346","Monash University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656926","1","Benjamin Lee","37088656926","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Monash University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655968","2","Xiaoyun Hu","37088655968","Monash University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085649401","3","Maxime Cordeil","37085649401","Monash University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086068796","4","Arnaud Prouzeau","37086068796","Monash University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38488917300","5","Bernhard Jenny","38488917300","Monash University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326161000","6","Tim Dwyer","37326161000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030450","1181","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222346/","Immersive analytics","collaboration","virtual reality","qualitative study","multivariate data","","","","","","Data visualization","Collaboration","Three-dimensional displays","Task analysis","Two dimensional displays","Microsoft Windows","Virtual environments","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222346","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","70","1171","Shared Surfaces and Spaces: Collaborative Data Visualisation in a Co-located Immersive Environment","27"
"Spatially-resolved omics-data enable researchers to precisely distinguish cell types in tissue and explore their spatial interactions, enabling deep understanding of tissue functionality. To understand what causes or deteriorates a disease and identify related biomarkers, clinical researchers regularly perform large-scale cohort studies, requiring the comparison of such data at cellular level. In such studies, with little a-priori knowledge of what to expect in the data, explorative data analysis is a necessity. Here, we present an interactive visual analysis workflow for the comparison of cohorts of spatially-resolved omics-data. Our workflow allows the comparative analysis of two cohorts based on multiple levels-of-detail, from simple abundance of contained cell types over complex co-localization patterns to individual comparison of complete tissue images. As a result, the workflow enables the identification of cohort-differentiating features, as well as outlier samples at any stage of the workflow. During the development of the workflow, we continuously consulted with domain experts.

"Using causal relations to guide decision making has become an essential analytical task across various domains, from marketing and medicine to education and social science. While powerful statistical models have been developed for inferring causal relations from data, domain practitioners still lack effective visual interface for interpreting the causal relations and applying them in their decision-making process. Through interview studies with domain experts, we characterize their current decision-making workflows, challenges, and needs. Through an iterative design process, we developed a visualization tool that allows analysts to explore, validate, and apply causal relations in real-world decision-making scenarios. The tool provides an uncertainty-aware causal graph visualization for presenting a large set of causal relations inferred from high-dimensional data. On top of the causal graph, it supports a set of intuitive user controls for performing what-if analyses and making action plans. We report on two case studies in marketing and student advising to demonstrate that users can effectively explore causal relations and design action plans for reaching their goals.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216629/","LOCKED","9216629","State Key Lab of CAD&CGZhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086448603","1","Xiao Xie","37086448603","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","State Key Lab of CAD&CGZhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656063","2","Fan Du","37088656063","Adobe Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","3","Yingcai Wu","37407308300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028957","1458","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216629/","Exploratory causal analysis","correlation and causation","causal graph","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Uncertainty","Decision making","Analytical models","Predictive models","Machine learning","Visual analytics","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9216629","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","72","1448","A Visual Analytics Approach for Exploratory Causal Analysis: Exploration, Validation, and Applications","27"
"Researchers in the field of connectomics are working to reconstruct a map of neural connections in the brain in order to understand at a fundamental level how the brain processes information. Constructing this wiring diagram is done by tracing neurons through high-resolution image stacks acquired with fluorescence microscopy imaging techniques. While a large number of automatic tracing algorithms have been proposed, these frequently rely on local features in the data and fail on noisy data or ambiguous cases, requiring time-consuming manual correction. As a result, manual and semi-automatic tracing methods remain the state-of-the-art for creating accurate neuron reconstructions. We propose a new semi-automatic method that uses topological features to guide users in tracing neurons and integrate this method within a virtual reality (VR) framework previously used for manual tracing. Our approach augments both visualization and interaction with topological elements, allowing rapid understanding and tracing of complex morphologies. In our pilot study, neuroscientists demonstrated a strong preference for using our tool over prior approaches, reported less fatigue during tracing, and commended the ability to better understand possible paths and alternatives. Quantitative evaluation of the traces reveals that users' tracing speed increased, while retaining similar accuracy compared to a fully manual approach.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9226101/","LOCKED","9226101","SCI Institute, University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655661","1","Torin McDonald","37088655661","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SCI Institute, University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085735276","2","Will Usher","37085735276","SCI Institute, University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087129005","3","Nate Morrical","37087129005","SCI Institute, University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870001700","4","Attila Gyulassy","37870001700","SCI Institute, University of Utah, Utah State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086120775","5","Steve Petruzza","37086120775","Moran Eye Institute, University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085895011","6","Frederick Federer","37085895011","Moran Eye Institute, University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085886744","7","Alessandra Angelucci","37085886744","SCI Institute, University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284312600","8","Valerio Pascucci","37284312600","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030363","754","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9226101/","Virtual Reality","Morse-Smale Complex","Semi-automatic Neuron Tracing","","","","","","","","Neurons","Tools","Manuals","Image reconstruction","Three-dimensional displays","Data visualization","Virtual reality","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9226101","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","73","744","Improving the Usability of Virtual Reality Neuron Tracing with Topological Elements","27"
"In practice, charts are widely stored as bitmap images. Although easily consumed by humans, they are not convenient for other uses. For example, changing the chart style or type or a data value in a chart image practically requires creating a completely new chart, which is often a time-consuming and error-prone process. To assist these tasks, many approaches have been proposed to automatically extract information from chart images with computer vision and machine learning techniques. Although they have achieved promising preliminary results, there are still a lot of challenges to overcome in terms of robustness and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel alternative approach called Chartem to address this issue directly from the root. Specifically, we design a data-embedding schema to encode a significant amount of information into the background of a chart image without interfering human perception of the chart. The embedded information, when extracted from the image, can enable a variety of visualization applications to reuse or repurpose chart images. To evaluate the effectiveness of Chartem, we conduct a user study and performance experiments on Chartem embedding and extraction algorithms. We further present several prototype applications to demonstrate the utility of Chartem.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9293003/","LOCKED","9293003","Natl. Eng. Res.

"GIFs are enjoying increasing popularity on social media as a format for data-driven storytelling with visualization; simple visual messages are embedded in short animations that usually last less than 15 seconds and are played in automatic repetition. In this paper, we ask the question, “What makes a data-GIF understandable?” While other storytelling formats such as data videos, infographics, or data comics are relatively well studied, we have little knowledge about the design factors and principles for “data-GIFs”. To close this gap, we provide results from semi-structured interviews and an online study with a total of 118 participants investigating the impact of design decisions on the understandability of data-GIFs. The study and our consequent analysis are informed by a systematic review and structured design space of 108 data-GIFs that we found online. Our results show the impact of design dimensions from our design space such as animation encoding, context preservation, or repetition on viewers understanding of the GIF's core message. The paper concludes with a list of suggestions for creating more effective Data-GIFs.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222309/","LOCKED","9222309","State Key Lab of CAD&CGZhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086245904","1","Xinhuan Shu","37086245904","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086808853","2","Aoyu Wu","37086808853","State Key Lab of CAD&CGZhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655779","3","Junxiu Tang","37088655779","Edinburgh University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085687578","4","Benjamin Bach","37085687578","State Key Lab of CAD&CGZhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","5","Yingcai Wu","37407308300","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","6","Huamin Qu","37272637300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030396","1502","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222309/","Data-GIFs","Data-driven Storytelling","Evaluation","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Animation","Videos","Visualization","Social networking (online)","Interviews","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222309","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","75","1492","What Makes a Data-GIF Understandable?","27"
"We design and evaluate a novel layout fine-tuning technique for node-link diagrams that facilitates exemplar-based adjustment of a group of substructures in batching mode. The key idea is to transfer user modifications on a local substructure to other substructures in the entire graph that are topologically similar to the exemplar. We first precompute a canonical representation for each substructure with node embedding techniques and then use it for on-the-fly substructure retrieval. We design and develop a light-weight interactive system to enable intuitive adjustment, modification transfer, and visual graph exploration. We also report some results of quantitative comparisons, three case studies, and a within-participant user study.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9240072/","LOCKED","9240072","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655328","1","Jiacheng Pan","37088655328","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37066106100","2","Wei Chen","37066106100","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656384","3","Xiaodong Zhao","37088656384","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102451","4","Shuyue Zhou","37087102451","Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101788","5","Wei Zeng","37087101788","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086420980","6","Minfeng Zhu","37086420980","Ohio State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656837","7","Jian Chen","37088656837","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656753","8","Siwei Fu","37088656753","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085393659","9","Yingcai Wu","37085393659","","","","","","1","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030393","1665","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9240072/","Node-link diagram","graph layout","graph visualization","user interactions","","","","","","","Layout","Optimization","Merging","Topology","Two dimensional displays","Software algorithms","Measurement","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9240072","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","76","1655","Exemplar-based Layout Fine-tuning for Node-link Diagrams","27"
"We present ShuttleSpace, an immersive analytics system to assist experts in analyzing trajectory data in badminton. Trajectories in sports, such as the movement of players and balls, contain rich information on player behavior and thus have been widely analyzed by coaches and analysts to improve the players' performance. However, existing visual analytics systems often present the trajectories in court diagrams that are abstractions of reality, thereby causing difficulty for the experts to imagine the situation on the court and understand why the player acted in a certain way. With recent developments in immersive technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), experts gradually have the opportunity to see, feel, explore, and understand these 3D trajectories from the player's perspective. Yet, few research has studied how to support immersive analysis of sports data from such a perspective. Specific challenges are rooted in data presentation (e.g., how to seamlessly combine 2D and 3D visualizations) and interaction (e.g., how to naturally interact with data without keyboard and mouse) in VR. To address these challenges, we have worked closely with domain experts who have worked for a top national badminton team to design ShuttleSpace. Our system leverages 1) the peripheral vision to combine the 2D and 3D visualizations and 2) the VR controller to support natural interactions via a stroke metaphor. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ShuttleSpace through three case studies conducted by the experts with useful insights. We further conduct interviews with the experts whose feedback confirms that our first-person immersive analytics system is suitable and useful for analyzing badminton data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222313/","LOCKED","9222313","State Key Lab of CAD CGZhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656280","1","Shuainan Ye","37088656280","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085793208","2","Zhutian Chen","37085793208","State Key Lab of CAD CGZhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655788","3","Xiangtong Chu","37088655788","State Key Lab of CAD CGZhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656953","4","Yifan Wang","37088656953","Zhejiang Lab","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656753","5","Siwei Fu","37088656753","Chengdu Sports University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655895","6","Lejun Shen","37088655895","State Key Lab of CAD CGZhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085658969","7","Kun Zhou","37085658969","State Key Lab of CAD CGZhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","8","Yingcai Wu","37407308300","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030392","869","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222313/","Movement trajectory","badminton analytics","virtual reality","","","","","","","","Trajectory","Three-dimensional displays","Sports","Data visualization","Two dimensional displays","Visualization","Games","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222313","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","77","860","ShuttleSpace: Exploring and Analyzing Movement Trajectory in Immersive Visualization","27"
"Abstract data has no natural scale and so interactive data visualizations must provide techniques to allow the user to choose their viewpoint and scale. Such techniques are well established in desktop visualization tools. The two most common techniques are zoom+pan and overview+detail. However, how best to enable the analyst to navigate and view abstract data at different levels of scale in immersive environments has not previously been studied. We report the findings of the first systematic study of immersive navigation techniques for 3D scatterplots. We tested four conditions that represent our best attempt to adapt standard 2D navigation techniques to data visualization in an immersive environment while still providing standard immersive navigation techniques through physical movement and teleportation. We compared room-sized visualization versus a zooming interface, each with and without an overview. We find significant differences in participants' response times and accuracy for a number of standard visual analysis tasks. Both zoom and overview provide benefits over standard locomotion support alone (i.e., physical movement and pointer teleportation). However, which variation is superior, depends on the task. We obtain a more nuanced understanding of the results by analyzing them in terms of a time-cost model for the different components of navigation: way-finding, travel, number of travel steps, and context switching.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222098/","LOCKED","9222098","Harvard University, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Cambridge, MA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085820538","1","Yalong Yang","37085820538","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Human-Centred Computing, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085649401","2","Maxime Cordeil","37085649401","Harvard University, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Cambridge, MA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37409575800","3","Johanna Beyer","37409575800","Department of Human-Centred Computing, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326161000","4","Tim Dwyer","37326161000","Department of Human-Centred Computing, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37354163600","5","Kim Marriott","37354163600","Harvard University, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Cambridge, MA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","6","Hanspeter Pfister","37275698100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030427","1224","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222098/","Immersive Analytics","Information Visualization","Virtual Reality","Navigation","Overview+Detail","Zooming","Scatterplot","","","","Navigation","Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Legged locomotion","Task analysis","Standards","Two dimensional displays","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222098","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","78","1214","Embodied Navigation in Immersive Abstract Data Visualization: Is Overview+Detail or Zooming Better for 3D Scatterplots?","27"
"Differential Privacy is an emerging privacy model with increasing popularity in many domains. It functions by adding carefully calibrated noise to data that blurs information about individuals while preserving overall statistics about the population. Theoretically, it is possible to produce robust privacy-preserving visualizations by plotting differentially private data. However, noise-induced data perturbations can alter visual patterns and impact the utility of a private visualization. We still know little about the challenges and opportunities for visual data exploration and analysis using private visualizations. As a first step towards filling this gap, we conducted a crowdsourced experiment, measuring participants' performance under three levels of privacy (high, low, non-private) for combinations of eight analysis tasks and four visualization types (bar chart, pie chart, line chart, scatter plot). Our findings show that for participants' accuracy for summary tasks (e.g., find clusters in data) was higher that value tasks (e.g., retrieve a certain value). We also found that under DP, pie chart and line chart offer similar or better accuracy than bar chart. In this work, we contribute the results of our empirical study, investigating the task-based effectiveness of basic private visualizations, a dichotomous model for defining and measuring user success in performing visual analysis tasks under DP, and a set of distribution metrics for tuning the injection to improve the utility of private visualizations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9228893/","LOCKED","9228893","University of Massachusetts, Amherst","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656002","1","Dan Zhang","37088656002","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Massachusetts, Amherst","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591344300","2","Ali Sarvghad","37591344300","University of Massachusetts, Amherst","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37671502100","3","Gerome Miklau","37671502100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030369","1796","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9228893/","Differential privacy","information visualization","","","","","","","","","Task analysis","Visualization","Data visualization","Histograms","Privacy","Differential privacy","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9228893","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","79","1786","Investigating Visual Analysis of Differentially Private Data","27"
"Data science is a rapidly growing discipline and organizations increasingly depend on data science work. Yet the ambiguity around data science, what it is, and who data scientists are can make it difficult for visualization researchers to identify impactful research trajectories. We have conducted a retrospective analysis of data science work and workers as described within the data visualization, human computer interaction, and data science literature. From this analysis we synthesis a comprehensive model that describes data science work and breakdown to data scientists into nine distinct roles. We summarise and reflect on the role that visualization has throughout data science work and the varied needs of data scientists themselves for tooling support. Our findings are intended to arm visualization researchers with a more concrete framing of data science with the hope that it will help them surface innovative opportunities for impacting data science work.

"Data visualization is powerful in large part because it facilitates visual extraction of values. Yet, existing measures of perceptual precision for data channels (e.g., position, length, orientation, etc.) are based largely on verbal reports of ratio judgments between two values (e.g., [7]). Verbal report conflates multiple sources of error beyond actual visual precision, introducing a ratio computation between these values and a requirement to translate that ratio to a verbal number. Here we observe raw measures of precision by eliminating both ratio computations and verbal reports; we simply ask participants to reproduce marks (a single bar or dot) to match a previously seen one. We manipulated whether the mark was initially presented (and later drawn) alone, paired with a reference (e.g. a second ‘100%’ bar also present at test, or a y-axis for the dot), or integrated with the reference (merging that reference bar into a stacked bar graph, or placing the dot directly on the axis). Reproductions of smaller values were overestimated, and larger values were underestimated, suggesting systematic memory biases. Average reproduction error was around 10% of the actual value, regardless of whether the reproduction was done on a common baseline with the original. In the reference and (especially) the integrated conditions, responses were repulsed from an implicit midpoint of the reference mark, such that values above 50% were overestimated, and values below 50% were underestimated. This reproduction paradigm may serve within a new suite of more fundamental measures of the precision of graphical perception.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9288884/","LOCKED","9288884","Northwestern University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656408","1","Caitlyn M.

"Sampling is a widely used graph reduction technique to accelerate graph computations and simplify graph visualizations. By comprehensively analyzing the literature on graph sampling, we assume that existing algorithms cannot effectively preserve minority structures that are rare and small in a graph but are very important in graph analysis. In this work, we initially conduct a pilot user study to investigate representative minority structures that are most appealing to human viewers. We then perform an experimental study to evaluate the performance of existing graph sampling algorithms regarding minority structure preservation. Results confirm our assumption and suggest key points for designing a new graph sampling approach named mino-centric graph sampling (MCGS). In this approach, a triangle-based algorithm and a cut-point-based algorithm are proposed to efficiently identify minority structures. A set of importance assessment criteria are designed to guide the preservation of important minority structures. Three optimization objectives are introduced into a greedy strategy to balance the preservation between minority and majority structures and suppress the generation of new minority structures. A series of experiments and case studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MCGS.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222065/","LOCKED","9222065","School of Computer Sciences and Engineering, Central South University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085336513","1","Ying Zhao","37085336513","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","School of Computer Sciences and Engineering, Central South University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087503364","2","Haojin Jiang","37087503364","School of Computer Sciences and Engineering, Central South University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655720","3","Qi'an Chen","37088655720","School of Computer Sciences and Engineering, Central South University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087503289","4","Yaqi Qin","37087503289","School of Computer Sciences and Engineering, Central South University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656255","5","Huixuan Xie","37088656255","School of Computer Sciences and Engineering, Central South University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656291","6","Yitao Wu","37088656291","School of Software, Tsinghua University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085444480","7","Shixia Liu","37085444480","School of Computer Sciences and Engineering, Central South University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656551","8","Zhiguang Zhou","37088656551","School of Computer Sciences and Engineering, Central South University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37531405500","9","Jiazhi Xia","37531405500","School of InformationZhejiang University of Finance and Economics China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085399108","10","Fangfang Zhou","37085399108","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030428","1708","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222065/","Graph sampling","graph visualization","node-link diagram","","","","","","","","Measurement","Image edge detection","Acceleration","Visualization","Bridges","Visual perception","Optimization","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222065","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","82","1698","Preserving Minority Structures in Graph Sampling","27"
"Adapting dashboard design to different contexts of use is an open question in visualisation research. Dashboard designers often seek to strike a balance between dashboard adaptability and ease-of-use, and in hospitals challenges arise from the vast diversity of key metrics, data models and users involved at different organizational levels. In this design study, we present QualDash, a dashboard generation engine that allows for the dynamic configuration and deployment of visualisation dashboards for healthcare quality improvement (QI). We present a rigorous task analysis based on interviews with healthcare professionals, a co-design workshop and a series of one-on-one meetings with front line analysts. From these activities we define a metric card metaphor as a unit of visual analysis in healthcare QI, using this concept as a building block for generating highly adaptable dashboards, and leading to the design of a Metric Specification Structure (MSS). Each MSS is a JSON structure which enables dashboard authors to concisely configure unit-specific variants of a metric card, while offloading common patterns that are shared across cards to be preset by the engine. We reflect on deploying and iterating the design of OualDash in cardiology wards and pediatric intensive care units of five NHS hospitals. Finally, we report evaluation results that demonstrate the adaptability, ease-of-use and usefulness of QualDash in a real-world scenario.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222315/","LOCKED","9222315","University of Bradford and the Wolfson Centre for Applied Health Research, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085641969","1","Mai Elshehaly","37085641969","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Bradford and the Wolfson Centre for Applied Health Research, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38096424400","2","Rebecca Randell","38096424400","Tableau, Seattle, Washington, United States","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37719161300","3","Matthew Brehmer","37719161300","University of Bradford and the Wolfson Centre for Applied Health Research, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086616573","4","Lynn McVey","37086616573","University of Bradford and the Wolfson Centre for Applied Health Research, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086618015","5","Natasha Alvarado","37086618015","University of Leeds, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655811","6","Chris P.

"In this paper, we introduce 11–20 (Image Insight 2020), a multimedia analytics approach for analytic categorization of image collections. Advanced visualizations for image collections exist, but they need tight integration with a machine model to support the task of analytic categorization. Directly employing computer vision and interactive learning techniques gravitates towards search. Analytic categorization, however, is not machine classification (the difference between the two is called the pragmatic gap): a human adds/redefines/deletes categories of relevance on the fly to build insight, whereas the machine classifier is rigid and non-adaptive. Analytic categorization that truly brings the user to insight requires a flexible machine model that allows dynamic sliding on the exploration-search axis, as well as semantic interactions: a human thinks about image data mostly in semantic terms. 11–20 brings three major contributions to multimedia analytics on image collections and towards closing the pragmatic gap. Firstly, a new machine model that closely follows the user's interactions and dynamically models her categories of relevance. II-20's machine model, in addition to matching and exceeding the state of the art's ability to produce relevant suggestions, allows the user to dynamically slide on the exploration-search axis without any additional input from her side. Secondly, the dynamic, 1-image-at-a-time Tetris metaphor that synergizes with the model. It allows a well-trained model to analyze the collection by itself with minimal interaction from the user and complements the classic grid metaphor. Thirdly, the fast-forward interaction, allowing the user to harness the model to quickly expand (“fast-forward”) the categories of relevance, expands the multimedia analytics semantic interaction dictionary. Automated experiments show that II-20's machine model outperforms the existing state of the art and also demonstrate the Tetris metaphor's analytic quality. User studies further confirm that II–20 is an intuitive, efficient, and effective multimedia analytics tool.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9230430/","LOCKED","9230430","Czech Technical University, Prague","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085525587","1","Jan Zahálka","37085525587","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Amsterdam","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267865600","2","Marcel Worring","37267865600","Eindhoven University of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267249200","3","Jarke J.

"Text alignment is one of the fundamental techniques text-related domains like natural language processing, computational linguistics, and digital humanities. It compares two or more texts with each other aiming to find similar textual patterns, or to estimate in general how different or similar the texts are. Visualizing alignment results is an essential task, because it helps researchers getting a comprehensive overview of individual findings and the overall pattern structure. Different approaches have been developed to visualize and help making sense of these patterns depending on text size, alignment methods, and, most importantly, the underlying research tasks demanding for alignment. On the basis of those tasks, we reviewed existing text alignment visualization approaches, and discuss their advantages and drawbacks. We finally derive design implications and shed light on related future challenges.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9220137/","LOCKED","9220137","Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655318","1","Tariq Yousef","37088655318","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38243241100","2","Stefan Janicke","38243241100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028975","1159","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9220137/","Text Alignment","Text Visualization","Collation","Text Re-Use","Plagiarism Analysis","Translation Studies","","","","","Task analysis","Data visualization","Visualization","Heuristic algorithms","Tools","Bioinformatics","Dynamic programming","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9220137","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","85","1149","A Survey of Text Alignment Visualization","27"
"A growing number of efforts aim to understand what people see when using a visualization. These efforts provide scientific grounding to complement design intuitions, leading to more effective visualization practice. However, published visualization research currently reflects a limited set of available methods for understanding how people process visualized data. Alternative methods from vision science offer a rich suite of tools for understanding visualizations, but no curated collection of these methods exists in either perception or visualization research. We introduce a design space of experimental methods for empirically investigating the perceptual processes involved with viewing data visualizations to ultimately inform visualization design guidelines. This paper provides a shared lexicon for facilitating experimental visualization research. We discuss popular experimental paradigms, adjustment types, response types, and dependent measures used in vision science research, rooting each in visualization examples. We then discuss the advantages and limitations of each technique. Researchers can use this design space to create innovative studies and progress scientific understanding of design choices and evaluations in visualization. We highlight a history of collaborative success between visualization and vision science research and advocate for a deeper relationship between the two fields that can elaborate on and extend the methodological design space for understanding visualization and vision.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9237132/","LOCKED","9237132","The University of British Columbia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086617608","1","Madison A.

"Dynamic networks-networks that change over time-can be categorized into two types: offline dynamic networks, where all states of the network are known, and online dynamic networks, where only the past states of the network are known. Research on staging animated transitions in dynamic networks has focused more on offline data, where rendering strategies can take into account past and future states of the network. Rendering online dynamic networks is a more challenging problem since it requires a balance between timeliness for monitoring tasks-so that the animations do not lag too far behind the events-and clarity for comprehension tasks-to minimize simultaneous changes that may be difficult to follow. To illustrate the challenges placed by these requirements, we explore three strategies to stage animations for online dynamic networks: time-based, event-based, and a new hybrid approach that we introduce by combining the advantages of the first two. We illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy in representing low- and high-throughput data and conduct a user study involving monitoring and comprehension of dynamic networks. We also conduct a follow-up, think-aloud study combining monitoring and comprehension with experts in dynamic network visualization. Our findings show that animation staging strategies that emphasize comprehension do better for participant response times and accuracy. However, the notion of “comprehension” is not always clear when it comes to complex changes in highly dynamic networks, requiring some iteration in staging that the hybrid approach affords. Based on our results, we make recommendations for balancing event-based and time-based parameters for our hybrid approach.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9231268/","LOCKED","9231268","University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37597152500","1","Tarik Crnovrsanin","37597152500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100249","2","Shilpika","37087100249","University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086388430","3","Senthil Chandrasegaran","37086388430","University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085432740","4","Kwan-Liu Ma","37085432740","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030385","549","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9231268/","Dynamic networks","graph visualization","animation","mental map","user study","","","","","","Animation","Layout","Dynamics","Monitoring","Visualization","Real-time systems","Task analysis","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9231268","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","87","539","Staged Animation Strategies for Online Dynamic Networks","27"
"Small multiples are miniature representations of visual information used generically across many domains. Handling large numbers of small multiples imposes challenges on many analytic tasks like inspection, comparison, navigation, or annotation. To address these challenges, we developed a framework and implemented a library called PILlNG.JS for designing interactive piling interfaces. Based on the piling metaphor, such interfaces afford flexible organization, exploration, and comparison of large numbers of small multiples by interactively aggregating visual objects into piles. Based on a systematic analysis of previous work, we present a structured design space to guide the design of visual piling interfaces. To enable designers to efficiently build their own visual piling interfaces, PILlNG.JS provides a declarative interface to avoid having to write low-level code and implements common aspects of the design space. An accompanying GUI additionally supports the dynamic configuration of the piling interface. We demonstrate the expressiveness of PILlNG.JS with examples from machine learning, immunofluorescence microscopy, genomics, and public health.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216572/","LOCKED","9216572","Cambridge, Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, MA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086215204","1","Fritz Lekschas","37086215204","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656939","2","Xinyi Zhou","37088656939","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","3","Wei Chen","37291847800","Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37972937500","4","Nils Gehlenborg","37972937500","University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085687578","5","Benjamin Bach","37085687578","Cambridge, Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, MA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","6","Hanspeter Pfister","37275698100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028948","368","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216572/","Information visualization","small multiples","interactive piling","visual aggregation","spatial organization","","","","","","Visualization","Organizations","Task analysis","Data visualization","Encoding","Libraries","Aggregates","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9216572","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","88","358","A Generic Framework and Library for Exploration of Small Multiples through Interactive Piling","27"
"With the rapid development of online education in recent years, there has been an increasing number of learning platforms that provide students with multi-step questions to cultivate their problem-solving skills. To guarantee the high quality of such learning materials, question designers need to inspect how students' problem-solving processes unfold step by step to infer whether students' problem-solving logic matches their design intent. They also need to compare the behaviors of different groups (e.g., students from different grades) to distribute questions to students with the right level of knowledge. The availability of fine-grained interaction data, such as mouse movement trajectories from the online platforms, provides the opportunity to analyze problem-solving behaviors. However, it is still challenging to interpret, summarize, and compare the high dimensional problem-solving sequence data. In this paper, we present a visual analytics system, QLens, to help question designers inspect detailed problem-solving trajectories, compare different student groups, distill insights for design improvements. In particular, QLens models problem-solving behavior as a hybrid state transition graph and visualizes it through a novel glyph-embedded Sankey diagram, which reflects students' problem-solving logic, engagement, and encountered difficulties. We conduct three case studies and three expert interviews to demonstrate the usefulness of QLens on real-world datasets that consist of thousands of problem-solving traces.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222360/","LOCKED","9222360","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088276720","1","Meng Xia","37088276720","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656910","2","Reshika Palaniyappan Velumani","37088656910","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085635207","3","Yong Wang","37085635207","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","4","Huamin Qu","37272637300","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085504538","5","Xiaojuan Ma","37085504538","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030337","880","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222360/","Learning Behavior Analysis","Visual Analytics","Time Series Data","","","","","","","","Problem-solving","Hidden Markov models","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Task analysis","Programming","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222360","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","89","870","QLens: Visual Analytics of MUlti-step Problem-solving Behaviors for Improving Question Design","27"
"Collaborative exploration of scientific data sets across large high-resolution displays requires both high visual detail as well as low-latency transfer of image data (oftentimes inducing the need to trade one for the other). In this work, we present a system that dynamically adapts the encoding quality in such systems in a way that reduces the required bandwidth without impacting the details perceived by one or more observers. Humans perceive sharp, colourful details, in the small foveal region around the centre of the field of view, while information in the periphery is perceived blurred and colourless. We account for this by tracking the gaze of observers, and respectively adapting the quality parameter of each macroblock used by the H.264 encoder, considering the so-called visual acuity fall-off. This allows to substantially reduce the required bandwidth with barely noticeable changes in visual quality, which is crucial for collaborative analysis across display walls at different locations. We demonstrate the reduced overall required bandwidth and the high quality inside the foveated regions using particle rendering and parallel coordinates.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224182/","LOCKED","9224182","University of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085901206","1","Florian Frieß","37085901206","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086386153","2","Matthias Braun","37086386153","University of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086553797","3","Valentin Bruder","37086553797","University of Groningen","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37553894500","4","Steffen Frey","37553894500","University of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37287276500","5","Guido Reina","37287276500","University of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085368197","6","Thomas Ertl","37085368197","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030445","1859","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224182/","Large high-resolution displays","Fovetaed Encoding","Remote Visualisation","","","","","","","","Visualization","Bandwidth","Encoding","Streaming media","Image coding","Hardware","Computational modeling","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9224182","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","90","1850","Foveated Encoding for Large High-Resolution Displays","27"
"Density map is an effective visualization technique for depicting the scalar field distribution in 2D space. Conventional methods for constructing density maps are mainly based on Euclidean distance, limiting their applicability in urban analysis that shall consider road network and urban traffic. In this work, we propose a new method named Topology Density Map, targeting for accurate and intuitive density maps in the context of urban environment. Based on the various constraints of road connections and traffic conditions, the method first constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that propagates nonlinear scalar fields along 1D road networks. Next, the method extends the scalar fields to a 2D space by identifying key intersecting points in the DAG and calculating the scalar fields for every point, yielding a weighted Voronoi diagram like effect of space division. Two case studies demonstrate that the Topology Density Map supplies accurate information to users and provides an intuitive visualization for decision making. An interview with domain experts demonstrates the feasibility, usability, and effectiveness of our method.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222248/","LOCKED","9222248","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656735","1","Zezheng Feng","37088656735","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086556186","2","Haotian Li","37086556186","Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101788","3","Wei Zeng","37087101788","Southern University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088543738","4","Shuang-Hua Yang","37088543738","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","5","Huamin Qu","37272637300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030469","838","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222248/","Density map","network topology","urban data","","","","","","","","Roads","Topology","Data visualization","Estimation","Network topology","Urban areas","Two dimensional displays","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222248","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","91","828","Topology Density Map for Urban Data Visualization and Analysis","27"
"Geological analysis of 3D Digital Outcrop Models (DOMs) for reconstruction of ancient habitable environments is a key aspect of the upcoming ESA ExoMars 2022 Rosalind Franklin Rover and the NASA 2020 Rover Perseverance missions in seeking signs of past life on Mars. Geologists measure and interpret 3D DOMs, create sedimentary logs and combine them in ‘correlation panels’ to map the extents of key geological horizons, and build a stratigraphic model to understand their position in the ancient landscape. Currently, the creation of correlation panels is completely manual and therefore time-consuming, and inflexible. With InCorr we present a visualization solution that encompasses a 3D logging tool and an interactive data-driven correlation panel that evolves with the stratigraphic analysis. For the creation of InCorr we closely cooperated with leading planetary geologists in the form of a design study. We verify our results by recreating an existing correlation analysis with InCorr and validate our correlation panel against a manually created illustration. Further, we conducted a user-study with a wider circle of geologists. Our evaluation shows that InCorr efficiently supports the domain experts in tackling their research questions and that it has the potential to significantly impact how geologists work with digital outcrop representations in general.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9234473/","LOCKED","9234473","VRVis Zentrum fur Virtual Reality und Visualisierung Forschungs-GmbH","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085762833","1","Thomas Ortner","37085762833","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Imperial College London","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102461","2","Andreas Walch","37087102461","VRVis Zentrum fur Virtual Reality und Visualisierung Forschungs-GmbH","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655715","3","Rebecca Nowak","37088655715","Imperial College London","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656695","4","Robert Barnes","37088656695","TU Delft","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37846851700","5","Thomas Höllt","37846851700","Technische Universitat Wien","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282552200","6","M.

"Multiple-view visualization (MV) is a layout design technique often employed to help users see a large number of data attributes and values in a single cohesive representation. Because of its generalizability, the MV design has been widely adopted by the visualization community to help users examine and interact with large, complex, and high-dimensional data. However, although ubiquitous, there has been little work to categorize and analyze MVs in order to better understand its design space. As a result, there has been little to no guideline in how to use the MV design effectively. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of how MVs are designed in practice. We focus on two fundamental measures of multiple-view patterns: composition, which quantifies what view types and how many are there; and configuration, which characterizes spatial arrangement of view layouts in the display space. We build a new dataset containing 360 images of MVs collected from IEEE VIS, EuroVis, and PacificVis publications 2011 to 2019, and make fine-grained annotations of view types and layouts for these visualization images. From this data we conduct composition and configuration analyses using quantitative metrics of term frequency and layout topology. We identify common practices around MVs, including relationship of view types, popular view layouts, and correlation between view types and layouts. We combine the findings into a MV recommendation system, providing interactive tools to explore the design space, and support example-based design.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222323/","LOCKED","9222323","Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655526","1","Xi Chen","37088655526","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101788","2","Wei Zeng","37087101788","Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656676","3","Yanna Lin","37088656676","Bangor University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656693","4","Hayder Mahdi AI-maneea","37088656693","Bangor University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278794800","5","Jonathan Roberts","37278794800","Tufts University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","6","Remco Chang","37592409400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030338","1524","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222323/","Multiple views","design pattern","quantitative analysis","example-based design","","","","","","","Data visualization","Layout","Visualization","Tools","Task analysis","Guidelines","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222323","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","93","1514","Composition and Configuration Patterns in Multiple-View Visualizations","27"
"Inspired by data comics, this paper introduces a novel format for reporting controlled studies in the domain of human-computer interaction (HCI). While many studies in HCI follow similar steps in explaining hypotheses, laying out a study design, and reporting results, many of these decisions are buried in blocks of dense scientific text. We propose leveraging data comics as study reports to provide an open and glanceable view of studies by tightly integrating text and images, illustrating design decisions and key insights visually, resulting in visual narratives that can be compelling to non-scientists and researchers alike. Use cases of data comics study reports range from illustrations for non-scientific audiences to graphical abstracts, study summaries, technical talks, textbooks, teaching, blogs, supplementary submission material, and inclusion in scientific articles. This paper provides examples of data comics study reports alongside a graphical repertoire of examples, embedded in a framework of guidelines for creating comics reports which was iterated upon and evaluated through a series of collaborative design sessions.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222287/","LOCKED","9222287","The University of Edinburgh","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655932","1","Zezhong Wang","37088655932","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Stanford University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100276","2","Jacob Ritchie","37087100276","The University of Edinburgh and Tianjin University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655445","3","Jingtao Zhou","37088655445","University of Toronto","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395495900","4","Fanny Chevalier","37395495900","The University of Edinburgh","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085687578","5","Benjamin Bach","37085687578","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030433","977","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222287/","Statistical communication","comics","scientific reports","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Visualization","Human computer interaction","Guidelines","Jacobian matrices","Blogs","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222287","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","94","967","Data Comics for Reporting Controlled User Studies in Human-Computer Interaction","27"
"In this paper, we present a novel data structure, called the Mixture Graph. This data structure allows us to compress, render, and query segmentation histograms. Such histograms arise when building a mipmap of a volume containing segmentation IDs. Each voxel in the histogram mipmap contains a convex combination (mixture) of segmentation IDs. Each mixture represents the distribution of IDs in the respective voxel's children. Our method factorizes these mixtures into a series of linear interpolations between exactly two segmentation IDs. The result is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose nodes are topologically ordered. Pruning replicate nodes in the tree followed by compression allows us to store the resulting data structure efficiently. During rendering, transfer functions are propagated from sources (leafs) through the DAG to allow for efficient, pre-filtered rendering at interactive frame rates. Assembly of histogram contributions across the footprint of a given volume allows us to efficiently query partial histograms, achieving up to 178 x speed-up over naive parallelized range queries. Additionally, we apply the Mixture Graph to compute correctly pre-filtered volume lighting and to interactively explore segments based on shape, geometry, and orientation using multi-dimensional transfer functions.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224646/","LOCKED","9224646","Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), College of Science and Engineering (CSE), Education City, Doha, Qatar","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656200","1","Khaled Ai- Thelaya","37088656200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), College of Science and Engineering (CSE), Education City, Doha, Qatar","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37991435500","2","Marco Agus","37991435500","Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), College of Science and Engineering (CSE), Education City, Doha, Qatar","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37560044500","3","Jens Schneider","37560044500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030451","655","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224646/","Segmented Volumes","Data Structures","Sparse Data","","","","","","","","Rendering (computer graphics)","Histograms","Data structures","Semantics","Encoding","Transfer functions","Interpolation","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9224646","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","95","645","The Mixture Graph-A Data Structure for Compressing, Rendering, and Querying Segmentation Histograms","27"
"We present an approach called VisCode for embedding information into visualization images. This technology can implicitly embed data information specified by the user into a visualization while ensuring that the encoded visualization image is not distorted. The VisCode framework is based on a deep neural network. We propose to use visualization images and QR codes data as training data and design a robust deep encoder-decoder network. The designed model considers the salient features of visualization images to reduce the explicit visual loss caused by encoding. To further support large-scale encoding and decoding, we consider the characteristics of information visualization and propose a saliency-based QR code layout algorithm. We present a variety of practical applications of VisCode in the context of information visualization and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the perceptual quality of encoding, decoding success rate, anti-attack capability, time performance, etc. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of VisCode.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222358/","LOCKED","9222358","School of Computer Science and TechnologyEast China Normal University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102179","1","Peiying Zhang","37087102179","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","School of Computer Science and TechnologyEast China Normal University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086945430","2","Chenhui Li","37086945430","School of Computer Science and TechnologyEast China Normal University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38008320400","3","Changbo Wang","38008320400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030343","336","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222358/","Information visualization","information steganography","autocoding","saliency detection","visualization retargeting","","","","","","Data visualization","Visualization","Decoding","Image coding","Encoding","Image color analysis","Media","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222358","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","96","326","VisCode: Embedding Information in Visualization Images using Encoder-Decoder Network","27"
"Efficient optimisation algorithms have become important tools for finding high-quality solutions to hard, real-world problems such as production scheduling, timetabling, or vehicle routing. These algorithms are typically “black boxes” that work on mathematical models of the problem to solve. However, many problems are difficult to fully specify, and require a “human in the loop” who collaborates with the algorithm by refining the model and guiding the search to produce acceptable solutions. Recently, the Problem-Solving Loop was introduced as a high-level model of such interactive optimisation. Here, we present and evaluate nine recommendations for the design of interactive visualisation tools supporting the Problem-Solving Loop. They range from the choice of visual representation for solutions and constraints to the use of a solution gallery to support exploration of alternate solutions. We first examined the applicability of the recommendations by investigating how well they had been supported in previous interactive optimisation tools. We then evaluated the recommendations in the context of the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). To do so we built a sophisticated interactive visual system for solving VRPTW that was informed by the recommendations. Ten participants then used this system to solve a variety of routing problems. We report on participant comments and interaction patterns with the tool. These showed the tool was regarded as highly usable and the results generally supported the usefulness of the underlying recommendations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9241744/","LOCKED","9241744","Monash University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086255317","1","Jie Liu","37086255317","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Monash University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326161000","2","Tim Dwyer","37326161000","Monash University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085891841","3","Guido Tack","37085891841","Monash University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077342300","4","Samuel Gratzl","37077342300","Monash University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37354163600","5","Kim Marriott","37354163600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030364","1774","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9241744/","Interactive optimisation","Interface design","Usability","Interactive systems and tools","Vehicle routing","","","","","","Optimization","Tools","Task analysis","Mathematical model","Problem-solving","Visual analytics","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9241744","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","97","1764","Supporting the Problem-Solving Loop: Designing Highly Interactive Optimisation Systems","27"
"Mission designers must study many dynamical models to plan a low-cost spacecraft trajectory that satisfies mission constraints. They routinely use Poincare maps to search for a suitable path through the interconnected web of periodic orbits and invariant manifolds found in multi-body gravitational systems. This paper is concerned with the extraction and interactive visual exploration of this structural landscape to assist spacecraft trajectory planning. We propose algorithmic solutions that address the specific challenges posed by the characterization of the topology in astrodynamics problems and allow for an effective visual analysis of the resulting information. This visualization framework is applied to the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP), where it reveals novel periodic orbits with their relevant invariant manifolds in a suitable format for interactive transfer selection. Representative design problems illustrate how spacecraft path planners can leverage our topology visualization to fully exploit the natural dynamics pathways for energy-efficient trajectory designs.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222254/","LOCKED","9222254","Computer Science at Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282575100","1","Xavier Tricoche","37282575100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mission Design EngineerJHU Applied Physics Lab","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655686","2","Wayne Schlei","37088655686","Astronautics at Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655840","3","Kathleen C.

"Deep learning's great success motivates many practitioners and students to learn about this exciting technology. However, it is often challenging for beginners to take their first step due to the complexity of understanding and applying deep learning. We present CNN Explainer, an interactive visualization tool designed for non-experts to learn and examine convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a foundational deep learning model architecture. Our tool addresses key challenges that novices face while learning about CNNs, which we identify from interviews with instructors and a survey with past students. CNN Explainer tightly integrates a model overview that summarizes a CNN's structure, and on-demand, dynamic visual explanation views that help users understand the underlying components of CNNs. Through smooth transitions across levels of abstraction, our tool enables users to inspect the interplay between low-level mathematical operations and high-level model structures. A qualitative user study shows that CNN Explainer helps users more easily understand the inner workings of CNNs, and is engaging and enjoyable to use. We also derive design lessons from our study. Developed using modern web technologies, CNN Explainer runs locally in users' web browsers without the need for installation or specialized hardware, broadening the public's education access to modern deep learning techniques.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222325/","LOCKED","9222325","Georgia Tech.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088660889","1","Zijie J.

"Recent graphical interfaces offer direct manipulation mechanisms for authoring visualizations, but are largely restricted to static output. To author interactive visualizations, users must instead turn to textual specification, but such approaches impose a higher technical burden. To bridge this gap, we introduce Lyra 2, a system that extends a prior visualization design environment with novel methods for authoring interaction techniques by demonstration. Users perform an interaction (e.g., button clicks, drags, or key presses) directly on the visualization they are editing. The system interprets this performance using a set of heuristics and enumerates suggestions of possible interaction designs. These heuristics account for the properties of the interaction (e.g., target and event type) as well as the visualization (e.g., mark and scale types, and multiple views). Interaction design suggestions are displayed as thumbnails; users can preview and test these suggestions, iteratively refine them through additional demonstrations, and finally apply and customize them via property inspectors. We evaluate our approach through a gallery of diverse examples, and evaluate its usability through a first-use study and via an analysis of its cognitive dimensions. We find that, in Lyra 2, interaction design by demonstration enables users to rapidly express a wide range of interactive visualizations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222289/","LOCKED","9222289","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655897","1","Jonathan Zong","37088655897","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655805","2","Dhiraj Barnwal","37088655805","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655444","3","Rupayan Neogy","37088655444","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085729682","4","Arvind Satyanarayan","37085729682","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030367","314","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222289/","Direct manipulation","interactive visualization","interaction design by demonstration","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Visualization","Brushes","Programming","Image color analysis","Usability","Tools","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222289","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","100","304","Lyra 2: Designing Interactive Visualizations by Demonstration","27"
"Over the last decade growing amounts of government data have been made available in an attempt to increase transparency and civic participation, but it is unclear if this data serves non-expert communities due to gaps in access and the technical knowledge needed to interpret this “open” data. We conducted a two-year design study focused on the creation of a community-based data display using the United States Environmental Protection Agency data on water permit violations by oil storage facilities on the Chelsea Creek in Massachusetts to explore whether situated data physicalization and Participatory Action Research could support meaningful engagement with open data. We selected this data as it is of interest to local groups and available online, yet remains largely invisible and inaccessible to the Chelsea community. The resulting installation, Chemicals in the Creek, responds to the call for community-engaged visualization processes and provides an application of situated methods of data representation. It proposes event-centered and power-aware modes of engagement using contextual and embodied data representations. The design of Chemicals in the Creek is grounded in interactive workshops and we analyze it through event observation, interviews, and community outcomes. We reflect on the role of community engaged research in the Information Visualization community relative to recent conversations on new approaches to design studies and evaluation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9233460/","LOCKED","9233460","MIT Media LabArt+Design at Northeastern University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088640457","1","Laura J.

"Information visualization (infovis) is a powerful tool for exploring rich datasets. Within humanistic research, rich qualitative data and domain culture make traditional infovis approaches appear reductive and disconnected, leading to low adoption. In this paper, we use a multi-step approach to scrutinize the relationship between infovis and the humanities and suggest new directions for it. We first look into infovis from the humanistic perspective by exploring the humanistic literature around infovis.

Then, we translate our findings into guidelines for designers and conduct a design critique exercise to explore their effect on the perception of humanist researchers.

"Static scatterplots often suffer from the overdraw problem on big datasets where object overlap causes undesirable visual clutter. The use of zooming in scatterplots can help alleviate this problem. With multiple zoom levels, more screen real estate is available, allowing objects to be placed in a less crowded way. We call this type of visualization scalable scatterplot visualizations, or SSV for short. Despite the potential of SSVs, existing systems and toolkits fall short in supporting the authoring of SSVs due to three limitations. First, many systems have limited scalability, assuming that data fits in the memory of one computer. Second, too much developer work, e.g., using custom code to generate mark layouts or render objects, is required. Third, many systems focus on only a small subset of the SSV design space (e.g. supporting a specific type of visual marks). To address these limitations, we have developed Kyrix-S, a system for easy authoring of SSVs at scale. Kyrix-S derives a declarative grammar that enables specification of a variety of SSVs in a few tens of lines of code, based on an existing survey of scatterplot tasks and designs. The declarative grammar is supported by a distributed layout algorithm which automatically places visual marks onto zoom levels. We store data in a multi-node database and use multi-node spatial indexes to achieve interactive browsing of large SSVs. Extensive experiments show that 1) Kyrix-S enables interactive browsing of SSVs of billions of objects, with response times under 500ms and 2) Kyrix-S achieves 4X-9X reduction in specification compared to a state-of-the-art authoring system.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222038/","LOCKED","9222038","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656072","1","Wenbo Tao","37088656072","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655534","2","Xinli Hou","37088655534","Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37654091400","3","Adam Sah","37654091400","University of Maryland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086366223","4","Leilani Battle","37086366223","Tufts University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","5","Remco Chang","37592409400","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38315553400","6","Michael Stonebraker","38315553400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030372","411","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222038/","pan/zoom visualization","declarative grammar","scalability","performance optimization","","","","","","","Visualization","Data visualization","Layout","Grammar","Scalability","Semantics","Heating systems","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222038","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","103","401","Kyrix-S: Authoring Scalable Scatterplot Visualizations of Big Data","27"
"Visualization designs typically need to be evaluated with user studies, because their suitability for a particular task is hard to predict. What the field of visualization is currently lacking are theories and models that can be used to explain why certain designs work and others do not. This paper outlines a general framework for modeling visualization processes that can serve as the first step towards such a theory. It surveys related research in mathematical and computational psychology and argues for the use of dynamic Bayesian networks to describe these time-dependent, probabilistic processes. It is discussed how these models could be used to aid in design evaluation. The development of concrete models will be a long process. Thus, the paper outlines a research program sketching how to develop prototypes and their extensions from existing models, controlled experiments, and observational studies.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229135/","LOCKED","9229135","Leipzig University, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37410427900","1","Christian Heine","37410427900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030395","1010","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229135/","Visualization","model building","perception","cognition","dynamic Bayesian networks","","","","","","Visualization","Computational modeling","Mathematical model","Task analysis","Predictive models","Guidelines","Cognition","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9229135","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","104","1000","Towards Modeling Visualization Processes as Dynamic Bayesian Networks","27"
"Uncertainty visualizations often emphasize point estimates to support magnitude estimates or decisions through visual comparison. However, when design choices emphasize means, users may overlook uncertainty information and misinterpret visual distance as a proxy for effect size. We present findings from a mixed design experiment on Mechanical Turk which tests eight uncertainty visualization designs: 95% containment intervals, hypothetical outcome plots, densities, and quantile dotplots, each with and without means added. We find that adding means to uncertainty visualizations has small biasing effects on both magnitude estimation and decision-making, consistent with discounting uncertainty. We also see that visualization designs that support the least biased effect size estimation do not support the best decision-making, suggesting that a chart user's sense of effect size may not necessarily be identical when they use the same information for different tasks. In a qualitative analysis of users' strategy descriptions, we find that many users switch strategies and do not employ an optimal strategy when one exists. Uncertainty visualizations which are optimally designed in theory may not be the most effective in practice because of the ways that users satisfice with heuristics, suggesting opportunities to better understand visualization effectiveness by modeling sets of potential strategies.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222364/","LOCKED","9222364","University of Washington","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543362","1","Alex Kale","37086543362","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Michigan","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085726054","2","Matthew Kay","37085726054","Northwestern University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016234500","3","Jessica Hullman","38016234500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030335","282","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222364/","Uncertainty visualization","graphical perception","data cognition","","","","","","","","Uncertainty","Visualization","Data visualization","Task analysis","Decision making","Estimation","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222364","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","105","272","Visual Reasoning Strategies for Effect Size Judgments and Decisions","27"
"Analyzing interaction data provides an opportunity to learn about users, uncover their underlying goals, and create intelligent visualization systems. The first step for intelligent response in visualizations is to enable computers to infer user goals and strategies through observing their interactions with a system. Researchers have proposed multiple techniques to model users, however, their frameworks often depend on the visualization design, interaction space, and dataset. Due to these dependencies, many techniques do not provide a general algorithmic solution to user exploration modeling. In this paper, we construct a series of models based on the dataset and pose user exploration modeling as a Bayesian model selection problem where we maintain a belief over numerous competing models that could explain user interactions. Each of these competing models represent an exploration strategy the user could adopt during a session. The goal of our technique is to make high-level and in-depth inferences about the user by observing their low-level interactions. Although our proposed idea is applicable to various probabilistic model spaces, we demonstrate a specific instance of encoding exploration patterns as competing models to infer information relevance. We validate our technique's ability to infer exploration bias, predict future interactions, and summarize an analytic session using user study datasets. Our results indicate that depending on the application, our method outperforms established baselines for bias detection and future interaction prediction. Finally, we discuss future research directions based on our proposed modeling paradigm and suggest how practitioners can use this method to build intelligent visualization systems that understand users' goals and adapt to improve the exploration process.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224186/","LOCKED","9224186","Washington University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655986","1","Shayan Monadjemi","37088655986","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Washington University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37560994400","2","Roman Garnett","37560994400","Washington University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38513524100","3","Alvitta Ottley","38513524100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030430","421","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224186/","User Interaction Modeling","Bayesian Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Hidden Markov models","Data models","Visual analytics","Analytical models","Bayes methods","Task analysis","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9224186","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","106","412","Competing Models: Inferring Exploration Patterns and Information Relevance via Bayesian Model Selection","27"
"Node-link diagrams are widely used to visualise networks. However, even the best network layout algorithms ultimately result in ‘hairball’ visualisations when the graph reaches a certain degree of complexity, requiring simplification through aggregation or interaction (such as filtering) to remain usable. Until now, there has been little data to indicate at what level of complexity node-link diagrams become ineffective or how visual complexity affects cognitive load. To this end, we conducted a controlled study to understand workload limits for a task that requires a detailed understanding of the network topology-finding the shortest path between two nodes. We tested performance on graphs with 25 to 175 nodes with varying density. We collected performance measures (accuracy and response time), subjective feedback, and physiological measures (EEG, pupil dilation, and heart rate variability). To the best of our knowledge this is the first network visualisation study to include physiological measures. Our results show that people have significant difficulty finding the shortest path in high density node-link diagrams with more than 50 nodes and even low density graphs with more than 100 nodes. From our collected EEG data we observe functional differences in brain activity between hard and easy tasks. We found that cognitive load increased up to certain level of difficulty after which it decreased, likely because participants had given up. We also explored the effects of global network layout features such as size or number of crossings, and features of the shortest path such as length or straightness on task difficulty. We found that global features generally had a greater impact than those of the shortest path.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9290431/","LOCKED","9290431","Department of Human-Centred Computing, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085607171","1","Vahan Yoghourdjian","37085607171","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Human-Centred Computing, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085820538","2","Yalong Yang","37085820538","Department of Human-Centred Computing, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326161000","3","Tim Dwyer","37326161000","Faculty of Business and Economics, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656306","4","Lee Lawrence","37088656306","Department of Human-Centred Computing, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37867777700","5","Michael Wybrow","37867777700","Department of Human-Centred Computing, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37354163600","6","Kim Marriott","37354163600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030459","1687","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9290431/","Data Visualisation","Network Visualisation","Cognitive Load","EEG","","","","","","","Task analysis","Data visualization","Particle measurements","Atmospheric measurements","Electroencephalography","Visualization","Physiology","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9290431","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","107","1677","Scalability of Network Visualisation from a Cognitive Load Perspective","27"
"Color mapping is a foundational technique for visualizing scalar data. Prior literature offers guidelines for effective colormap design, such as emphasizing luminance variation while limiting changes in hue. However, empirical studies of color are largely focused on perceptual tasks. This narrow focus inhibits our understanding of how generalizable these guidelines are, particularly to tasks like visual inference that require synthesis and judgement across multiple percepts. Furthermore, the emphasis on traditional ramp designs (e.g., sequential or diverging) may sideline other key metrics or design strategies. We study how a cognitive metric-color name variation-impacts people's ability to make model-based judgments. In two graphical inference experiments, participants saw a series of color-coded scalar fields sampled from different models and assessed the relationships between these models. Contrary to conventional guidelines, participants were more accurate when viewing colormaps that cross a variety of uniquely nameable colors. We modeled participants' performance using this metric and found that it provides a better fit to the experimental data than do existing design principles. Our findings indicate cognitive advantages for colorful maps like rainbow, which exhibit high color categorization, despite their traditionally undesirable perceptual properties. We also found no evidence that color categorization would lead observers to infer false data features. Our results provide empirically grounded metrics for predicting a colormap's performance and suggest alternative guidelines for designing new quantitative colormaps to support inference.

"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated extraordinarily good performance in many computer vision tasks. The increasing size of CNN models, however, prevents them from being widely deployed to devices with limited computational resources, e.g., mobile/embedded devices. The emerging topic of model pruning strives to address this problem by removing less important neurons and fine-tuning the pruned networks to minimize the accuracy loss. Nevertheless, existing automated pruning solutions often rely on a numerical threshold of the pruning criteria, lacking the flexibility to optimally balance the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, the complicated interplay between the stages of neuron pruning and model fine-tuning makes this process opaque, and therefore becomes difficult to optimize. In this paper, we address these challenges through a visual analytics approach, named CNNPruner. It considers the importance of convolutional filters through both instability and sensitivity, and allows users to interactively create pruning plans according to a desired goal on model size or accuracy. Also, CNNPruner integrates state-of-the-art filter visualization techniques to help users understand the roles that different filters played and refine their pruning plans. Through comprehensive case studies on CNNs with real-world sizes, we validate the effectiveness of CNNPruner.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222510/","LOCKED","9222510","Computer Network Information CenterChinese Academy of Sciences","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088396085","1","Guan Li","37088396085","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Visa Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655885","2","Junpeng Wang","37088655885","Ohio State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","3","Han-Wei Shen","37279493500","Computer Network Information CenterChinese Academy of Sciences","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656726","4","Kaixin Chen","37088656726","Computer Network Information CenterChinese Academy of Sciences","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395012300","5","Guihua Shan","37395012300","Computer Network Information CenterChinese Academy of Sciences","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37535424600","6","Zhonghua Lu","37535424600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030461","1373","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222510/","visualization","model pruning","convolutional neural network","explainable artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Computational modeling","Numerical models","Analytical models","Visual analytics","Predictive models","Deep learning","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222510","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","109","1364","CNNPruner: Pruning Convolutional Neural Networks with Visual Analytics","27"
"Advances in language modeling have led to the development of deep attention-based models that are performant across a wide variety of natural language processing (NLP) problems. These language models are typified by a pre-training process on large unlabeled text corpora and subsequently fine-tuned for specific tasks. Although considerable work has been devoted to understanding the attention mechanisms of pre-trained models, it is less understood how a model's attention mechanisms change when trained for a target NLP task. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach to understanding fine-tuning in attention-based language models. Our visualization, Attention Flows, is designed to support users in querying, tracing, and comparing attention within layers, across layers, and amongst attention heads in Transformer-based language models. To help users gain insight on how a classification decision is made, our design is centered on depicting classification-based attention at the deepest layer and how attention from prior layers flows throughout words in the input. Attention Flows supports the analysis of a single model, as well as the visual comparison between pre-trained and fine-tuned models via their similarities and differences. We use Attention Flows to study attention mechanisms in various sentence understanding tasks and highlight how attention evolves to address the nuances of solving these tasks.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224153/","LOCKED","9224153","Vanderbilt University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656472","1","Joseph F.

"Scatterplots are used for a variety of visual analytics tasks, including cluster identification, and the visual encodings used on a scatterplot play a deciding role on the level of visual separation of clusters. For visualization designers, optimizing the visual encodings is crucial to maximizing the clarity of data. This requires accurately modeling human perception of cluster separation, which remains challenging. We present a multi-stage user study focusing on four factors-distribution size of clusters, number of points, size of points, and opacity of points-that influence cluster identification in scatterplots. From these parameters, we have constructed two models, a distance-based model, and a density-based model, using the merge tree data structure from Topological Data Analysis. Our analysis demonstrates that these factors play an important role in the number of clusters perceived, and it verifies that the distance-based and density-based models can reasonably estimate the number of clusters a user observes. Finally, we demonstrate how these models can be used to optimize visual encodings on real-world data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222295/","LOCKED","9222295","University of South Florida","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086556695","1","Ghulam Jilani Quadri","37086556695","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of South Florida","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398611400","2","Paul Rosen","37398611400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030365","1839","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222295/","Scatterplot","clustering","perception","empirical evaluation","visual encoding","crowdsourcing","topological data analysis","","","","Visualization","Task analysis","Data models","Encoding","Data visualization","Analytical models","Computational modeling","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222295","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","111","1829","Modeling the Influence of Visual Density on Cluster Perception in Scatterplots Using Topology","27"
"As of today, data analysis focuses primarily on the findings to be made inside the data and concentrates less on how those findings relate to the domain of investigation. Contemporary visualization as a field of research shows a strong tendency to adopt this data-centrism. Despite their decisive influence on the analysis result, qualitative aspects of the analysis process such as the structure, soundness, and complexity of the applied reasoning strategy are rarely discussed explicitly. We argue that if the purpose of visualization is the provision of domain insight rather than the depiction of data analysis results, a holistic perspective requires a qualitative component to to be added to the discussion of quantitative and human factors. To support this point, we demonstrate how considerations of qualitative factors in visual analysis can be applied to obtain explanations and possible solutions for a number of practical limitations inherent to the data-centric perspective on analysis. Based on this discussion of what we call qualitative visual analysis, we develop an inside-outside principle of nested levels of context that can serve as a conceptual basis for the development of visualization systems that optimally support the emergence of insight during analysis.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9241426/","LOCKED","9241426","Federal Criminal Police Office, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086476607","1","Benjamin Karer","37086476607","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TU Kaiserslautern","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282578800","2","Hans Hagen","37282578800","Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601992200","3","Dirk J.

"Given a scatterplot with tens of thousands of points or even more, a natural question is which sampling method should be used to create a small but “good” scatterplot for a better abstraction. We present the results of a user study that investigates the influence of different sampling strategies on multi-class scatterplots. The main goal of this study is to understand the capability of sampling methods in preserving the density, outliers, and overall shape of a scatterplot. To this end, we comprehensively review the literature and select seven typical sampling strategies as well as eight representative datasets. We then design four experiments to understand the performance of different strategies in maintaining: 1) region density; 2) class density; 3) outliers; and 4) overall shape in the sampling results. The results show that: 1) random sampling is preferred for preserving region density; 2) blue noise sampling and random sampling have comparable performance with the three multi-class sampling strategies in preserving class density; 3) outlier biased density based sampling, recursive subdivision based sampling, and blue noise sampling perform the best in keeping outliers; and 4) blue noise sampling outperforms the others in maintaining the overall shape of a scatterplot.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9226404/","LOCKED","9226404","BNRist, Tsinghua University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088514945","1","Jun Yuan","37088514945","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BNRist, Tsinghua University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087500773","2","Shouxing Xiang","37087500773","Central South University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37531405500","3","Jiazhi Xia","37531405500","Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656670","4","Lingyun Yu","37088656670","BNRist, Tsinghua University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085444480","5","Shixia Liu","37085444480","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030432","1730","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9226404/","Scatterplot","data sampling","empirical evaluation","","","","","","","","Sampling methods","Task analysis","Shape","Data visualization","Visualization","Bibliographies","Scalability","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9226404","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","113","1720","Evaluation of Sampling Methods for Scatterplots","27"
"We propose MetroSets, a new, flexible online tool for visualizing set systems using the metro map metaphor. We model a given set system as a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}=(V,\ \mathcal{S})$, consisting of a set $V$ of vertices and a set $\mathcal{S}$, which contains subsets of $V$ called hyperedges. Our system then computes a metro map representation of $\mathcal{H}$, where each hyperedge $E$ in $\mathcal{S}$ corresponds to a metro line and each vertex corresponds to a metro station. Vertices that appear in two or more hyperedges are drawn as interchanges in the metro map, connecting the different sets. MetroSets is based on a modular 4-step pipeline which constructs and optimizes a path-based hypergraph support, which is then drawn and schematized using metro map layout algorithms. We propose and implement multiple algorithms for each step of the MetroSet pipeline and provide a functional prototype with easy-to-use preset configurations. Furthermore, using several real-world datasets, we perform an extensive quantitative evaluation of the impact of different pipeline stages on desirable properties of the generated maps, such as octolinearity, monotonicity, and edge uniformity.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224192/","LOCKED","9224192","University of Arizona","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656640","1","Ben Jacobsen","37088656640","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TU Wien","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656289","2","Markus Wallinger","37088656289","TU Wien","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398749700","3","Stephen Kobourov","37398749700","University of Arizona","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396024700","4","Martin Nöllenburg","37396024700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030475","1267","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224192/","Set visualization","metro map metaphor","hypergraphs","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Layout","Pipelines","Fats","Task analysis","Visual analytics","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9224192","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","114","1257","MetroSets: Visualizing Sets as Metro Maps","27"
"Computing and visualizing features in fluid flow often depends on the observer, or reference frame, relative to which the input velocity field is given. A desired property of feature detectors is therefore that they are objective, meaning independent of the input reference frame. However, the standard definition of objectivity is only given for Euclidean domains and cannot be applied in curved spaces. We build on methods from mathematical physics and Riemannian geometry to generalize objectivity to curved spaces, using the powerful notion of symmetry groups as the basis for definition. From this, we develop a general mathematical framework for the objective computation of observer fields for curved spaces, relative to which other computed measures become objective. An important property of our framework is that it works intrinsically in 2D, instead of in the 3D ambient space. This enables a direct generalization of the 2D computation via optimization of observer fields in flat space to curved domains, without having to perform optimization in 3D. We specifically develop the case of unsteady 2D geophysical flows given on spheres, such as the Earth. Our observer fields in curved spaces then enable objective feature computation as well as the visualization of the time evolution of scalar and vector fields, such that the automatically computed reference frames follow moving structures like vortices in a way that makes them appear to be steady.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222512/","LOCKED","9222512","Visual Computing Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37828701300","1","Peter Rautek","37828701300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Visual Computing Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545548","2","Matej Mlejnek","37086545548","Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37409575800","3","Johanna Beyer","37409575800","Visual Computing Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656277","4","Jakob Troidl","37088656277","Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","5","Hanspeter Pfister","37275698100","Core Labs, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655546","6","Thomas Theußl","37088655546","Visual Computing Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37394809600","7","Markus Hadwiger","37394809600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030454","293","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222512/","Flow visualization","observer fields","frames of reference","objectivity","symmetry groups","intrinsic covariant derivatives","","","","","Observers","Visualization","Two dimensional displays","Three-dimensional displays","Manifolds","Hurricanes","Earth","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222512","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","115","283","Objective Observer-Relative Flow Visualization in Curved Spaces for Unsteady 2D Geophysical Flows","27"
"We contribute MobileVisFixer, a new method to make visualizations more mobile-friendly. Although mobile devices have become the primary means of accessing information on the web, many existing visualizations are not optimized for small screens and can lead to a frustrating user experience. Currently, practitioners and researchers have to engage in a tedious and time-consuming process to ensure that their designs scale to screens of different sizes, and existing toolkits and libraries provide little support in diagnosing and repairing issues. To address this challenge, MobileVisFixer automates a mobile-friendly visualization re-design process with a novel reinforcement learning framework. To inform the design of MobileVisFixer, we first collected and analyzed SVG-based visualizations on the web, and identified five common mobile-friendly issues. MobileVisFixer addresses four of these issues on single-view Cartesian visualizations with linear or discrete scales by a Markov Decision Process model that is both generalizable across various visualizations and fully explainable. MobileVisFixer deconstructs charts into declarative formats, and uses a greedy heuristic based on Policy Gradient methods to find solutions to this difficult, multi-criteria optimization problem in reasonable time. In addition, MobileVisFixer can be easily extended with the incorporation of optimization algorithms for data visualizations. Quantitative evaluation on two real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and generalizability of our method.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229072/","LOCKED","9229072","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086808853","1","Aoyu Wu","37086808853","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656908","2","Wai Tong","37088656908","Monash University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326161000","3","Tim Dwyer","37326161000","Microsoft Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","4","Bongshin Lee","37293389400","Inria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","5","Petra Isenberg","37591317800","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","6","Huamin Qu","37272637300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030423","474","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229072/","Mobile visualization","Responsive visualization","Machine learning for visualizations","Reinforcement learning","","","","","","","Data visualization","Visualization","Mobile handsets","Sociology","Statistics","Encoding","Layout","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9229072","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","116","464","MobileVisFixer: Tailoring Web Visualizations for Mobile Phones Leveraging an Explainable Reinforcement Learning Framework","27"
"Visual data stories shown in the form of narrative visualizations such as a poster or a data video, are frequently used in data-oriented storytelling to facilitate the understanding and memorization of the story content. Although useful, technique barriers, such as data analysis, visualization, and scripting, make the generation of a visual data story difficult. Existing authoring tools rely on users' skills and experiences, which are usually inefficient and still difficult. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual data story generating system, Calliope, which creates visual data stories from an input spreadsheet through an automatic process and facilities the easy revision of the generated story based on an online story editor. Particularly, Calliope incorporates a new logic-oriented Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that explores the data space given by the input spreadsheet to progressively generate story pieces (i.e., data facts) and organize them in a logical order. The importance of data facts is measured based on information theory, and each data fact is visualized in a chart and captioned by an automatically generated description. We evaluate the proposed technique through three example stories, two controlled experiments, and a series of interviews with 10 domain experts. Our evaluation shows that Calliope is beneficial to efficient visual data story generation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222368/","LOCKED","9222368","Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087406084","1","Danqing Shi","37087406084","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087405128","2","Xinyue Xu","37087405128","Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656468","3","Fuling Sun","37088656468","Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086368227","4","Yang Shi","37086368227","Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085734033","5","Nan Cao","37085734033","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030403","463","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222368/","Information Visualization","Visual Storytelling","Data Story","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Visualization","Space exploration","Tools","Authoring systems","Market research","Data models","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222368","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","117","453","Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet","27"
"Graph mining plays a pivotal role across a number of disciplines, and a variety of algorithms have been developed to answer who/what type questions. For example, what items shall we recommend to a given user on an e-commerce platform? The answers to such questions are typically returned in the form of a ranked list, and graph-based ranking methods are widely used in industrial information retrieval settings. However, these ranking algorithms have a variety of sensitivities, and even small changes in rank can lead to vast reductions in product sales and page hits. As such, there is a need for tools and methods that can help model developers and analysts explore the sensitivities of graph ranking algorithms with respect to perturbations within the graph structure. In this paper, we present a visual analytics framework for explaining and exploring the sensitivity of any graph-based ranking algorithm by performing perturbation-based what-if analysis. We demonstrate our framework through three case studies inspecting the sensitivity of two classic graph-based ranking algorithms (PageRank and HITS) as applied to rankings in political news media and social networks.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216512/","LOCKED","9216512","Arizona State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101871","1","Tiankai Xie","37087101871","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Arizona State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101494","2","Yuxin Ma","37087101494","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656449","3","Hanghang Tong","37088656449","University of Florida","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37394239100","4","My T.

"Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement (Structured AMR) enables simulations to adapt the domain resolution to save computation and storage, and has become one of the dominant data representations used by scientific simulations; however, efficiently rendering such data remains a challenge. We present an efficient approach for volume- and iso-surface ray tracing of Structured AMR data on GPU-equipped workstations, using a combination of two different data structures. Together, these data structures allow a ray tracing based renderer to quickly determine which segments along the ray need to be integrated and at what frequency, while also providing quick access to all data values required for a smooth sample reconstruction kernel. Our method makes use of the RTX ray tracing hardware for surface rendering, ray marching, space skipping, and adaptive sampling; and allows for interactive changes to the transfer function and implicit iso-surfacing thresholds. We demonstrate that our method achieves high performance with little memory overhead, enabling interactive high quality rendering of complex AMR data sets on individual GPU workstations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222372/","LOCKED","9222372","NVIDIA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282958300","1","Ingo Wald","37282958300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","NVIDIA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087079401","2","Stefan Zellmann","37087079401","NVIDIA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085735276","3","Will Usher","37085735276","NVIDIA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087129005","4","Nate Morrical","37087129005","NVIDIA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681696700","5","Ulrich Lang","37681696700","NVIDIA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284312600","6","Valerio Pascucci","37284312600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030470","634","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222372/","Adaptive mesh refinement","acceleration data structures","volume rendering","hardware ray tracing","","","","","","","Rendering (computer graphics)","Computational modeling","Ray tracing","Data models","Adaptation models","Octrees","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222372","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","119","625","Ray Tracing Structured AMR Data Using ExaBricks","27"
"We present a nonparametric statistical framework for the quantification, analysis, and propagation of data uncertainty in direct volume rendering (DVR). The state-of-the-art statistical DVR framework allows for preserving the transfer function (TF) of the ground truth function when visualizing uncertain data; however, the existing framework is restricted to parametric models of uncertainty. In this paper, we address the limitations of the existing DVR framework by extending the DVR framework for nonparametric distributions. We exploit the quantile interpolation technique to derive probability distributions representing uncertainty in viewing-ray sample intensities in closed form, which allows for accurate and efficient computation. We evaluate our proposed nonparametric statistical models through qualitative and quantitative comparisons with the mean-field and parametric statistical models, such as uniform and Gaussian, as well as Gaussian mixtures. In addition, we present an extension of the state-of-the-art rendering parametric framework to 2D TFs for improved DVR classifications. We show the applicability of our uncertainty quantification framework to ensemble, downsampled, and bivariate versions of scalar field datasets.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224194/","LOCKED","9224194","University of Utah, Scientific Computing & Imaging (SCI) Institute, Salt Lake City","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077916100","1","Tushar M.

We created Argus, a tool that supports interactive exploration of statistical power: Researchers specify experiment design scenarios with varying confounds and effect sizes.

"We propose a visualization application, designed for the exploration of human spine simulation data. Our goal is to support research in biomechanical spine simulation and advance efforts to implement simulation-backed analysis in surgical applications. Biomechanical simulation is a state-of-the-art technique for analyzing load distributions of spinal structures. Through the inclusion of patient-specific data, such simulations may facilitate personalized treatment and customized surgical interventions. Difficulties in spine modelling and simulation can be partly attributed to poor result representation, which may also be a hindrance when introducing such techniques into a clinical environment. Comparisons of measurements across multiple similar anatomical structures and the integration of temporal data make commonly available diagrams and charts insufficient for an intuitive and systematic display of results. Therefore, we facilitate methods such as multiple coordinated views, abstraction and focus and context to display simulation outcomes in a dedicated tool. $\mathrm{By}$   linking the result data with patient-specific anatomy, we make relevant parameters tangible for clinicians. Furthermore, we introduce new concepts to show the directions of impact force vectors, which were not accessible before. We integrated our toolset into a spine segmentation and simulation pipeline and evaluated our methods with both surgeons and biomechanical researchers. When comparing our methods against standard representations that are currently in use, we found increases in accuracy and speed in data exploration tasks. $\mathrm{in}$   a qualitative review, domain experts deemed the tool highly useful when dealing with simulation result data, which typically combines time-dependent patient movement and the resulting force distributions on spinal structures.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222085/","LOCKED","9222085","University of Jena, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099469","1","Pepe Eulzer","37087099469","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086793138","2","Sabine Bauer","37086793138","Department of Spine Surgery, Cath.

"A biological understanding is key for managing medical conditions, yet psychological and social aspects matter too. The main problem is that these two aspects are hard to quantify and inherently difficult to communicate. To quantify psychological aspects, this work mined around half a million Reddit posts in the sub-communities specialised in 14 medical conditions, and it did so with a new deep-learning framework. In so doing, it was able to associate mentions of medical conditions with those of emotions. To then quantify social aspects, this work designed a probabilistic approach that mines open prescription data from the National Health Service in England to compute the prevalence of drug prescriptions, and to relate such a prevalence to census data. To finally visually communicate each medical condition's biological, psychological, and social aspects through storytelling, we designed a narrative-style layered Martini Glass visualization. In a user study involving 52 participants, after interacting with our visualization, a considerable number of them changed their mind on previously held opinions: 10% gave more importance to the psychological aspects of medical conditions, and 27% were more favourable to the use of social media data in healthcare, suggesting the importance of persuasive elements in interactive visualizations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222264/","LOCKED","9222264","Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, US","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088541126","1","Wonyoung So","37088541126","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chair of Cartography, Technical University of Munich (DE)","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088540815","2","Edyta P.

"Many data abstraction types, such as networks or set relationships, remain unfamiliar to data workers beyond the visualization research community. We conduct a survey and series of interviews about how people describe their data, either directly or indirectly. We refer to the latter as latent data abstractions. We conduct a Grounded Theory analysis that (1) interprets the extent to which latent data abstractions exist, (2) reveals the far-reaching effects that the interventionist pursuit of such abstractions can have on data workers, (3) describes why and when data workers may resist such explorations, and (4) suggests how to take advantage of opportunities and mitigate risks through transparency about visualization research perspectives and agendas. We then use the themes and codes discovered in the Grounded Theory analysis to develop guidelines for data abstraction in visualization projects. To continue the discussion, we make our dataset open along with a visual interface for further exploration.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9246308/","LOCKED","9246308","University of Arizona","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085905494","1","Alex Bigelow","37085905494","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Arizona","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086638338","2","Katy Williams","37086638338","University of Arizona","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490580100","3","Katherine E.

"Storyline visualizations are an effective means to present the evolution of plots and reveal the scenic interactions among characters. However, the design of storyline visualizations is a difficult task as users need to balance between aesthetic goals and narrative constraints. Despite that the optimization-based methods have been improved significantly in terms of producing aesthetic and legible layouts, the existing (semi-) automatic methods are still limited regarding 1) efficient exploration of the storyline design space and 2) flexible customization of storyline layouts. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning framework to train an AI agent that assists users in exploring the design space efficiently and generating well-optimized storylines. Based on the framework, we introduce PlotThread, an authoring tool that integrates a set of flexible interactions to support easy customization of storyline visualizations. To seamlessly integrate the AI agent into the authoring process, we employ a mixed-initiative approach where both the agent and designers work on the same canvas to boost the collaborative design of storylines. We evaluate the reinforcement learning model through qualitative and quantitative experiments and demonstrate the usage of PlotThread using a collection of use cases.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222335/","LOCKED","9222335","Zhejiang Lab and State Key Lab of CAD&CGZhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543321","1","Tan Tang","37086543321","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Zhejiang Lab and State Key Lab of CAD&CGZhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656403","2","Renzhong Li","37088656403","Zhejiang Lab and State Key Lab of CAD&CGZhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656779","3","Xinke Wu","37088656779","Zhejiang Lab and State Key Lab of CAD&CGZhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656249","4","Shuhan Liu","37088656249","VIS/VISUSUniversity of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087498883","5","Johannes Knittel","37087498883","VIS/VISUSUniversity of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593029700","6","Steffen Koch","37593029700","Department of Computer Science and Software EngineeringXi 'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593898200","7","Lingyun Yu","37593898200","Alibaba Group","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655630","8","Peiran Ren","37088655630","VIS/VISUSUniversity of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085368197","9","Thomas Ertl","37085368197","Zhejiang Lab and State Key Lab of CAD&CGZhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085393659","10","Yingcai Wu","37085393659","1","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030467","303","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222335/","Storyline visualization","reinforcement learning","mixed-initiative design","","","","","","","","Layout","Visualization","Reinforcement learning","Collaboration","Task analysis","Optimization","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222335","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","125","294","PlotThread: Creating Expressive Storyline Visualizations using Reinforcement Learning","27"
"Grid maps are spatial arrangements of simple tiles (often squares or hexagons), each of which represents a spatial element. They are an established, effective way to show complex data per spatial element, using visual encodings within each tile ranging from simple coloring to nested small-multiples visualizations. An effective grid map is coherent with the underlying geographic space: the tiles maintain the contiguity, neighborhoods and identifiability of the corresponding spatial elements, while the grid map as a whole maintains the global shape of the input. Of particular importance are salient local features of the global shape which need to be represented by tiles assigned to the appropriate spatial elements. State-of-the-art techniques can adequately deal only with simple cases, such as close-to-uniform spatial distributions or global shapes that have few characteristic features. We introduce a simple fully-automated 3-step pipeline for computing coherent grid maps. Each step is a well-studied problem: shape decomposition based on salient features, tile-based Mosaic Cartograms, and point-set matching. Our pipeline is a seamless composition of existing techniques for these problems and results in high-quality grid maps. We provide an implementation, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on various complex datasets, and compare it to the state-of-the-art.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216586/","LOCKED","9216586","TU Eindhoven","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073861100","1","Wouter Meulemans","37073861100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TU Eindhoven","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086219178","2","Max Sondag","37086219178","TU Eindhoven","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591266000","3","Bettina Speckmann","37591266000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028953","1246","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216586/","Grid maps","algorithms","tile maps","small multiples","geovisualization","","","","","","Shape","Topology","Pipelines","Coherence","Data visualization","Visualization","Geometry","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9216586","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","126","1236","A Simple Pipeline for Coherent Grid Maps","27"
"Abstract-We propose a data-driven space-filling curve method for 2D and 3D visualization. Our flexible curve traverses the data elements in the spatial domain in a way that the resulting linearization better preserves features in space compared to existing methods. We achieve such data coherency by calculating a Hamiltonian path that approximately minimizes an objective function that describes the similarity of data values and location coherency in a neighborhood. Our extended variant even supports multiscale data via quadtrees and octrees. Our method is useful in many areas of visualization including multivariate or comparative visualization ensemble visualization of 2D and 3D data on regular grids or multiscale visual analysis of particle simulations. The effectiveness of our method is evaluated with numerical comparisons to existing techniques and through examples of ensemble and multivariate datasets.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222374/","LOCKED","9222374","National Institute of Health Data Science, Peking University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073908100","1","Liang Zhou","37073908100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SCI Institute, University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276931400","2","Chris R.

"This paper presents a visual analytics system for exploring, analyzing and comparing argument structures in essay corpora. We provide an overview of the corpus by a list of ArguLines which represent the argument units of each essay by a sequence of glyphs. Each glyph encodes the stance, the depth and the relative position of an argument unit. The overview can be ordered in various ways to reveal patterns and outliers. Subsets of essays can be selected and analyzed in detail using the Argument Unit Occurrence Tree which aggregates the argument structures using hierarchical histograms. This hierarchical view facilitates the estimation of statistics and trends concerning the progression of the argumentation in the essays. It also provides insights into the commonalities and differences between selected subsets. The text view is the necessary textual basis to verify conclusions from the other views and the annotation process. Linking the views and interaction techniques for visual filtering, studying the evolution of stance within a subset of essays and scrutinizing the order of argumentative units enable a deep analysis of essay corpora. Our expert reviews confirmed the utility of the system and revealed detailed and previously unknown information about the argumentation in our sample corpus.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222553/","LOCKED","9222553","Bauhaus-Universität Weimar","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086696433","1","Dora Kiesel","37086696433","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bauhaus-Universität Weimar","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38262580000","2","Patrick Riehmann","38262580000","Paderborn University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656814","3","Henning Wachsmuth","37088656814","Bauhaus-Universität Weimar","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605608600","4","Benno Stein","37605608600","Bauhaus-Universität Weimar","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282977500","5","Bernd Froehlich","37282977500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030425","1148","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222553/","Information Visualization","Text Analysis","User Interfaces","Visual Analytics","Argumentation Visualization","Glyph-based Techniques","Text and Document Data","Tree-based Visualization","Coordinated and Multiple Views","Close and Distant Reading","Task analysis","Annotations","Skin","Visual analytics","Histograms","Data visualization","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222553","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","128","1139","Visual Analysis of Argumentation in Essays","27"
"This paper introduces Polyphorm, an interactive visualization and model fitting tool that provides a novel approach for investigating cosmological datasets. Through a fast computational simulation method inspired by the behavior of Physarum polycephalum, an unicellular slime mold organism that efficiently forages for nutrients, astrophysicists are able to extrapolate from sparse datasets, such as galaxy maps archived in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and then use these extrapolations to inform analyses of a wide range of other data, such as spectroscopic observations captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. Researchers can interactively update the simulation by adjusting model parameters, and then investigate the resulting visual output to form hypotheses about the data. We describe details of Polyphorm's simulation model and its interaction and visualization modalities, and we evaluate Polyphorm through three scientific use cases that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9240061/","LOCKED","9240061","Dept. of Computational Media, University of California, Santa Cruz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38667473900","1","Oskar Elek","38667473900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dept. of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of California, Santa Cruz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655628","2","Joseph N.

"Modern automobiles have evolved from just being mechanical machines to having full-fledged electronics systems that enhance vehicle dynamics and driver experience. However, these complex hardware and software systems, if not properly designed, can experience failures that can compromise the safety of the vehicle, its occupants, and the surrounding environment. For example, a system to activate the brakes to avoid a collision saves lives when it functions properly, but could lead to tragic outcomes if the brakes were applied in a way that's inconsistent with the design. Broadly speaking, the analysis performed to minimize such risks falls into a systems engineering domain called Functional Safety. In this paper, we present SafetyLens, a visual data analysis tool to assist engineers and analysts in analyzing automotive Functional Safety datasets. SafetyLens combines techniques including network exploration and visual comparison to help analysts perform domain-specific tasks. This paper presents the design study with domain experts that resulted in the design guidelines, the tool, and user feedback.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222266/","LOCKED","9222266","Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087083944","1","Arpit Narechania","37087083944","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ford Motor Company","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37890708900","2","Ahsan Qamar","37890708900","Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681759500","3","Alex Endert","37681759500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030382","1697","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222266/","Visual data analysis","Design study","Network visualization","Functional safety","Automotive engineering","","","","","","Hazards","Acceleration","Visualization","Automotive engineering","Brakes","Tools","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222266","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","130","1688","SafetyLens: Visual Data Analysis of Functional Safety of Vehicles","27"
"Information visualization research has developed powerful systems that enable users to author custom data visualizations without textual programming. These systems can support graphics-driven practices by bridging lazy data-binding mechanisms with vector-graphics editing tools. Yet, despite their expressive power, visualization authoring systems often assume that users want to generate visual representations that they already have in mind rather than explore designs. They also impose a data-to-graphics workflow, where binding data dimensions to graphical properties is a necessary step for generating visualization layouts. In this paper, we introduce StructGraphics, an approach for creating data-agnostic and fully reusable visualization designs. StructGraphics enables designers to construct visualization designs by drawing graphics on a canvas and then structuring their visual properties without relying on a concrete dataset or data schema. In StructGraphics, tabular data structures are derived directly from the structure of the graphics. Later, designers can link these structures with real datasets through a spreadsheet user interface. StructGraphics supports the design and reuse of complex data visualizations by combining graphical property sharing, by-example design specification, and persistent layout constraints. We demonstrate the power of the approach through a gallery of visualization examples and reflect on its strengths and limitations in interaction with graphic designers and data visualization experts.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222091/","LOCKED","9222091","Inria & CNRS, Université Paris-Saclay, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085357220","1","Theophanis Tsandilas","37085357220","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030476","325","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222091/","Visualization design","graphical structures","visualization grammars","layout constraints","infographics","flexible data binding","","","","","Data visualization","Layout","Visualization","Tools","Programming","Task analysis","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222091","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","131","315","StructGraphics: Flexible Visualization Design through Data-Agnostic and Reusable Graphical Structures","27"
"3D Lines are a widespread rendering primitive for the visualization of data from research fields like fluid dynamics or fiber tractography. Global illumination effects and transparent rendering improve the perception of three-dimensional features and decrease occlusion within the data set, thus enabling better understanding of complex line data. We present an efficient approach for high quality GPU-based rendering of line data with ambient occlusion and transparency effects. Our approach builds on GPU-based raycasting of rounded cones, which are geometric primitives similar to truncated cones, but with spherical endcaps. Object space ambient occlusion is provided by an efficient voxel cone tracing approach. Our core contribution is a new fragment visibility sorting strategy that allows for interactive visualization of line data sets with millions of line segments. We improve performance further by exploiting hierarchical opacity maps.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216549/","LOCKED","9216549","Chair of Computer Graphics & Visualization, TU-Dresden, Dresden, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656043","1","David Groß","37088656043","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chair of Computer Graphics & Visualization, TU-Dresden, Dresden, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37565742800","2","Stefan Gumhold","37565742800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028954","624","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216549/","Scientific visualization","ray-casting","line rendering","transparency","","","","","","","Rendering (computer graphics)","Geometry","Lighting","Data visualization","Electron tubes","Casting","Graphics processing units","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9216549","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","132","614","Advanced Rendering of Line Data with Ambient Occlusion and Transparency","27"
"Many processes, from gene interaction in biology to computer networks to social media, can be modeled more precisely as temporal hypergraphs than by regular graphs. This is because hypergraphs generalize graphs by extending edges to connect any number of vertices, allowing complex relationships to be described more accurately and predict their behavior over time. However, the interactive exploration and seamless refinement of such hypergraph-based prediction models still pose a major challenge. We contribute Hyper-Matrix, a novel visual analytics technique that addresses this challenge through a tight coupling between machine-learning and interactive visualizations. In particular, the technique incorporates a geometric deep learning model as a blueprint for problem-specific models while integrating visualizations for graph-based and category-based data with a novel combination of interactions for an effective user-driven exploration of hypergraph models. To eliminate demanding context switches and ensure scalability, our matrix-based visualization provides drill-down capabilities across multiple levels of semantic zoom, from an overview of model predictions down to the content. We facilitate a focused analysis of relevant connections and groups based on interactive user-steering for filtering and search tasks, a dynamically modifiable partition hierarchy, various matrix reordering techniques, and interactive model feedback. We evaluate our technique in a case study and through formative evaluation with law enforcement experts using real-world internet forum communication data. The results show that our approach surpasses existing solutions in terms of scalability and applicability, enables the incorporation of domain knowledge, and allows for fast search-space traversal. With the proposed technique, we pave the way for the visual analytics of temporal hypergraphs in a wide variety of domains.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222341/","LOCKED","9222341","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656787","1","Maximilian T.

By providing a declarative language for visual analytics, P6 can empower more developers to create visual analytics applications that combine machine learning and visualization methods for data analysis and problem solving.

"We present a novel deep learning based technique for volumetric ambient occlusion in the context of direct volume rendering. Our proposed Deep Volumetric Ambient Occlusion (DVAO) approach can predict per-voxel ambient occlusion in volumetric data sets, while considering global information provided through the transfer function. The proposed neural network only needs to be executed upon change of this global information, and thus supports real-time volume interaction. Accordingly, we demonstrate DVAO's ability to predict volumetric ambient occlusion, such that it can be applied interactively within direct volume rendering. To achieve the best possible results, we propose and analyze a variety of transfer function representations and injection strategies for deep neural networks. Based on the obtained results we also give recommendations applicable in similar volume learning scenarios. Lastly, we show that DVAO generalizes to a variety of modalities, despite being trained on computed tomography data only.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222376/","LOCKED","9222376","Ulm University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655910","1","Dominik Engel","37088655910","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ulm University and Linköping University, Norrköping","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295281400","2","Timo Ropinski","37295281400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030344","1278","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222376/","Volume illumination","deep learning","direct volume rendering","","","","","","","","Rendering (computer graphics)","Transfer functions","Lighting","Training","Three-dimensional displays","Neural networks","Deep learning","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222376","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","135","1268","Deep Volumetric Ambient Occlusion","27"
"Design study is an established approach of conducting problem-driven visualization research. The academic visualization community has produced a large body of work for reporting on design studies, informed by a handful of theoretical frameworks, and applied to a broad range of application areas. The result is an abundance of reported insights into visualization design, with an emphasis on novel visualization techniques and systems as the primary contribution of these studies. In recent work we proposed a new, interpretivist perspective on design study and six companion criteria for rigor that highlight the opportunities for researchers to contribute knowledge that extends beyond visualization idioms and software. In this work we conducted a year-long collaboration with evolutionary biologists to develop an interactive tool for visual exploration of multivariate datasets and phylogenetic trees. During this design study we experimented with methods to support three of the rigor criteria: ABUNDANT, REFLEXIVE, and TRANSPARENT. As a result we contribute two novel visualization techniques for the analysis of multivariate phylogenetic datasets, three methodological recommendations for conducting design studies drawn from reflections over our process of experimentation, and two writing devices for reporting interpretivist design study. We offer this work as an example for implementing the rigor criteria to produce a diverse range of knowledge contributions.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222089/","LOCKED","9222089","University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656265","1","Jen Rogers","37088656265","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Washington State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656394","2","Austin H.

"This paper describes a localized algorithm for the topological simplification of scalar data, an essential pre-processing step of topological data analysis (TDA). Given a scalar field $f$ and a selection of extrema to preserve, the proposed localized topological simplification (LTS) derives a function g that is close to $f$ and only exhibits the selected set of extrema. Specifically, sub- and superlevel set components associated with undesired extrema are first locally flattened and then correctly embedded into the global scalar field, such that these regions are guaranteed-from a combinatorial perspective-to no longer contain any undesired extrema. In contrast to previous global approaches, LTS only and independently processes regions of the domain that actually need to be simplified, which already results in a noticeable speedup. Moreover, due to the localized nature of the algorithm, LTS can utilize shared-memory parallelism to simplify regions simultaneously with a high parallel efficiency (70%). Hence, LTS significantly improves interactivity for the exploration of simplification parameters and their effect on subsequent topological analysis. For such exploration tasks, LTS brings the overall execution time of a plethora of TDA pipelines from minutes down to seconds, with an average observed speedup over state-of-the-art techniques of up to $\times 36$. Furthermore, in the special case where preserved extrema are selected based on topological persistence, an adapted version of LTS partially computes the persistence diagram and simultaneously simplifies features below a predefined persistence threshold. The effectiveness of LTS, its parallel efficiency, and its resulting benefits for TDA are demonstrated on several simulated and acquired datasets from different application domains, including physics, chemistry, and biomedical imaging.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222093/","LOCKED","9222093","Arizona State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086218677","1","Jonas Lukasczyk","37086218677","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universitat Kaiserslautern","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282573700","2","Christoph Garth","37282573700","Arizona State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","3","Ross Maciejewski","37396008400","Sorbonne Universite, CNRS","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37298870300","4","Julien Tierny","37298870300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030353","582","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222093/","Topological data analysis","scalar data","simplification","feature extraction","parallel computing","","","","","","Computational modeling","Parallel processing","Data visualization","Data analysis","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","Topology","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222093","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","137","572","Localized Topological Simplification of Scalar Data","27"
"The growing use of automated decision-making in critical applications, such as crime prediction and college admission, has raised questions about fairness in machine learning. How can we decide whether different treatments are reasonable or discriminatory? In this paper, we investigate discrimination in machine learning from a visual analytics perspective and propose an interactive visualization tool, DiscriLens, to support a more comprehensive analysis. To reveal detailed information on algorithmic discrimination, DiscriLens identifies a collection of potentially discriminatory itemsets based on causal modeling and classification rules mining. By combining an extended Euler diagram with a matrix-based visualization, we develop a novel set visualization to facilitate the exploration and interpretation of discriminatory itemsets. A user study shows that users can interpret the visually encoded information in DiscriLens quickly and accurately. Use cases demonstrate that DiscriLens provides informative guidance in understanding and reducing algorithmic discrimination.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222272/","LOCKED","9222272","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543277","1","Qianwen Wang","37086543277","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656714","2","Zhenhua Xu","37088656714","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085793208","3","Zhutian Chen","37085793208","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085635207","4","Yong Wang","37085635207","Tsinghua University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","5","Shixia Liu","37406039100","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","6","Huamin Qu","37272637300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030471","1480","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222272/","Machine Learning","Discrimination","Data Visualization","","","","","","","","Itemsets","Visualization","Data visualization","Tools","Machine learning","Data models","Predictive models","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222272","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","138","1470","Visual Analysis of Discrimination in Machine Learning","27"
"Online services are used for all kinds of activities, like news, entertainment, publishing content or connecting with others. But information technology enables new threats to privacy by means of global mass surveillance, vast databases and fast distribution networks. Current news are full of misuses and data leakages. In most cases, users are powerless in such situations and develop an attitude of neglect for their online behaviour. On the other hand, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) gives users the right to request a copy of all their personal data stored by a particular service, but the received data is hard to understand or analyze by the common internet user. This paper presents TransparencyVis - a web-based interface to support the visual and interactive exploration of data exports from different online services. With this approach, we aim at increasing the awareness of personal data stored by such online services and the effects of online behaviour. This design study provides an online accessible prototype and a best practice to unify data exports from different sources.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9246571/","LOCKED","9246571","Fraunhofer IGD, Darmstadt, TU, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086832096","1","Marija Schufrin","37086832096","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Fraunhofer IGD, Darmstadt, TU, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656455","2","Steven Lamarr Reynolds","37088656455","Fraunhofer IGD, Darmstadt, TU, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37270495600","3","Arjan Kuijper","37270495600","Fraunhofer IGD, Darmstadt, TU, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37449689200","4","Jorn Kohlhammer","37449689200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028946","1849","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9246571/","Information visualization","usable privacy","privacy awareness","transparency-enhancing technologies","user-centered design","","","","","","Data visualization","Tools","Data privacy","Privacy","Internet","Data collection","Social networking (online)","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9246571","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","139","1840","A Visualization Interface to Improve the Transparency of Collected Personal Data on the Internet","27"
"In machine learning (ML), ensemble methods-such as bagging, boosting, and stacking-are widely-established approaches that regularly achieve top-notch predictive performance. Stacking (also called “stacked generalization”) is an ensemble method that combines heterogeneous base models, arranged in at least one layer, and then employs another metamodel to summarize the predictions of those models. Although it may be a highly-effective approach for increasing the predictive performance of ML, generating a stack of models from scratch can be a cumbersome trial-and-error process. This challenge stems from the enormous space of available solutions, with different sets of data instances and features that could be used for training, several algorithms to choose from, and instantiations of these algorithms using diverse parameters (i.e., models) that perform differently according to various metrics. In this work, we present a knowledge generation model, which supports ensemble learning with the use of visualization, and a visual analytics system for stacked generalization. Our system, StackGenVis, assists users in dynamically adapting performance metrics, managing data instances, selecting the most important features for a given data set, choosing a set of top-performant and diverse algorithms, and measuring the predictive performance. In consequence, our proposed tool helps users to decide between distinct models and to reduce the complexity of the resulting stack by removing overpromising and underperforming models. The applicability and effectiveness of StackGenVis are demonstrated with two use cases: a real-world healthcare data set and a collection of data related to sentiment/stance detection in texts. Finally, the tool has been evaluated through interviews with three ML experts.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222343/","LOCKED","9222343","Linnaeus University, Växjö, Sweden","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086529537","1","Angelos Chatzimparmpas","37086529537","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Linnaeus University, Växjö, Sweden","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086180105","2","Rafael M.

"Data-driven problem solving in many real-world applications involves analysis of time-dependent multivariate data, for which dimensionality reduction (DR) methods are often used to uncover the intrinsic structure and features of the data. However, DR is usually applied to a subset of data that is either single-time-point multivariate or univariate time-series, resulting in the need to manually examine and correlate the DR results out of different data subsets. When the number of dimensions is large either in terms of the number of time points or attributes, this manual task becomes too tedious and infeasible. In this paper, we present MulTiDR, a new DR framework that enables processing of time-dependent multivariate data as a whole to provide a comprehensive overview of the data. With the framework, we employ DR in two steps. When treating the instances, time points, and attributes of the data as a 3D array, the first DR step reduces the three axes of the array to two, and the second DR step visualizes the data in a lower-dimensional space. In addition, by coupling with a contrastive learning method and interactive visualizations, our framework enhances analysts' ability to interpret DR results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework with four case studies using real-world datasets.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216630/","LOCKED","9216630","University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086133964","1","Takanori Fujiwara","37086133964","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100249","2","Shilpika","37087100249","Kobe University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086047311","3","Naohisa Sakamoto","37086047311","RIKEN R-CCS","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284313700","4","Jorji Nonaka","37284313700","RIKEN R-CCS","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656913","5","Keiji Yamamoto","37088656913","University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085432740","6","Kwan-Liu Ma","37085432740","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028889","1611","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216630/","Multivariate time-series","tensor","data cube","dimensionality reduction","interpretability","visual analytics","","","","","Tensile stress","Data visualization","Two dimensional displays","Principal component analysis","Three-dimensional displays","Dimensionality reduction","Arrays","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9216630","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","141","1601","A Visual Analytics Framework for Reviewing Multivariate Time-Series Data with Dimensionality Reduction","27"
"Investigating relationships between variables in multi-dimensional data sets is a common task for data analysts and engineers. More specifically, it is often valuable to understand which ranges of which input variables lead to particular values of a given target variable. Unfortunately, with an increasing number of independent variables, this process may become cumbersome and time-consuming due to the many possible combinations that have to be explored. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to visualize correlations between input variables and a target output variable that scales to hundreds of variables. We developed a visual model based on neural networks that can be explored in a guided way to help analysts find and understand such correlations. First, we train a neural network to predict the target from the input variables. Then, we visualize the inner workings of the resulting model to help understand relations within the data set. We further introduce a new regularization term for the backpropagation algorithm that encourages the neural network to learn representations that are easier to interpret visually. We apply our method to artificial and real-world data sets to show its utility.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222060/","LOCKED","9222060","University of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087498883","1","Johannes Knittel","37087498883","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656540","2","Andres Lalama","37088656540","University of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593029700","3","Steffen Koch","37593029700","University of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085368197","4","Thomas Ertl","37085368197","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030420","1384","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222060/","Visual Analytics","Multivariate Data Analysis","Machine Learning","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Visualization","Correlation","Analytical models","Input variables","Neural networks","Semiconductor device measurement","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222060","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","142","1374","Visual Neural Decomposition to Explain Multivariate Data Sets","27"
"In recent years, deep learning has opened countless research opportunities across many different disciplines. At present, visualization is mainly applied to explore and explain neural networks. Its counterpart-the application of deep learning to visualization problems-requires us to share data more openly in order to enable more scientists to engage in data-driven research. In this paper, we construct a large fluid flow data set and apply it to a deep learning problem in scientific visualization. Parameterized by the Reynolds number, the data set contains a wide spectrum of laminar and turbulent fluid flow regimes. The full data set was simulated on a high-performance compute cluster and contains 8000 time-dependent 2D vector fields, accumulating to more than 16 TB in size. Using our public fluid data set, we trained deep convolutional neural networks in order to set a benchmark for an improved post-hoc Lagrangian fluid flow analysis. In in-situ settings, flow maps are exported and interpolated in order to assess the transport characteristics of time-dependent fluids. Using deep learning, we improve the accuracy of flow map interpolations, allowing a more precise flow analysis at a reduced memory IO footprint.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216518/","LOCKED","9216518","ETH Zurich, Switzerland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656899","1","Jakob Jakob","37088656899","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ETH Zurich, Switzerland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275694700","2","Markus Gross","37275694700","ETH Zurich, Switzerland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085416142","3","Tobias Günther","37085416142","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028947","1289","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216518/","Scientific visualization","deep learning","flow maps","","","","","","","","Machine learning","Interpolation","Image resolution","Data visualization","Convolutional neural networks","Feature extraction","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9216518","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","143","1279","A Fluid Flow Data Set for Machine Learning and its Application to Neural Flow Map Interpolation","27"
"Bus routes are typically updated every 3–5 years to meet constantly changing travel demands. However, identifying deficient bus routes and finding their optimal replacements remain challenging due to the difficulties in analyzing a complex bus network and the large solution space comprising alternative routes. Most of the automated approaches cannot produce satisfactory results in real-world settings without laborious inspection and evaluation of the candidates. The limitations observed in these approaches motivate us to collaborate with domain experts and propose a visual analytics solution for the performance analysis and incremental planning of bus routes based on an existing bus network. Developing such a solution involves three major challenges, namely, a) the in-depth analysis of complex bus route networks, b) the interactive generation of improved route candidates, and c) the effective evaluation of alternative bus routes. For challenge a, we employ an overview-to-detail approach by dividing the analysis of a complex bus network into three levels to facilitate the efficient identification of deficient routes. For challenge b, we improve a route generation model and interpret the performance of the generation with tailored visualizations. For challenge c, we incorporate a conflict resolution strategy in the progressive decision-making process to assist users in evaluating the alternative routes and finding the most optimal one. The proposed system is evaluated with two usage scenarios based on real-world data and received positive feedback from the experts.

"Collaborative visual analytics leverages social interaction to support data exploration and sensemaking. These processes are typically imagined as formalised, extended activities, between groups of dedicated experts, requiring expertise with sophisticated data analysis tools. However, there are many professional domains that benefit from support for short 'bursts' of data exploration between a subset of stakeholders with a diverse breadth of knowledge. Such 'casual collaborative’ scenarios will require engaging features to draw users' attention, with intuitive, 'walk-up and use’ interfaces. This paper presents Uplift, a novel prototype system to support 'casual collaborative visual analytics' for a campus microgrid, co-designed with local stakeholders. An elicitation workshop with key members of the building management team revealed relevant knowledge is distributed among multiple experts in their team, each using bespoke analysis tools. Uplift combines an engaging 3D model on a central tabletop display with intuitive tangible interaction, as well as augmented-reality, mid-air data visualisation, in order to support casual collaborative visual analytics for this complex domain. Evaluations with expert stakeholders from the building management and energy domains were conducted during and following our prototype development and indicate that Uplift is successful as an engaging backdrop for casual collaboration.

"The collection and visual analysis of large-scale data from complex systems, such as electronic health records or clickstream data, has become increasingly common across a wide range of industries. This type of retrospective visual analysis, however, is prone to a variety of selection bias effects, especially for high-dimensional data where only a subset of dimensions is visualized at any given time. The risk of selection bias is even higher when analysts dynamically apply filters or perform grouping operations during ad hoc analyses. These bias effects threaten the validity and generalizability of insights discovered during visual analysis as the basis for decision making. Past work has focused on bias transparency, helping users understand when selection bias may have occurred. However, countering the effects of selection bias via bias mitigation is typically left for the user to accomplish as a separate process. Dynamic reweighting (DR) is a novel computational approach to selection bias mitigation that helps users craft bias-corrected visualizations. This paper describes the DR workflow, introduces key DR visualization designs, and presents statistical methods that support the DR process. Use cases from the medical domain, as well as findings from domain expert user interviews, are also reported.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9233264/","LOCKED","9233264","RENCI, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295624700","1","David Borland","37295624700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dept. of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101747","2","Jonathan Zhang","37087101747","Dept.of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655762","3","Smiti Kaul","37088655762","School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601397400","4","David Gotz","37601397400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030455","1491","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9233264/","Selection bias","bias mitigation","bias correction","high-dimensional visualization","cohort selection","medical informatics","","","","","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Tools","Interviews","Data collection","Medical diagnostic imaging","","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9233264","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","146","1481","Selection-Bias-Corrected Visualization via Dynamic Reweighting","27"
"Cloud-based visualization services have made visual analytics accessible to a much wider audience than ever before. Systems such as Tableau have started to amass increasingly large repositories of analytical knowledge in the form of interactive visualization workbooks. When shared, these collections can form a visual analytic knowledge base. However, as the size of a collection increases, so does the difficulty in finding relevant information. Content-based recommendation (CBR) systems could help analysts in finding and managing workbooks relevant to their interests. Toward this goal, we focus on text-based content that is representative of the subject matter of visualizations rather than the visual encodings and style. We discuss the challenges associated with creating a CBR based on visualization specifications and explore more concretely how to implement the relevance measures required using Tableau workbook specifications as the source of content data. We also demonstrate what information can be extracted from these visualization specifications and how various natural language processing techniques can be used to compute similarity between workbooks as one way to measure relevance. We report on a crowd-sourced user study to determine if our similarity measure mimics human judgement. Finally, we choose latent Dirichl et al.ocation (LDA) as a specific model and instantiate it in a proof-of-concept recommender tool to demonstrate the basic function of our similarity measure.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222280/","LOCKED","9222280","Tableau Research and the University of British Columbia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088642005","1","Michael Oppermann","37088642005","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Tableau Research (retired)","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587984100","2","Robert Kincaid","37587984100","University of British Columbia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349490300","3","Tamara Munzner","37349490300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030387","505","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222280/","visualization recommendation","content-based filtering","recommender systems","visualization workbook repositories","","","","","","","Data visualization","Visualization","Task analysis","Feature extraction","Encoding","Recommender systems","Natural language processing","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222280","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","147","495","VizCommender: Computing Text-Based Similarity in Visualization Repositories for Content-Based Recommendations","27"
"We describe MPSE: a Multi-Perspective Simultaneous Embedding method for visualizing high-dimensional data, based on multiple pairwise distances between the data points. Specifically, MPSE computes positions for the points in 3D and provides different views into the data by means of 2D projections (planes) that preserve each of the given distance matrices. We consider two versions of the problem: fixed projections and variable projections. MPSE with fixed projections takes as input a set of pairwise distance matrices defined on the data points, along with the same number of projections and embeds the points in 3D so that the pairwise distances are preserved in the given projections. MPSE with variable projections takes as input a set of pairwise distance matrices and embeds the points in 3D while also computing the appropriate projections that preserve the pairwise distances. The proposed approach can be useful in multiple scenarios: from creating simultaneous embedding of multiple graphs on the same set of vertices, to reconstructing a 3D object from multiple 2D snapshots, to analyzing data from multiple points of view. We provide a functional prototype of MPSE that is based on an adaptive and stochastic generalization of multi-dimensional scaling to multiple distances and multiple variable projections. We provide an extensive quantitative evaluation with datasets of different sizes and using different number of projections, as well as several examples that illustrate the quality of the resulting solutions.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9241407/","LOCKED","9241407","Computer Science DepartmentThe University of Arizona","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086528941","1","Md Iqbal Hossain","37086528941","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of MathematicsThe University of Arizona","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086150060","2","Vahan Huroyan","37086150060","Computer Science DepartmentThe University of Arizona","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398749700","3","Stephen Kobourov","37398749700","Department of MathematicsThe University of Arizona","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655575","4","Raymundo Navarrete","37088655575","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030373","1579","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9241407/","Graph visualization","Dimensionality reduction","Multidimensional scaling","Mental map preservation","","","","","","","Three-dimensional displays","Data visualization","Layout","Two dimensional displays","Visualization","Dimensionality reduction","Optimization","9340023","2160-9306","2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9241407","Feb. 2021","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2021","IEEE","148","1569","Multi-Perspective, Simultaneous Embedding","27"
"Matrix visualizations are a useful tool to provide a general overview of a graph's structure. For multivariate graphs, a remaining challenge is to cope with the attributes that are associated with nodes and edges. Addressing this challenge, we propose responsive matrix cells as a focus+context approach for embedding additional interactive views into a matrix. Responsive matrix cells are local zoomable regions of interest that provide auxiliary data exploration and editing facilities for multivariate graphs. They behave responsively by adapting their visual contents to the cell location, the available display space, and the user task. Responsive matrix cells enable users to reveal details about the graph, compare node and edge attributes, and edit data values directly in a matrix without resorting to external views or tools. We report the general design considerations for responsive matrix cells covering the visual and interactive means necessary to support a seamless data exploration and editing. Responsive matrix cells have been implemented in a web-based prototype based on which we demonstrate the utility of our approach. We describe a walk-through for the use case of analyzing a graph of soccer players and report on insights from a preliminary user feedback session.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9226461/","CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

"Many computer science disciplines (e.g., combinatorial optimization, natural language processing, and information retrieval) use standard or established test suites for evaluating algorithms. In visualization, similar approaches have been adopted in some areas (e.g., volume visualization), while user testimonies and empirical studies have been the dominant means of evaluation in most other areas, such as designing colormaps. In this paper, we propose to establish a test suite for evaluating the design of colormaps. With such a suite, the users can observe the effects when different continuous colormaps are applied to planar scalar fields that may exhibit various characteristic features, such as jumps, local extrema, ridge or valley lines, different distributions of scalar values, different gradients, different signal frequencies, different levels of noise, and so on. The suite also includes an expansible collection of real-world data sets including the most popular data for colormap testing in the visualization literature. The test suite has been integrated into a web-based application for creating continuous colormaps (https://ccctool.com/), facilitating close inter-operation between design and evaluation processes. This new facility complements traditional evaluation methods such as user testimonies and empirical studies.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216559/","LOCKED","9216559","University of Leipzig, Institute of Computer Science, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656928","1","P.
