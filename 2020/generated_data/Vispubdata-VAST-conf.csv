VAST-conf,2020,Visual Abstraction of Geographical Point Data with Spatial Autocorrelations,10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00011,60,71,Conferences,"Scatterplots are always employed to visualize geographical point datasets, which often suffer from an overdraw problem due to the increase of data sizes. A variety of sampling strategies have been proposed to reduce overdraw and visual clutter with the spatial densities of points taken into account. However, informative attributes associated with the points also play significant roles in the exploration of geographical datasets. In this paper, we propose an attribute-based abstraction method to simplify the cluttered visualization of large-scale geographical points. Spatial autocorrelations are utilized to measure the attribute relationships of points in local areas, and a novel attribute-based sampling model is designed to generate a subset of points to preserve both density and attribute characteristics of original geographical points. A set of visual designs and user-friendly interactions are implemented, enabling users to capture the spatial distribution of geographical points and get deeper insights into the attribute features across local areas. Case studies and quantitative comparisons based on the real-world datasets further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the abstraction and exploration of large-scale geographical point datasets.",,Zhiguang Zhou;Xinlong Zhang;Zhendong Yang;Yuanyuan Chen;Yuhua Liu;Jin Wen;Binjie Chen;Ying Zhao;Wei Chen,"Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics,School of Information;Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics,School of Information;Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics,School of Information;Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics,School of Information;Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics,School of Information;Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics,School of Information;Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics,School of Information;Central South University,School of Computer Sciences and Engineering;Zhejiang University,State Key Lab of CAD & CG",,"Visual Abstraction,Spatial Autocorrelation,Sampling,Geospatial Analysis,,,",,0,,
VAST-conf,2020,SMAP: A Joint Dimensionality Reduction Scheme for Secure Multi-Party Visualization,10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00015,107,118,Conferences,"Nowadays, as data becomes increasingly complex and distributed, data analyses often involve several related datasets that are stored on different servers and probably owned by different stakeholders. While there is an emerging need to provide these stakeholders with a full picture of their data under a global context, conventional visual analytical methods, such as dimensionality reduction, could expose data privacy when multi-party datasets are fused into a single site to build point-level relationships. In this paper, we reformulate the conventional t-SNE method from the single-site mode into a secure distributed infrastructure. We present a secure multi-party scheme for joint t-SNE computation, which can minimize the risk of data leakage. Aggregated visualization can be optionally employed to hide disclosure of point-level relationships. We build a prototype system based on our method, SMAP, to support the organization, computation, and exploration of secure joint embedding. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with three case studies, one of which is based on the deployment of our system in real-world applications.",,Jiazhi Xia;Tianxiang Chen;Lei Zhang;Wei Chen;Yang Chen;Xiaolong Zhang;Cong Xie;Tobias Schreck,"Central South University,School of Computer Science and Engineering;Central South University,School of Computer Science and Engineering;Central South University,School of Computer Science and Engineering;Zhejiang University,State Key Lab of CAD&CG;I4 data;Pennsylvania State University, University Park,PA;Facebook;Graz University of Technology",,"High-Dimensional Data Visualization,Secure Visualization,Dimensionality Reduction,Secure Multi-Party Computation,,,",,0,,
VAST-conf,2020,ConceptExplorer: Visual Analysis of Concept Drifts in Multi-source Time-series Data,10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00006,1,11,Conferences,"Time-series data is widely studied in various scenarios, like weather forecast, stock market, customer behavior analysis. To comprehensively learn about the dynamic environments, it is necessary to comprehend features from multiple data sources. This paper proposes a novel visual analysis approach for detecting and analyzing concept drifts from multi-sourced time-series. We propose a visual detection scheme for discovering concept drifts from multiple sourced time-series based on prediction models. We design a drift level index to depict the dynamics, and a consistency judgment model to justify whether the concept drifts from various sources are consistent. Our integrated visual interface, ConceptExplorer, facilitates visual exploration, extraction, understanding, and comparison of concepts and concept drifts from multi-source time-series data. We conduct three case studies and expert interviews to verify the effectiveness of our approach.",,Xumeng Wang;Wei Chen;Jiazhi Xia;Zexian Chen;Dongshi Xu;Xiangyang Wu;Mingliang Xu;Tobias Schreck,"Zhejiang University,State Key Lab of CAD&CG;Zhejiang University,State Key Lab of CAD&CG;Central South University,School of Computer Science and Engineering;Zhejiang University,State Key Lab of CAD&CG;China Jiliang University,College of Information Engineering;Institute of Graphics and Image Hangzhou Dianzi University;Zhengzhou University;Graz University of Technology",,"Temporal data; data analysis,reasoning,problem solving,and decision making; machine learning techniques,Temporal data,data analysis, reasoning, problem solving, and decision making,machine learning techniques",,0,,
VAST-conf,2020,Diagnosing Concept Drift with Visual Analytics,10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00007,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00007,12,23,Conferences,"Concept drift is a phenomenon in which the distribution of a data stream changes over time in unforeseen ways, causing prediction models built on historical data to become inaccurate. While a variety of automated methods have been developed to identify when concept drift occurs, there is limited support for analysts who need to understand and correct their models when drift is detected. In this paper, we present a visual analytics method, DriftVis, to support model builders and analysts in the identification and correction of concept drift in streaming data. DriftVis combines a distribution-based drift detection method with a streaming scatterplot to support the analysis of drift caused by the distribution changes of data streams and to explore the impact of these changes on the model’s accuracy. A quantitative experiment and two case studies on weather prediction and text classification have been conducted to demonstrate our proposed tool and illustrate how visual analytics can be used to support the detection, examination, and correction of concept drift.",,Weikai Yang;Zhen Li;Mengchen Liu;Yafeng Lu;Kelei Cao;Ross Maciejewski;Shixia Liu,"Tsinghua University,School of Software, BNRist;Tsinghua University,School of Software, BNRist;Microsoft;Bloomberg L.P.;Tsinghua University,School of Software, BNRist;Arizona State University,Computer Science;Tsinghua University,School of Software, BNRist",,"Concept drift,streaming data,change detection,scatterplot,t-SNE.,,",,0,,
VAST-conf,2020,STULL: Unbiased Online Sampling for Visual Exploration of Large Spatiotemporal Data,10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00012,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00012,72,83,Conferences,"Online sampling-supported visual analytics is increasingly important, as it allows users to explore large datasets with acceptable approximate answers at interactive rates. However, existing online spatiotemporal sampling techniques are often biased, as most researchers have primarily focused on reducing computational latency. Biased sampling approaches select data with unequal probabilities and produce results that do not match the exact data distribution, leading end users to incorrect interpretations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to perform unbiased online sampling of large spatiotemporal data. The proposed approach ensures the same probability of selection to every point that qualifies the specifications of a user’s multidimensional query. To achieve unbiased sampling for accurate representative interactive visualizations, we design a novel data index and an associated sample retrieval plan. Our proposed sampling approach is suitable for a wide variety of visual analytics tasks, e.g., tasks that run aggregate queries of spatiotemporal data. Extensive experiments confirm the superiority of our approach over a state-of-the-art spatial online sampling technique, demonstrating that within the same computational time, data samples generated in our approach are at least 50% more accurate in representing the actual spatial distribution of the data and enable approximate visualizations to present closer visual appearances to the exact ones.",,Guizhen Wang;Jingjing Guo;Mingjie Tang;José Florencio de Queiroz Neto;Calvin Yau;Anas Daghistani;Morteza Karimzadeh;Walid G.

VAST-conf,2020,iConViz: Interactive Visual Exploration of the Default Contagion Risk of Networked-Guarantee Loans,10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00013,84,94,Conferences,"Groups of enterprises can serve as guarantees for one another and form complex networks when obtaining loans from commercial banks. During economic slowdowns, corporate default may spread like a virus and lead to large-scale defaults or even systemic financial crises. To help financial regulatory authorities and banks manage the risk associated with networked loans, we identified the default contagion risk, a pivotal issue in developing preventive measures, and established iConViz, an interactive visual analysis tool that facilitates the closed-loop analysis process. A novel financial metric, the contagion effect, was formulated to quantify the infectious consequences of guarantee chains in this type of network. Based on this metric, we designed and implemented a series of novel and coordinated views that address the analysis of financial problems. Experts evaluated the system using real-world financial data. The proposed approach grants practitioners the ability to avoid previous ad hoc analysis methodologies and extend coverage of the conventional Capital Accord to the banking industry.",,Zhibin Niu;Runlin Li;Junqi Wu;Dawei Cheng;Jiawan Zhang,"Tianjin University,College of Intelligence and Computing;Tianjin University,College of Intelligence and Computing;Tianjin University,College of Intelligence and Computing;Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Department of Computer Science and Engineering;Tianjin University,College of Intelligence and Computing",,"Visualization analytics,Regulatory visualization,,,,,",,0,,
VAST-conf,2020,A Visual Analytics Framework for Contrastive Network Analysis,10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00010,48,59,Conferences,"A common network analysis task is comparison of two networks to identify unique characteristics in one network with respect to the other. For example, when comparing protein interaction networks derived from normal and cancer tissues, one essential task is to discover protein-protein interactions unique to cancer tissues. However, this task is challenging when the networks contain complex structural (and semantic) relations. To address this problem, we design ContraNA, a visual analytics framework leveraging both the power of machine learning for uncovering unique characteristics in networks and also the effectiveness of visualization for understanding such uniqueness. The basis of ContraNA is cNRL, which integrates two machine learning schemes, network representation learning (NRL) and contrastive learning (CL), to generate a low-dimensional embedding that reveals the uniqueness of one network when compared to another. ContraNA provides an interactive visualization interface to help analyze the uniqueness by relating embedding results and network structures as well as explaining the learned features by cNRL. We demonstrate the usefulness of ContraNA with two case studies using real-world datasets. We also evaluate ContraNA through a controlled user study with 12 participants on network comparison tasks. The results show that participants were able to both effectively identify unique characteristics from complex networks and interpret the results obtained from cNRL.",,Takanori Fujiwara;Jian Zhao;Francine Chen;Kwan-Liu Ma,"University of California,Davis;University of Waterloo;FX Palo Alto Laboratory;University of California,Davis",,"Contrastive learning,network representation learning,interpretability,network comparison,visual analytics,,",,0,,
VAST-conf,2020,"A Visual Analytics Approach to Debugging Cooperative, Autonomous Multi-Robot Systems’ Worldviews",10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00008,24,35,Conferences,"Autonomous multi-robot systems, where a team of robots shares information to perform tasks that are beyond an individual robot’s abilities, hold great promise for a number of applications, such as planetary exploration missions. Each robot in a multi-robot system that uses the shared-world coordination paradigm autonomously schedules which robot should perform a given task, and when, using its worldview–the robot’s internal representation of its belief about both its own state, and other robots’ states. A key problem for operators is that robots’ worldviews can fall out of sync (often due to weak communication links), leading to desynchronization of the robots’ scheduling decisions and inconsistent emergent behavior (e.g., tasks not performed, or performed by multiple robots). Operators face the time-consuming and difficult task of making sense of the robots’ scheduling decisions, detecting de-synchronizations, and pinpointing the cause by comparing every robot’s worldview. To address these challenges, we introduce MOSAIC Viewer, a visual analytics system that helps operators (i) make sense of the robots’ schedules and (ii) detect and conduct a root cause analysis of the robots’ desynchronized worldviews. Over a year-long partnership with roboticists at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, we conduct a formative study to identify the necessary system design requirements and a qualitative evaluation with 12 roboticists. We find that MOSAIC Viewer is faster- and easier-to-use than the users’ current approaches, and it allows them to stitch low-level details to formulate a high-level understanding of the robots’ schedules and detect and pinpoint the cause of the desynchronized worldviews.",,Suyun “Sandra” Bae;Federico Rossi;Joshua Vander Hook;Scott Davidoff;Kwan-Liu Ma,"University of California,Davis;California Institute of Technology,Jet Propulsion Laboratory;California Institute of Technology,Jet Propulsion Laboratory;California Institute of Technology,Jet Propulsion Laboratory;University of California,Davis",,"Multi-Robot Systems,Human-Subjects Qualitative Studies,Debugging,I.3.8 [Computer Graphics],Applications,,",,0,,
VAST-conf,2020,Visual Analytics of Multivariate Event Sequence Data in Racquet Sports,10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00009,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00009,36,47,Conferences,"In this work, we propose a generic visual analytics framework to support tactic analysis based on data collected from racquet sports (such as tennis and badminton). The proposed approach models each rally in a game as a sequence of hits (i.e., events) until one athlete scores a point. Each hit can be described with a set of attributes, such as the positions of the ball and the techniques used to hit the ball (such as drive and volley in tennis). Thus, the mentioned sequence of hits can be viewed as a multivariate event sequence. By detecting and analyzing the multivariate subsequences that frequently occur in the rallies (namely, tactical patterns), athletes can gain insights into the playing styles adopted by their opponents, and therefore help them identify systematic weaknesses of the opponents and develop counter strategies in matches. To support such analysis effectively, we propose a steerable multivariate sequential pattern mining algorithm with adjustable weights over event attributes, such that the domain expert can obtain frequent tactical patterns according to the attributes specified by himself. We also propose a re-configurable glyph design to help users simultaneously analyze multiple attributes of the hits. The framework further supports comparative analysis of the tactical patterns, e.g., for different athletes or the same athlete playing under different conditions. By applying the framework on two datasets collected in tennis and badminton matches, we demonstrate that the system is generic and effective for tactic analysis in sports and can help identify signature techniques used by individual athletes. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach based on the feedback from the domain experts.",,Jiang Wu;Ziyang Guo;Zuobin Wang;Qingyang Xu;Yingcai Wu,"Zhejiang University,The State Key Lab of CAD&CG;Zhejiang University,The State Key Lab of CAD&CG;Zhejiang University,The State Key Lab of CAD&CG;Zhejiang University,The State Key Lab of CAD&CG;Zhejiang University,The State Key Lab of CAD&CG",,"Sports Analytics,Event Sequence,Multivariate Data,Sequential Pattern Mining,Comparative Analysis,,",,0,,
VAST-conf,2020,SilkViser: A Visual Explorer of Blockchain-based Cryptocurrency Transaction Data,10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00014,95,106,Conferences,"Many blockchain-based cryptocurrencies provide users with online blockchain explorers for viewing online transaction data. However, traditional blockchain explorers mostly present transaction information in textual and tabular forms. Such forms make understanding cryptocurrency transaction mechanisms difficult for novice users (NUsers). They are also insufficiently informative for experienced users (EUsers) to recognize advanced transaction information. This study introduces a new online cryptocurrency transaction data viewing tool called SilkViser. Guided by detailed scenario and requirement analyses, we create a series of appreciating visualization designs, such as paper ledger-inspired block and blockchain visualizations and ancient copper coin-inspired transaction visualizations, to help users understand cryptocurrency transaction mechanisms and recognize advanced transaction information. We also provide a set of lightweight interactions to facilitate easy and free data exploration. Moreover, a controlled user study is conducted to quantitatively evaluate the usability and effectiveness of SilkViser. Results indicate that SilkViser can satisfy the requirements of NUsers and EUsers. Our visualization designs can compensate for the inexperience of NUsers in data viewing and attract potential users to participate in cryptocurrency transactions.",,Zengsheng Zhong;Shuirun Wei;Yeting Xu;Ying Zhao;Fangfang Zhou;Feng Luo;Ronghua Shi,"Central South University,School of Computer Sciences and Engineering,China;Central South University,School of Computer Sciences and Engineering,China;Central South University,School of Computer Sciences and Engineering,China;Central South University,School of Computer Sciences and Engineering,China;Central South University,School of Computer Sciences and Engineering,China;Central South University,School of Computer Sciences and Engineering,China;Central South University,School of Computer Sciences and Engineering,China",,"visualization,visual analytics,blockchain,cryptocurrency,interactive interface,,",,0,,
